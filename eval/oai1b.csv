TITLE: How do you get someone out of your head?

POST: Hi,
I'm 22, and I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. We recently moved together. We've always loved each other intensely.

Problem, I recently started to have feelings for an other person (a friend). This person has had a boyfriend for now 3 years, and has absolutely no ideas. Those feelings were so strong, it was hard to hide them. After 2 months of me being distant and really sad, my girlfriend forced me to say what was bothering me. I'm not a good liar, and now she knows.

We decided to give us a week alone, I went to my parents. 

Now, I'm completely lost. I keep on thinking about this person, and I hate that. I would like for those feelings to go away, to leave me alone. But I can't.  

What do I do? It's been 3 months now, and I'm just desperate.

TL;DR:","  Been with my girlfriend for 5 years, recently started to have feelings for someone else. Been with her for 3 months now, and I'm completely lost. How do I get those feelings to go away?","  long relationship; fell in love with an other person; admitted it; would like it to disappear, though it doesn't."

TITLE: So, my mom woke me up with a loud TV.

POST: She was in her living room, watching TV. This was at about 8:30 in the morning, and she was exercising. She turned the TV up extra loud to hear it over her excercycle, and woke me up. I went in there asking for her to turn it down. She said she didn't have to; I explained that I always used headphones so she didn't have to deal with my noise and that she should give me a little more respect, given that I paid rent at the time.

She disagreed. I went back to my room, rather pissed off at the lack of equality. I had no lock on my door; but I had a dresser right next to it, so I pulled one of the drawers out enough so that it caused the door to not be openable. Then, I turned my speakers up really loud and blasted Gangnam Style on repeat, with the bass cranked up as high as it could go.

If you hate Gangnam Style for being overplayed, you will see why I chose that particular song. I personally don't mind it. But here's the thing about my bass; it vibrates the walls, making one hell of a lot of noise. Needless to say, my mom was not pleased and shut off the internet. But it was oh so worth it.

Mom was not pleased and shut off the internet.,"  Mom had the TV on loud and woke me up, didn't care that I'd respected audio levels in the house, so I countered with playing Gangnam Style on repeat with the bass thumping through the walls."

TITLE: My girlfriend (20f) of two years cheated on me (20m) by kissing two guys at a Halloween party.

POST: Lately her and I have been having a few problems, and these problems have been brought up before a few times. One problem being that I don't show enough affection. I don't tell her she's pretty very often or don't compliment her much. I feel terrible about it, but this time I was really trying to change for her.

For Halloween she went to visit her step brother at a college and I got drunk with my friends and watched movies. Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.

We both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it. It makes me sick to my stomach. Should I even try to fix it or would I be better off cutting all ties.

TITLE: One year post-pregnancy, aches and pains in hips and knees, can't even comfortably do day 1 of C25k. Help?

POST: I'll try to keep this short!

**Background**

* I've always been an on again/off again (very casual!) jogger, typically doing 3 - 5 k
* My knees have always been finicky, and I went to a physio who thought I had ""runner's knee""
* Pre-pregnancy, my ""runner's knee"" would flare up when I got to the 8 - 10 k distance range, even if I had a decent base (doing a C210k type program)

**Current Problem**

I had my baby a year ago, so all in all I haven't run for about 1.5 years.  I'm quite slim and have been doing aerobics-style classes for the past year, so I'm not totally out of shape.  Body weight exercises, aerobics, bikes and ellipticals are all fine.  However, when I run even the tinyiest bit, or even go on a long walk or a hike, my pelvis gets very sore and tight, and my knees start hurting very quickly.  I already am doing general squats/lunges/stretching type things.  

I'm starting to feel like running just isn't for me anymore. Which is a bummer, because I really enjoy running!

Has anyone had something similar? Can anyone recommend some stretches or exercises that might help?  Should I see a Dr?  Or should I just see a physio?  Not quite sure how to proceed.

Thanks!

TITLE: TIFU by getting scared for no reason and peeing on myself

POST: (Pre-apology for formatting errors since i'm on my phone)

Well, this was embarrassing and happened a few minutes ago. 
I work at a small law office which shares a building with a few other businesses, a dentist's office and a military recruitment center. There is no drinking fountain in the building, so I bring a giant 2L water bottle which I sip on all day to keep hydrated and counteract all the copious amounts of alcohol i drink (after work, of course). Unfortunately, I have been cursed with a small bladder, and have to go pee sometimes 8-10 times a day. Luckily the back door of my office opens up right near the bathroom, so I can usually drain the main vein without embarrassing myself by being frequently seen there.

As I was wrapping up work for the day, I realized I would have to pee one more time before leaving. It was slightly after 5, so when I walked to the bathroom, I wasn't expecting to see anyone in there (it is the kind of bathroom with a urinal and a stall).

Fuckup begins when I open the door and there is a dude who had just finished shitting and was leaving the stall. For whatever reason this terrified me for a split second and I jumped and gasped. 

The guy was amused and chuckled and was like, did I scare you? I muttered something like ""haha, yeah, a little bit"" and I kept my head down, beelined to the urinal and unleashed the krakan. 

I was super embarrassed and very preoccupied so I didn't notice that the bottom part of my untucked, button-down shirt had slipped into my urine stream and was getting soaked. I didn't realize it until it began to sort of soak back onto my pant leg and getting my thigh wet. 

Well, fuck, i thought. This sucks. Then i remembered my fiancee was coming to pick me up straight from work so we could go grocery shopping. I cleaned up as best as i could, but its still very obvious. Luckily I have a P coat which is long enough to cover my pee-soaked netherregion, so i may get through this unscathed. My girl didn't notice yet...

TL;DR:","  Work at a law office, have small bladder, had to pee, opened door and let a guy leave the stall, pee-soaked my pant leg and thigh, fiancee saw, awkwardness ensued",  got startled for no reason by a normal dude taking a shit and then pissed on my pants and shirt due to embarrassment and now I have to go shopping in my shame-soaked pants.

TITLE: TIFU by staring too much.

POST: Unlike most tifu's I have seen, this happened today. So, to start off I am 16 years old and have started my second semester as a sophomore, in one of my new classes (team sports to be specific) I noticed a very attractive and genuinely cute girl. I have never been on dates or been romantically involved with any girls before, because I have social anxiety and I am pretty chunky and I have confidence problems because of it. Any way, back to the story, I notice this cute girl and I can't help myself and I stare at her then I gain focus and I am focused back on the game. The day continues normally until I look back and her eyes avert away from me quickly, like when you get caught staring at someone and you act like you weren't staring. So, I thought ""does she like ME?!?"" thought it might have been a coincidence but I caught her stare a few more times. So after we dress back into our normal clothes I stare at her and question. whether or not she could like a person like me. She caught my gaze this time and she turns away and talks to some dude. The dude was pretty weird but there wasn't a day when she wasn't talking to him during class. Anyway the dude gives me a dirty look and the bell rings and I thought maybe she doesn't like me maybe she was creeped out and told her possible boyfriend that I was staring at her all class. So yeah saw her walking away with the dude and I saw her eyes on me again and they avert again. Don't know her name or anything so probably creeped out the poor girl and might get confronted by the dude, also I seem like a total creep...
P.S. sorry for formatting on mobile.

TITLE: Reddit, I think our family dog just consumed a significant amount of chocolate. What do I do?

POST: Okay so my father and I went out to dinner tonight and left the dog at home. I'd left half a bar of dark chocolate (about 1.5 oz, still in the wrapper) sitting on my desk. Mind you, the bar has been sitting on the desk for about three days now and the dog hasn't done anything about it, and typically doesn't. She knows not to climb on surfaces and has shown no interest in the candy before. 

However, I returned home to find my bedroom in shambles. The contents of my desk were all knocked around and a bunch of family photos were all shredded and chewed up. I found the empty chocolate bar wrapper on the ground and still can't find the offending candy. I can only conclude that the dog has eaten it.

This is something that my dog would've done as a puppy. However, she's ten now and hasn't behaved like this in years. She's acting fine at the moment, but I'm still worried. My father doesn't seem concerned about her at all, which worries me even more.
FYI, my dog is a dachshund mix and weighs about 25-30 pounds. 
Has anybody been in this situation before? What happened? Does anybody know what to do?

TITLE: Me and my (former) best friend.

POST: I'm a 15-y.o. female, and I'm pretty sure that I just lost my long-time female best friend (a year older), who has been with me for about 4 years.

I had only two friends in school, and 'she' was one of them. We never argued a lot, but there were very rare occurrences when we didn't get along. I had already been ignored for a week once--as if my presence wasn't there at all--and I always assumed it was simply because I had said something wrong (I apologise to her, I swear). But we would always get along, eventually.

In the remaining several days before we had to part for summer, our interactions were becoming a little awkward, and it was with the knowledge that I would already be attending a different school from hers when classes return. In those days, I would see her making conversations with other students rather than me. She would always speak to my only other best friend (the three of us have been really close friends for > 4 years), and not include me in the conversation. My online messages are all unread. I have, of course, asked her if I had done something wrong; she would say ""no"", as always, without looking me in the eye.

And now she has finally blocked me in social media. 3 months have passed now, and I cannot even fathom what wrong I could have possibly done. I don't have much friends. Now that I am in a new university, I could simply forget that part of my past and move on, but I cannot bring myself to do so. You can't just forget years of shared experiences, right?
 

Hell, I even dream about her sometimes. I adore her as a great friend, no less. But in those last few days together, she'd just blatantly ignore me, and wouldn't at least tell me what I've done wrong--and that really hurts me. I'm rarely emotional, but look at me now.

Any help at all would be strongly appreciated. If it's me who's at fault, do tell--I'm open. Apologies for the long post.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to creatively announce my first pregnancy.

POST: This happened a couple months ago. My husband and I spend most of our time working in the overseas, and we recently came home to the U.S. for a year to apply for another long term visa. We decided that we should spend that year trying to have our first baby.

Within a week after making this decision, I realized I had missed my period. The next week I took three pregnancy tests at work, and that's right, my Mexican ass is knocked up. Instead of telling my husband right away, I came home from work and made a cookie cake that said ""I Got Knocked Up"" and a bunch of cupcakes with letters on it that, when unscrambled, say ""I am pregnant."" 

Here's the FU part. Since we spend a lot of time overseas, we don't have many close friends, but we had a few people we had begun hanging out with and I invited them all over that night to play Settlers of Catan. When my husband got home that night, they were all there waiting with the board set up. I brought out the cupcakes I made and told them all to unscramble them. My husband stared at the cupcakes for a minute and said, ""I am pregnant."" All our new friends were super excited, but my husband just sat there dumbstruck.

Finally, one of our friends stopped and asked my husband, ""Dude, are you just finding this out right now? Ohhh Shit."" My husband and I went into our room for about a half hour and he was pretty upset that he didn't know first and we didn't decide together how to tell people, and how he was put on the spot in front of practical strangers. But then we made up, cried, called our parents, and then rejoined our awkward guests for a game of Settlers.

TL;DR:","  Tried to creatively announce my first pregnancy by making a bunch of cupcakes that say ""I Got Knocked Up"" and inviting everyone over to play Settlers of Catan.",  I surprised announced to my husband I was pregnant in front of a bunch of a people we really didn't know.

TITLE: Knee pain due to poor balance

POST: I've had difficulty with distance running due to strong knee pain. My endurance is great, I can cycle for very long distances, but I can't run because my knees give out around 8 to 10 mies.
I went to the Orthopedist who did a full series of x-rays and pronounced my knees in excellent condition. Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and ""hip stability"" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.
So, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?

TITLE: I'm (18M) jealous of other guys flirting with my (18M) girlfriend on social media. Help?

POST: My jealousy is starting to become a problem in this relationship. Actually, it has always been. Last year, a boy my girlfriend was friends with had kept walking her to class, writing her cute notes (something boyfriends do) and asking her if she's sure about being with me. I threatened to break up with her if she never stopped talking to this guy, because he was obviously trying to make a move. Now that she's in college, she's hanging out with more guys! 75% of her friends are guys, always hanging out with her, and after the ""friend"" she had last year, I can't stop being jealous or mad about her friends. The social media part about this, guys put heart eyes on her photos on instagram, and I tell them to back the fuck up, and my girlfriend gets mad at me for confronting them! ""You don't know what they meant by them, it doesn't mean they're flirting with me."" I understand that she is right, she doesn't respond back but she obviously likes the attention she gets. My jealousy is also fueled by my friend group. My friends have dated my exes, I've been apart of closed door conversations about how some of my friends want to fuck my other friend's ex, visa versa. I would never do that to my friends, and in my world, most guys in college or highschool just want to take my girlfriend if they hang out with her. Or want to fuck her. She has already encountered a guy trying to flirt, and she gave him her number just to talk when we were arguing and on a break from our relationship. I have influenced her as well to be jealous with how i act with my anger and jealousy, but a big break up caused her to stop being clingy. Now i'm stuck being mad and jealous towards guys around her, and now I feel overprotective.

TITLE: I [22 F] want to buy my bf [28 M] of 6 months a $500 very rare video game for his collection for his birthday/Christmas. Will a gift of this caliber scare him off/ be considered too much after being laid off from his game dev job?

POST: My boyfriend's birthday is December 24th, which is Christmas Eve. He grew up in a foster home and never got great presents for either his birthday or Christmas. He often spends his birthday and Christmas alone because his foster mother is uninterested and he doesn't have a great relationship with his birth mother. 

He spent Christmas with me last year, so I went out of my way to get him both a birthday present AND a Christmas present, both of which valued above $50. However, he was so thrilled to have someone to spend his birthday and Christmas with, he showered me with 5 very nice, expensive gifts. I felt terrible. Happy, but terrible.

He is a video game artist but was recently laid off from his job. He is very passionate about his video game collection. There is one game I noticed in his collection that he only has the sequel of. I asked him why because it is very unlike him. He said it was because the original was wildly expensive and he already had a hard time affording a mint condition version of the sequel.

The cheapest, mint condition version of the game I could find is about $500. I do not make a whole ton of money, but I have saved up enough for it but now I find myself having second thoughts. I would have to buy it now or within a few months because the price skyrockets the closer it gets to Christmas. We haven't been together all that long (about 6 months) and I don't know if it would be right to drop $500 on a present just yet.

I have so many questions. Is this too much? Would it be creepy to get him something that he never asked for? What if giving him a game gives him bad feelings about getting laid off? What if we break up before Christmas and I am stuck with the game? Would the game have the same value to his collection if he didn't earn it himself?

Any help would be great. I am torn.

TITLE: My [[22m]] gf [[20]] of six months says things were going too fast and she's not capable of being with anyone right now.

POST: A little background. I met her this summer through her then boyfriend [[28]] of two years, who (as I learned later) treated her like shit, was generally abusive, cheated on her, and used violence on her. They were in a long distance relationship and see each other for about two weeks every two months. A few weeks later I invited her over for my birthday party, we got to know each other better and practically started dating (behind his back that is). Initially I didn't want to ruin their relationship but she said she no longer had any feelings for him and their relationship was going to an end. She broke up with him a few weeks later, when he came to visit her.

Our beginnings were pretty intense. We'd hang out every day, spend most of free time together, see each other almost every day and send dozens of messages every day as well. It came to a point where we practically started living together. About a month into our relationship she said that she loves me. I told her I developed feelings for her as well. We started having sex not so long after that.
Anyway, things were going pretty good for some time, until very recently, when the honemoon phase started deteriorating. I could feel someting was wrong with the way she acted towards me, she seemd sad and unhappy, so today I confroted her about it and what she said is basically that she thinks our relationship came too fast, that she feels bad about chating on her then boyfriend, and that I am a great guy (handsome, intelligent, romantic, good in bed, blah blah), but she thinks what she felt towards me was not love but affection and that this feeling is now gone. She also mentioned that she's used to being with someone significantly older, that I am way too good for her, that she is basically incapable of loving anyone right now and needs to be alone for some time. She didn't exclude being with me in the future though.

What should I do guys? I don't want to lose her, I love her.

TITLE: Me [22m] with my girlfriend [19 F] of 1 and a half years, has been having communication and trust errors as of late

POST: Everything in our relationship up until about a month ago was fantastic.  We never fought, we understood each other and acted like the bests of friends and lovers through it all.  Recently, I went back to school and our communication has been a bit strained, since I didn't do so well in last semester and have been focusing more on my studies.  

Last weekend, I could tell something was definitely wrong.  She was constantly on the phone texting, conversation seemed strained and she seemed more engrossed with her phone and because of this there were problems during sex which made it not enjoyable at all.  We confronted each other and she told me she felt as if she doesn't feel as if we're in a relationship when I'm up here because I don't text as often as I used too.  

On my end, I'm worried because a new guy friend has come into her life and she seems to be putting more time into talking to this guy than to me.  I told her I would change and nothing was threatened in terms of a break up or anything, we both agreed we want this to last.  However, I can't shake this feeling that something is up and the more and more I think about it it makes me more and more paranoid and depressed. 

I just need someones outside opinion before I do anything or say anything irrational. I truly don't want my relationship to end with her, but with all the signs I'm getting, I just don't want to get dragged through the mud for months before something bad happens to me. 

Note-my girlfriend was a lesbian before I met her.  Failed relationships with men and a bad upbringing led her to hate men for a long time and I was the first guy she dated in years.  Doubt this has any relevance but I'm just trying to put all the facts out there.

TITLE: I have begun treatment for adult ADD. I feel I have climbed out of Plato's cave. Now that my brain functions at its full capacity, I hunger for knowledge. Help me nourish my ambitions!

POST: A little background information:
My condition was overlooked until now (19) due to a combination of what I assume was my intelligence compensating for the deficit and an aversion to the idea of ADD/ADHD by a great part of my family.

I first became interested in ADD while talking to a friend about her condition and, upon further research, diagnosed myself; however, that is another story.

This thread isn't about ADD and I don't want ADD to be discussed on it.  My question stems from a new found ambitious drive and the fact that, while medicated, I am able to better access and apply my mind.  A lot of my current inspiration comes from the idea of a renaissance man, Edmond Dantes, and The Most Interesting Man in the World.

All being said, I humbly ask my fellow Redditors to answer a few questions:
(feel free to answer as many or as few as you please)

What do you wish you would have done  (to invest in yourself) when you were 18-22?

Name your top 3 books/philosophers/inspirational materials of all time.

Convince me why I should learn a specific language as opposed to any other.

Ladies of Reddit, what sort of learned habits/characteristics/hobbies/skills do  you find attractive in a Man?

What is a skill/subject I should dedicate some time to grow/learn about that will benefit me down the road?

What ideas/motifs should I attempt to avoid throughout my human experience?

Any other piece of information you would like to give me.

TITLE: Me (22f) and boyfriend (21m) of 7 years moving in together for the first time across country

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years this November. We've been together since we were 14 and 15 and have never broken up. I would have liked to live together already at this point, but his parents have a rule that we cannot get engaged, married, or live together while he's in college. 

He's just about to start his senior year of college and he's already got job interviews lined up for the west coast. He would like to work on the East or West coast while I'm hoping for West. We currently live in the Midwest (USA) but in separate houses. We're both concerned that because we've never lived together a move across the country to live together might break our relationship. I suggested that we do couples counseling. I have been in therapy personally for my own issues for about a year and have found it very helpful. We've had big fights in the past where I've brought up couples counseling, but he doesn't want to go because he feels uncomfortable with it and thinks we can fix our problems ourselves. 

I think it would be beneficial to do preventative couples counseling for this school year before we make the big move. He seems slightly more open to it than he has before because he's concerned as well and feels unprepared for the future. We have been through so much together and we're on the same page about big things like religion and children. We have a very solid foundation and there is so much love between us. We just want to be as prepared as possible so that our relationship flourishes when we move in together for the first time. 

My question is has anybody gone through something similar and what would you recommend for us to be successful? Do you think couples counseling is a good idea for us? Please share your experiences and any advice you have! Thank you very much.

TITLE: [24/m] I am that controlling boyfriend.

POST: Actually, I was that controlling boyfriend. I noticed it, but thought that it was just a little phase I was going through because of stress at work, past relationship experience, blah blah blah; but really, it doesn't seem like that was it at all.

It was pretty bad. I'd make mountains out of molehills, volcanoes out of mountains, and could find any reason in my head to think that she was deceiving me. Part of my personality is very analytic and I have a good memory, which didn't help at all. She would tell me about her day or a story from her past, and if something didn't add up I would prod and say things like, ""yeah, but you also said..."" or ""but wait, didn't you do...""

It was bad, all bad.

The worst part is that in my head, I was sure that I was really in love with her and wanted her to have freedom. But in the back of my head, I was worried that deception is everywhere and its never that easy. I would get so sure of myself, becoming condescending while I told her what she was *really* thinking or did. Then, she'd finally get the straight story through to me and I'd start bawling and apologizing. I swore up and down that it wouldn't happen again, but it always would. 

Well, the day after I called about enrolling in therapy, she dumped me. I deserved it 100% and I'm not here to ask how to get her back, because, frankly, it will never happen. But, I'm wondering what experience and insight I can find here to help me overcome this problem. I would like a healthy relationship in the future, but I am completely incapable of having one, as I am now.

TITLE: How do I end a friendship even though they haven't done anything wrong?

POST: I am in a situation that I have dreaded, and since I can't sleep, I figured I would reach out.

I(24F) was friends with a group of guys in college my first two years- it was maybe the social circle I hung out with third most? They all lived in my same dorm community and I was pretty close to one of the guys because of our shared interest in video games. The rest of them I just enjoyed the company of and because they were in close proximity, we naturally would grab meals and hang out in the dorm. I don't think we ever went to any parties or any non campus based activity. I have since lost touch with most of them.

One of them attempted to get in touch a few months ago since we now live in the same city. It seemed like he had just gotten out of a relationship. I told him we could hang out when I wasn't busy with work. He reached out to me again a few weeks ago and I ignored him. I know I probably should have addressed this then. Now he has messaged me saying that he wants to know why the animosity between us and why I'm ignoring him.

He hasn't done anything wrong, I just don't have the desire or social capacity to continue a friendship. I often move from one social circle to the next and will maybe find one person I genuinely want to be life long friends with. I find myself stretched thin just keeping up with that handful of friends. I find most of my time spent with them, my SO and my two sisters, and they make me very happy. Some past friends have figured this out about me, and with others it is a gradual growing apart. I don't know how to handle someone trying to come back into my life uninvited. I also can admit that my concern the first time that he wanted to explore a possible romance opportunity and I was having none of that.

I don't think it makes me a bad person to not continue being friends with this person, but I don't know how to end the friendship without being an asshole. r/relationships, have you ever been in a similar situation? How do I respond to this person?

TITLE: Me [21/F] with my hookup [24/M] recently few months, Advice Hookup: Go after it or stay put?

POST: I've been friends with this guy that goes to college on the same campus as me for over a year. We would always catch up and hang out between classes, and even have some homework nights that would involve wine and getting our work done. I had always had a crush on him but he is so hard to read that I thought I was completely friend zoned.

It wasn't until one night I came back from the bars early and wanted to keep drinking that I asked if he was down to hang out and drink. I went over and we drank, talked and ended up watching episode after episode of a TV show. No moves were made this entire time. Then as it reached the early hours of the morning I fell asleep during one of the episodes and he woke me up to basically making out with me and hooking up.

After this I didn't know what to do so I just sort of waited for him to say anything and I think we were both in shock so I just got dressed and we swapped a few words and I dipped out. Just recently we hooked up again after he came to a kickback I threw and we went back to his apartment with friends to play some drinking games and then I went back to my place only to get an invite to come back down. After this hookup he's the one that left me and told me was only leaving bc he had to be up in 3 hours. But we never kiss or anything after its just put on clothes and awkwardly showing each other out the door.

His friends have been pushing me to go after him and saying that he's lazy in the fact that he can want something but never really goes out of his way to get things. He also has told his friends in front of me that you cant just be friends with girls and also be attracted to them and plan to hookup because it doesn't work that way. So should I try to go after it or just keep it how it is now? My friends tell me I'm the Ice Queen and I don't show enough interest.

TITLE: Me[18F] with my partner [18M] together 1 year, thinking of moving in together

POST: We've been considering moving in together. We've really been growing in to our relationship, and despise our age have matured into it. I've had a lot of struggles through the year - including my father's death. He has not left me, or avoided me, but he supported me through it all.

We're both studying a bachelor at university (first year) - he has a decent paying job (about $400 a week), and I've been getting temporary jobs here and there (Currently working 2, and earning $500 week). If we register our relationship officially and move in together, we will both be eligible for about $400-500 of government assistance each. 

We are both ready for the challenge, and one way or another I am moving out of home. We won't be moving out until December-January, earliest. I will hopefully have a more permanent job, consistent.

I'm seeing a lot of positives to moving in together, it may help develop our relationship further and build a life. We're certainly not ready for kids or marriage or anything. Just moving in together, into a small house/flat for rent (which is pretty cheap in our town, I've looked into it).

So, money aside - I'm really focused on the good points, and I'm hoping I'm not overlooking a crucial point. Is there some dead obvious reason not to move in together? Or any good advice on handle the situation, assuming it does go through? Or good advice for figuring it out.

I want to move in with him. I want to cook with with him, and fall asleep beside him every night. I want to drag myself home after work, and have a cup of tea with him. I want to have those moments where one of us get grumpy because our assignment is due and it's not finished until 11.34pm... and the other stays up late enough to read it through that one last time before it's submitted. I want us to sort out our problems, make decisions together, and know we're in this for each other.

TITLE: Reddit, help me name a student-funded scholarship

POST: Hi reddit.  I am writing a proposal for a student-funded fellowship program for mba students at UC Davis.  Here's the deal:
Each summer, MBA students do internships.  Students interested in finance go off and work for investment banks, students interested in marketing go for advertising or market research positions with retailers or biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and students interested in energy business go for spots with utilities.   As you may guess, those internships can pay quite well.  At the same time, there are a few students who are pursue nonprofit, government, or other organizations driven by a social or environmental mission.  Those internships often don't pay at all.

So, what many schools do, is implement a student-funded fellowship program where each student that has a paid internship pledges one (or more) days salary to support the costs of those who take unpaid ones.  The idea is that the few students who commit to supporting the social and environmental bottom lines are supported by the many who are earning well on the economic bottom lines.  Kind of balancing out the 3-legged stool.

OK so this is where you all come in.  I have the proposal all written but I need a name for the fellowship.  Most everything I have come up with is a mouthful or otherwise off-target.  Here are some examples:
Nonprofit Fellowship Fund (name of the narrower program I am proposing to replace),

Social and Environmental Enterprise Fellowship,

Triple Bottom Line Fund,

Socially Responsible Internship Fund.

See, none of these are particularly inspired. Help me.

TITLE: Not sure how I (24/m) feel about girl (22/f) that I've been dating for a month

POST: So I've been dating this girl for a month and on paper we are perfect for each other. On the outside, we have a lot in common in that we like the same kind of music, same food, same movies etc, but also on the inside we are the same in that, we are both quite independent, we both are ambitious, both have the same cultural values, but most importantly we approach life the same. I have met a lot of people in my life (due to my job and how my social life is) and I genuinely have very rarely met anyone who has the same approach to life as me but who I also want to pursue a relationship with.

However I have stumbled across a problem... Normally when I like a girl, I normally fall quite fast, quite hard for them. However, with this girl, only half the time do I feel infatuated for her, while the other half I'm not very bothered. E.g. Normally when a girl doesn't text me back for a couple of hours, I get quite concerned, but with her, I don't really pay attention. I'm quite confused as to why I'm not feeling fully infatuated with her - Is it because I either:

a) Am not really that interested in her. 

b) Realise that this relationship is doomed because she is moving back to her home country at the end of next year. 

c) Am still numb from the pain that my ex-girlfriend inflicted on me when she cheated on me a year ago.

d) Am growing up/have a job and therefore the feeling of infatuation has reduced, but I'm also too busy with work to care.

e) All of the above

TITLE: Fast way to regain stamina after a run?

POST: Hey /r/running, 

Last week my teacher told me the school was organizing a run. Everybody has to take part in a 20 minute run, which is part of an 8-hour relay with everyone from the school. Or if you would like to you can form a group of 6 people and run the full 8 hours with them. 

Kind of jokingly I asked a friend of mine if he would like to do the full 8-hour run, he said yes, then someone else said she wanted to join our group, and now we're going to do it... We've decided it would be best to run in segments of 10 minutes so everyone will run eight times for ten minutes. 

Here's the thing though, my condition is not that good, at all. Last Thursday I ran 1,8km in 13 minutes and 28 seconds (8,03km/h) and today I ran 2,33km in 14:23 (9,72km/h). There are two things I would like to ask: 

-What would be a good strategy to improve my stamina so I'll be able to run for a longer time?

POST: Hi All, 

So I was totally into this girl but it is finally fizzing out. I've pretty much been in denial about the whole thing since we've ""broken up"" but it's finally now catching up to me because she's seeing someone else now. Friends and family still talk like she's my girlfriend. I know it wasn't healthy just pushing it away for so long but I need to face the music.

My family basically treated her like family because they liked her so much. I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this? 

Idk maybe I'm just kind of venting. This sucks.

TITLE: (SOMEWHAT URGENT) Training a worker that doesn't respect my authority.

POST: I got in to work today to find that I will be training someone to take over someone else's shift.

I've only been here an hour and so far, he's shooed me away from things, taken things out of my hands, interrupted me to boss customers around, and every time he does something the owner would kill him for (i.e. using the wrong soap or cups) I would let him know how he was supposed to do it, to be cut off by ""yeah yeah yeah, I know how to do it.""

Hes apparently worked at a different location previously and has forgotten a lot but insists on doing everything himself. When I try to tell him I need him to do something else he flat out says 'no.' Hes been in a phone call for the last 15 minutes.

Its just his first shift. I know I have to put my foot down. But how do I do so without starting an argument? I'm stuck here with him until 10 and will probably be training him again after today, but I need to make it clear that he DOES have to listen to me sometimes.

POST: So okay, I'm from New York but I study in Oregon for most of the year. Recently a friend of mine who I was not really close started facebook messaging me, that was about 3 months ago, since then we've talked almost everyday. She even asks when we can skype all the time and insists we do so and keep in touch. This sort of came out of the blue so naturally I just assumed she was into me. I can't really date her given that we live across the country, but I would if I could, she's really great in my opinion. Anyways we continue to speak to each other as usual and then last week I returned to new york for a break and so given that she and I share a group of friends I was hoping we could hang out together with them all for the little time where we're both in the same town. I tried to do just that but she totally gave me the cold shoulder; not being really responsive to hanging out, leaving early when we finally did etc...

Am I wrong in my original assumption that she was into me just because out of the blue she started talking to me a lot? Is she trying to play hard to get? Am I looking way too into this and maybe she was just occupied that weekend?

I really have no idea how to evaluate this. Do any of you guys have any suggestions/ideas?

TITLE: TIFU by Burning my Butthole with Cayenne Pepper

POST: So I recently found out I have scabies on my legs and stomach. 

I made a doctors appointment for treatment next week, but I figured maybe I would find some natural remedies to at least help a little because the itching was unbearable. Turns out among the tea tree and neem oils, bathing in apple cider vinegar, you could also soak the affected areas with a cayenne pepper bath. I guess the pepper literally burns the surface mites. 

Desperate as I was, I set up a bath with everything: threw in the oils, vinegar, and a fuck ton of cayenne pepper. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but I fully immersed myself in the water. I was soaking and scrubbing my legs for a few minutes when I felt a strange sensation. I paused for a moment, then yelped in pain and jumped straight out of the bathtub. My downstairs was fucking SEARING...on both ends.

I quickly drained the tub and tried to rinse out both my lady parts and butthole, but to no avail. Peeing helped a bit, but there is some definite bleeding in my backside and the burn is killing me. 
It's been about twenty minutes. As I type I lay on my bed with an ice pack on my ass, trying to ride this one out hoping it goes away.
I'm such an idiot.

TITLE: Has anyone ever felt sexual chemistry with someone the second time around but not the first?

POST: Backstory: I'm 22 (f) and a few days ago, on our third date, I finally had my first kiss/other shenanigans with someone I like very much.  But I didn't feel much - in fact I was rather bored and disappointed with the apparent discrepancy in our emotional and sexual reactions to making out.  A couple of days later I very grudgingly broke it off because I figured that's that - no sexual chemistry, and I didn't want to string him along.  But I really want this to not be the case because I rarely (obviously being 22 and only having just had my first kiss) meet guys whom I like quite like this.  Maybe it was just so new that I couldn't appreciate it and a second go-round would prove more lady-boner inducing?  Maybe sexual chemistry can pop up (har har) after developing more of an emotional connection?  Or maybe I'm just grasping at straws, and if it were possible to give it another shot I'd just put us both through more disappointment.

TITLE: I(17F) am hoping to move out of my pregnant, abusive, mothers house and in with my boyfriend (18M) after I turn 18. He still lives at his parents house, what can I do to make them more likely to agree to this situation?

POST: As the title says I need to move out of my house. My current living situation is not healthy and most days more often than not I cry for at least an hour because of my mother and how she treats me. She is also pregnant. I made a post awhile ago about this and my current situation for those of you who read this and it sounds familiar. 

My boyfriends parents have briefly offered before but I don't know if they were serious or not... We plan to ask them at some point soon, they do not know that my current home life is as bad as it is and I'm contemplating telling them when we ask if it would be a possibility.

 As a bit of a background my boyfriends older brother got a girl pregnant his senior year in high school and she lived with them for a long time(they have since moved out) she was lazy, created messes and basically left her kid with them so she could go do whatever it's is that she does. I would be coming into their home at least looking for a job but hopefully already having one, with a license (she didn't have one, only recently got one) and car, a high school graduate (she dropped out), in an abusive home, in college, plus I cook and clean which she never did. I'm really hoping these things will swing them in my favor. Also I would only be living there for around a year or a bit longer but not by much. Please no relationship judgement, I know we are young but this is pretty much my only option and we love each other dearly. 

His parents are a bit strict and weary of having another grandchild. That would work against me. At this point we aren't supposed to be in a room alone, if this happened that would be common.... 
Also we've been together over a year.

POST: Almost a year ago I met this girl on a online site and since then we have text almost every day and spoken on the phone a number of times. I don't know why we have never skyped, none of us have ever brought it up. We have however exchanged pics/videos so I'm 99.9999% she isn't some stranger from Ghana.

Now recently she said she is going somewhere and with a bit more conversation this may end up being our first meeting as I've been looking to go somewhere and she suggested that I go with her as at least she'd roughly know someone. 

She is an incredibly nicest person and we have spoken about past relationships, she said she isn't one to judge and I've spoken/seen people she has been out with before and she herself described them as ""not exactly lookers"", so I'm not afraid of her seeing me and being like ""what kind of creature are you"" as I'm not exactly overweight or hard to look at.

POST: Hello /r/jobs, I graduated a few months ago and had no luck so far to get a job in marketing/sales. 

There's a small local company (perhaps 30 employees) but they are actually pretty successful in what they're doing (known worldwide). I checked their website and it's awful. Looks like a website from the early 2000's. So I guess they are not pretty good in (online-)marketing. 

I would like to do a cold application (not sure if they are looking for a marketing guy) but I had no luck with this kind of application in the past. That's why I thought I try something different. I have good skills in photoshop, indesign and illustrator. As a teenager I also built websites using HTML, so I thought I build a dummy website fitted to their company and attach some screenshots to my application.

What do you think? I this a feasible idea or will they be offended?

Thank you very much in advance.

TITLE: My boyfriend (34F) gave me an ultimatum, I realized it's a deal breaker for me(29F). He's still a good person and I'm lost on how to proceed with the breakup.

POST: We've been together three years. He has a degree (communications), tried to go back for another (more useful) one and got burnt out. He works a dead end job now, but is happy, which is important to me. But I'm also frustrated because I feel like I have more responsibilities in our relationship. I carry him on my insurance, pay for our car (which I do use more), make our house budget/cleaning chart and am trying to save up for a house for us.

For two years, he told me this job was temporary while he figured out which direction he wanted to go with his career. Last night he sat me down and told me he needed to give me an ultimatum (his words, ""I don't mean it to be one, but it is""). He knows his job isn't what I want him to be doing but he's okay with it. He appreciates that I've been trying to support him figuring it out, but he's going to stop that and just live in the moment....for now. He knows himself and when he figures it out, he'll be passionate and dive in. 

At the time, I was relieved to hear him tell me straight up.....but after a night of sleep and a day to digest everything he said, the full weight is sinking in. This is a deal breaker for me. I respect his reasons (personal happiness is really important) and wish him well (he's a good person), but I've never been in this spot before. All my past relationships ended with fireworks, drama, tears.... this feels very ""we both are in different places."" 

Our lease is up at the end of June. Do I say something now? Wait until a month out? All these feelings just hit me on my lunch break and I'm starting to panic! I know it will be a hard breakup in the sense that we both love one another and neither did anything wrong, but that just knots my stomach even more! I don't want to make him feel guilty.

POST: Sorry in advance for the wall of text this seems to be! I didn't' mean for it.
Earlier this week, my ex dumped me because she said she couldn't be a good student (we are both in university) and a good girlfriend. Before this all happened we couldn't really see each other very much but we still texted and tried out best.

I've always been there for her and optimistic that we would find the time when we could to make the most of it. I drove her home from a weekend staying in our hometown and we try to figure things out but it ends up we break up and I'm heartbroken

I still drive her home and do my best but she sends me a long message saying that she can't bare to see pictures of me with friends or in a relationship so she deletes me. I'm confused about the whole situation but somehow talk myself into that it's for the best. 

The next day when I come home from school I see a bag on the doorstep. When I look inside its all the things I gave her through the time together. I was crushed. I felt betrayed, lonely, and couldn't understand what I did to deserve this. I quickly glance at her roommate's Facebook and see that they went out downtown and I think the worse. Of all the years I've known her, I've never seen her act like this.

Now that it has been some time I am doing better. I try not to look too much into what she is doing but I feel wrong and I have urges to at least Facebook her or say hey at school. I was wondering if anyone else could relate or provide some guidance.

TITLE: Me [22F] and my boyfriend [21 M] dated for a year, he ended it two months ago and he's just now figured out that I'm ""it""

POST: I'm a senior in college right now and my boyfriend and I had been dating for about a year when he ended it very abruptly about 2 months ago. With that it ended pretty explosively. The initial breakup was - as normal - upsetting but fine. Within days though he was pestering me via text and through mutual friends, constantly trying to get me to talk to him. Basically, when I went back to his place to get my stuff back, it ended in an extremely heated argument with lots of yelling on his end.

Fastforward 2 months and we've just gotten back from our separate spring breaks. I come home to a text from him saying that breaking up with me was the biggest mistake of his life and that he would like an opportunity to talk and a chance to prove his worth to me. We ended up talking for a long time during which we talked about what had happened during our relationship and he explained to me that he broke up with me because he was intimidated by the fact that I had a job so long before him and that there were some pretty bad problems going on at home that he felt he couldn't talk to me about.

We've been texting a little over the past few days since I said we could try being friends. Tonight though, I received a long text from him saying basically he would like to date me again because he has realized that I am ""the one"" and he wants a second chance.

So confused here, I have no idea what to do and I am feeling incredibly torn. Any advice would be much appreciated.

TITLE: Is it really possible to meet the right person at the wrong time?

POST: This past October I (19F) met a really great guy (20M) through tinder. We went on a few dates here and there and got along really well.

However, we did run into some problems when it came to hanging out. If I had some free time, he would be working or in school (does both full time). And if he had free time I'd be in school or not home at the time (plus, I don't have my license yet so transportation was a factor too). This made it really difficult for us to hang out and see each other more. 

Today, we started talking on snapchat and he told me he doesn't think this can work anymore. I was crushed because I was really starting to like him and he even told me he had feelings for me as well. He said he just wants to work on himself for a while. I asked him if it's possible if things do work out in the future will he reconsider trying again. He didn't give me a straight answer saying it just depends on when it happens. 

So my question for you /r/relationships is it possible to meet the right person at the wrong time? And if yes, can things work out in the end? I'm really hurt right now and don't know how to feel because this has never happened to me before.

POST: Quick run down of the relationship:

Whirlwind romance and 6 months later Married young (20 and 19 respectively), together for 14 years, 2 kids over the course of it. In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.

For a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to ""evaluate her feelings"", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of ""us"", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.

After a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical/mental affection (often not both at the same time).

Is this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?
Should i be open about my feelings and experiences (we made a clause on breakup, she didnt want to know anything i did with other people while we were separated, and told me to lie if i had done anything) or would that just end everything, and if it did is that for the best?

If someone could just live my life for me for a bit and give it back in a few months that would be grand :D

I know she is interested in me at the least as a friend, but I am not fully confident if she is interested as anything more (we've only met a couple days, I'm about 60-70% sure she's interested in me beyond friendship - I thought I heard her asking her friend if it was okay to sleep over at my place but I'm not sure).

I don't have a problem with LDRs provided they are serious but to be honest, I have my own life and school to focus on now anyway. I don't think I want a relationship as of the current moment. I'm more interested in down the road - this is the first girl that I met that is astoundingly pretty, captivating, and is part of my exact same culture (families are pretty much the exact same which I value a lot). Practically speaking, it's perfect material for a serious relationship save for the fact that she lives far away. Which pretty much renders the whole thing impractical as of the moment.

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell while driving

POST: I'll start from this morning. It was a normal day for me. I woke up at around 7:30 as I usually do so I could wake up and get to work on time. I did so, worked my 8 hours, clocked in, clocked out. My coworkers wanted to go out to get something to eat, but I wasn't feeling social today, so I passed and walked to my car.

However, I was feeling rather hungry. I'm currently on a diet, but I've been on it for a rather long time (around 6 months) so I had forgotten what the taste of a deliciously disgusting Taco Bell taco tasted like. Once I started thinking about it, I couldn't stop so I set my course to the nearest Taco Bell about 15 minutes away.

After driving for a bit I finally reached my destination. I pulled up to the drive-thru, placed my order for 2 tacos, a crunchwrap and a large Mountain Dew. I pulled up to the next window, paid for my order, and sat the bag of food on the passenger seat next to me. I checked my phone to see what time it was, and determined that I had enough time to eat in a parking space and be home in time for my family. 

Let's just say I fucking ravaged those first 2 tacos. I scarfed them down like I've never seen what a scrap of food looked like before. As I'm about to move onto my crunchwrap, I get a phonecall from my wife asking where I am.

""You're at Taco Bell?! You said you'd drive Caitlyn (our daughter) to soccer practice!""

Shit. I hung up the phone and stepped on the gas with one hand on the wheel and another on my crunchwrap. I was doing 70 on the highway trying to rush back to get my daughter there on time. 

But that crunchwrap was way to delicious. I was paying too much attention to the deliciousness, the amazingness, the...

I felt a thud. My windshield cracked. I pulled over and stepped out of my car to what was the remains of a now dead deer and a busted windshield along with other damages to my car. Caitlyn was late to practice.

TITLE: Me [18F] with the guy [24~M] I've been seeing for a month, not sure if i should mention him to my judgmental family at Easter.

POST: I'm very happy with this guy so far, we've been getting along great. We've got good communication and we're on the same page about where we are and where we see things going. 

This weekend he's meeting my family, but just my parents and siblings. He's also invited me over to meet his family for a while on Easter, which i'm very excited about. 

However, I'm also going to be spending part of Easter with my extended family. Many of these relatives tend to be somewhat judgmental and disapproving of my relationships. Not the *people* I date, but how many people I've dated, and that I put these relationships on facebook (because ""people can see how many people you date, and might think you're promiscuous""). I've had my fair share of relationships, but never more than 2 in one year. 

I originally wanted to hold off on talking about him until things got more serious, hoping that my family would take me more seriously. However, I also don't want to appear ashamed of him, or like I'm trying to hide him. I appriciate that he has been so open about me meeting his family, and want to be able to share my family with him too.

TL;DR:","  Been seeing a guy for a month, meeting his family this weekend. Also going to spend part of Easter with extended family. Should I mention him to my judgmental family at Easter?","  My relatives are skeptical of how many people I've dated, which makes me hesitant to talk about the guy i'm seeing; would it be better to mention him now, or to hold off and see how things go?"

TITLE: A little help please?

POST: So, I've been in a relationship with my (now ex) girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years and it just ended suddenly tonight. I guess it was because of a lot of stuff that's been building up throughout our relationship. It is long distance because I'm away at college so I definitely understand why things went sour. For clarification, I broke up with her. She was fairly controlling throughout our relationship and was also extremely clingy. I never really got any appreciation for the stuff I did for her and she is also an extremely jealous person. I'm the only person that she has to rely on when she needs someone and she expects me to be at her side at the drop of a hat. We had different views on a lot of things, including religion, marriage, and children, but we were extremely serious and considering engagement in the future. Fiscally, she wasn't really appropriate for me because she is a rather large spender while I prefer to save our money. Unfortunately, I would give in on these whims and now I don't really have much to show for working throughout my high school career. Although things haven't been that good for us when we are away from one another, they are typically really good when we are together. After breaking up with her, she told me that she was going to change everything that I dislike about her because she had figured all of this out already and was wanting to fix it before anything bad happened. I told her that it was a little too late because these problems have come up before and they were never fixed, but she insisted that she would keep trying she also said that she hopes that we can get back together some time in the future. I really don't know how to handle the situation, Reddit. Can you help me out? Do I stay friends with her? Do I give her another chance? Do I try to experience more of the college lifestyle and meet other girls and date them? Any advice you can offer is greatly appreciated.

I threw the book across the room and bawled like I haven't since my best friend died. I don't know why.. Everything came rushing back. I thought about where I'd been, where I'm going..

I thought about how people in the world are suffering while I am sitting in America. I thought about too many things at once, and it took me a good 15 minutes to come down from that emotional high.

TITLE: Do I move back in with my boyfriend?

POST: I'm a 22/F with a 23/M and we've been together for 2.5 years. Our relationship is loving and happy, and due to the fact that we live approximately 45 minutes away from each other (both living with our parents [embarrassing, but resources we're lucky to have]) have to restrict our visits to about 2 days a week. 

We did the 2 days a week for a year and a half, then we got an apartment together for 6 months. When we lived together life was wonderful, and I couldn't ask for better. Due to various financial difficulties compounded by extreme family crises, we both moved back to our parents' homes until the crises were dealt with and we had enough saved up to move out again. The time to move out of my parents' house is coming up,  I'm unsure if when I move back out it should be with him.

It has always been extremely important to me that I live by myself for at least a year, at some (relatively early) point in my adult life. My mom drilled in to me that you must learn to be alone in order to function well within relationships, and I think at this point I would feel like I had missed out on something major if I didn't experience living on my own soon. 

I've talked about this with my boyfriend and he understands/encourages me to do what I need to do, but I don't want to move without him. So much of my relationship with him has been spent with strict limits on time that when the opportunity arises to live with him again I know I won't want to say ""No"". Plus, it just seems like a huge economic waste for us both to be paying for an apartment, Internet, etc. etc., when we could just be splitting the bill (our low incomes plays a role in my trepidation as well), when he moves to the same city I'm moving to.

TL;DR:","  Been with boyfriend for 2.5 years, living with parents now. Time to move out is near, do I move back in with him? Or would it be a huge waste of money?","  I want to live with my boyfriend, but will feel as though I missed out on a formative experience unless I live alone (soon)."

For the past year, I used my ex as an emotional punchbag. I have been going through issues which have left myself emotionally unable to stop myself from saying things and blowing up out of proportion. I was recently diagnosed with bpd which I was worried about and basically, I used her as that emotional punchbag for a year before we split. 

I have since come to terms with the fact that I completely cocked up, pushed her away and used her for my problems. I have really felt bad about it and I have told her I love her. She doesn't say anything back but I know that when she hears it, she changes her attitude for the better. 

I really want to get back with her and put this behind us. I know there's something still there even if the chances are small. I would jump at the opportunity no matter how small to show that I have come to terms with who I am and what is wrong with me.

TITLE: Me [18 F] with my Boyfriend [26 M] 8 months, my sex drive is bigger than his

POST: I've been dating Boyfriend for about 8 months, and this isn't a huge problem or a deal breaker. I love him a lot and we have plans on marrying when I'm done with university. Unfortunately, this has been a problem for a long while now, and it's really been getting troublesome these past couple days.

See, the more time goes on, the more sex I want to have with him. I see sex as one of the few ways that I feel close to him. For him, though, sex is just an extra thing to do with the person he loves. Which is fine, except that there are days when he's just too tired to do things. And while I respect that, those also happen to be the days where I see him the least, which makes me want to feel close to him even more. It hurts to be turned down, and it hurts him to hurt me, and it hurts me to hurt him, so on and so forth. While its only been this difficult these past couple of days, we both agree that this is kind of a problem that should be resolved sooner rather than be held off.

My position is to change, and that it's my own problem that I have to deal with. He doesn't think I should, though, and that there's some middle ground that we can reach that works. I'm really not sure what to do. Masturbation doesn't really work, and forcing him to put out is not an option.

TITLE: My bf [23] doesn't speak of his childhood, but I[f22] know he's traumatized.

POST: We were friends for 10 years, before we got together. He than told me once about his terrible childhood. (He told only 3 of his friends his story)

Now we're a couple for quite a few months and well, sometimes there's stuff I know that reminds him of his childhood, but it's like he's forgotten that he had told me. So he keeps pretending that nothing happened.

Some examples
Lately we were watching an old TVshow, that every child watched when we're young, like Sesamestreet, and he couldn't remember a thing. (Which I think is because he forced himself to forget everything.)
He likes christmas, but only the food, not the stuff with Santa, and he hates to get presents. (Which is the thing childs like the most about christmas.)
And stuff like watching TVshows about raising children. We talk about how we're going to raise ours in the future and that we won't will be as horrible as the parents on TV. (But striking, the things he thinks are important are always the things his parents should have done, to save him from the traumatizing stuff.)

I know he likes to put his problems far away. But on the other hand, I'm his girlfriend now and we're pretty serious, isn't it good to speak about it maybe just once, so he knows I know his secret/won't tell, and most of all, I'm always there for him?

What do you think?

TITLE: Me (28F) with my (32F) sister. She has been struggling to get pregnant for well over a year. My husband and I started trying and I'm pregnant within the month. How can I approach this with sensitivity without overthinking everything?

POST: Hi reddit! I've created this new account for anonymity. 

My sister and I have a good relationship despite living half way around the world from one another. I recently found out I was pregnant and figured I shouldn't overthink it and just tell her as I would have told her in the past (before knowing about her visits with fertility doctors etc). She responded very sweetly and is texting me asking several excited questions and there doesn't seem to be any weirdness at all. She seems genuinely thrilled that I'm going to be a mum!

However, I'm still a little worried and overthinking things in my head. I am worried that deep down she is sad and how I should best respect her feelings without making it an issue. The fertility issues she is having would have stayed between her and her husband had it not been for an awkward visit with my mother. My mum visited her (my parents also live in a different country.) and she had to tell my mum because there were so many secret appointments etc. My mum is not the most tactful person and rather than understand it was a private issue just got incredibly excited they were trying, to the point that when she left their house she left a note and candles in their bedroom wishing them luck. Cringe. So my sister and I have been bonding over how cheesy our mum is being.

I'm looking for advice on how to go forward. Should I just pretend that everything is normal and follow her cues? Should I be more sensitive about the subject because of what she is going through?

I can't help but feel guilty. I wasn't going to share with her how long we were trying but when she asked I couldn't lie to her. I feel awful that I got to tell the family happy news before she could. I feel guilty as a little sister to be pregnant before my big sister who deserves it so much. I started trying because it's the right time in my life but I was prepared for it to take much longer! I can't help but wish I had waited a little longer until she could have her moment.

And we were out there all damn day. So I've barely had the muscle strength in my forearms to grip just about anything. Opening the fridge? Nope, grabbing my backpack? Fucking nope.

What worsens things is that I am pretty shy and nerdy, and since more reactive than initiative. She is the type of girl though who expects initiative in a relationship. 

I told her about my feelings and we have never touched this theme since. The furtherst we've gone physically is holding each other's hands and hugging but I am not sure if it's more a courtesy of friendship. She did mention that she is not that much satisfied with her current relationship, though she tries avoiding exclusive hang-outs with me inviting others because ""it's more fun"".

I am not sure what would be the best way to go now. Most of all I want to  know if she has some deeper feelings to me. The reason is that I would hate ruining our friendship by pushing too far. But how could I find it out, revealing it in a conversation is not an option since it would be too selfish and I guess she is equally unsure about my intentions. And I think that staying by friends and seeing what happens   I will just be locked in the friend zone.

TITLE: TIP my friend by grounding him

POST: The Background:
You read it right, I didn't get him grounded, I actually grounded him. This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.
Events Leading to the Prank:
Now, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.
The Setup:
I got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.
The Execution:
You can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo

TL;DR:","  Tried to prank my friend by messing with his phone, a fire drill saved the day and I told him he had to pay for his broken retainer.

POST: Hi Reddit,

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I think I saw a thread with a similar question but I can't seem to find it now so any advice is appreciated.

I started seeing my BF about 3 months ago and he is really incredible. He's witty and kind and I find him incredibly, incredibly handsome and dashing. I think I'm a fairly average looking woman and get hit on from time to time, but I've noticed that it has gotten more aggressive or nasty with my boyfriend around? When a guy hits on me, I'll usually just say thank you but I'm not interested or I have a boyfriend. If my boyfriend is there with me, some guys will give him a full once over and say something along the lines of ""This guy?"" or ""You're outta his league"" or ""I could show you a better time"". Something completely disrespectful to my bf. I don't know where it's coming and he doesn't usually react. I'm not the most confident person so I'll usually just say that was rude or ignore it, but I want to know how I could react or what I could do to reassure my bf in those times. I know if it were me, I'd probably be a bit self conscious or upset but he hasn't said anything. I've tried to bring it up but he brushes it off like it isn't a big deal and maybe it isn't. I don't want to make it seem like a big deal if he's actually not upset, but I also want to make sure he's feeling good about us after this.

Sorry for the rambling! So people of reddit, I'm just wondering how you would like your SO to respond to those guys or what you'd like him/her to do afterwards or say to make you feel secure in the relationship.

Thanks!

TITLE: I [21 F] feel like I deserved to get hit by my dad.

POST: First off, I'm on mobile so sorry for any errors.

 I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 and a half years and things are going great between us. We're both seniors in college and we're just honestly so excited to see what life has in store for the both of us. But I'll just admit this here: I've been sneaking him in so we can spend alone time with each other. My parents didn't know any of this was happening until my dad came home super early from work Friday and caught us. I was in the shower while my boyfriend was in my room, which is downstairs. I opened the window and made him hop my fence before my dad could see him. Needless to say, my dad and my mom have been very disappointed in me (for good reason) but my dad built up his anger against me and let it all go today. When he drove us home from the baby shower my sisters and I went to, he yelled at me for not picking up my phone whe he called it. My excuse  (albeit a bad one I admit) was that I was helping my aunt and the rest of my family clean up their apartment's party room after the baby shower and I couldn't feel my phone vibrate.

TITLE: [NSV] Finally broke the compulsive eating cycle

POST: I've been struggling for some time with compulsive overeating habits. I've been sticking to a reasonable 1,700 calorie diet over the last 5 weeks with the aim of making a lifestyle change and hoping that, as a result, my weight would drop too. This morning I finally stepped on the scale and saw I was worthy of my first flair (after 5 weeks) yay!

But then I had a crappy day at work, ate too much for lunch and on the way home all I could think about was a giant, comforting meal of  pizza, or french fries, or mac and cheese, or Chinese food, or anything fatty and greasy. When I got home, my roommate even asked if I wanted to order dinner later and I initially said yes. Then I thought long and hard about what I really wanted. I wanted something that made me feel cozy and comforted, that was warm and rich. So I changed into my favorite pjs, fired up the kettle, made myself a giant mug filled with chicken broth, and curled up in bed. As I sipped the broth, my bad mood passed, I felt satisfied, and no longer wanted take out or crappy food. I made myself a giant salad for dinner instead.

TL;DR:",  Finally broke the compulsive eating cycle by making myself a comforting meal of chicken broth and vegetables instead of unhealthy food. Feeling much better and no longer want to overeat.,"  When cravings hit, think about what the food you're craving really represents. Have a healthy option (food or otherwise) on hand that can fulfill the same purpose."

TITLE: I am in the financial and insurance industry, but is looking to go back to school to become a vet.  Any suggessions?

POST: I'm not 100% sure if I have what it takes to make this huge change, but I feel like being a Veternarian is something I really want to do in life.  
     A bit of background. I'm currently 24, graduated with a finance degree 3 years ago. I'm currently a financial rep focusing on selling insurance.  Even though I don't hate my job I feel like it doesn't fit my personality.  But I stuck with it for a while because I don't like to quit easily. The idea of becoming a vet happened when a chinchilla of mine 
passed because I didn't take it to the vet in time, and I really love 
animals. People tell me I'm a warm person and great with kids and 
animals. I feel like this is something I came up with myself and not what other want me to be.
     So back to reality, I did a tiny bit of research on this. The closest grad school that has this program is Cornell university (I'm located in NY) I'd probably need to do an undergrad in science or medical field.  I'm a little unsure of 8 more years of school, but I guess if there's no other choice.  Another concern is money, I only have about 10k in bank, I cannot touch my retirement and life insurance money. I'm not sure if I can qualify for any federal grant. I may also need to move back with my parents. One idea I have is to just brokage product with high residuals while I wait to get into a school. I'll also appraciate any insight and experiences from a vet or a person going back to school.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] 1 year, LDR trial separation

POST: I need to get this off my chest and get some advice from the community.

My gf and I have been doing long distance for about 5 months and dating for 1 year. We will be living in the same city again come June hence why we decided to give a LDR a try. 

The time we spend together has been great and we usually see each other for long weekends every couple of weeks. 

A few months ago I found out that my gf cheated on me (she kissed another guy in a club). I decided to give her a last chance but if I'm entirely honest, since it happened I have not taken the relationship as seriously as I used to. 

This weekend, I went down to see her (hadn't seen her in 3 weeks). I got her flowers, chocolates and a card for valentine's day. She spent most of the day with her friends and I didn't even get a card in return. In the evening I cooked her a nice dinner, then we had a bit of a fall out and she spent the rest of the evening hanging out with friends. 

Needless to say, this morning I was pretty fed up and have initiated a 2 week ""trial break-up"". She was really upset. We won't be talking for 2 weeks and will then meet up to decide whether to end it or continue.

Am I being perfectly reasonable here or am I just being overly sensitive? Obviously I love her to bits and the text above is only really showing her in bad light - but these are the things I'm picking up on. Our sex life isn't great either. She has a slight cold and so there was no love making this weekend (even after not seeing each other for 3 weeks).

TL;DR:","  Gf cheated on me, gave her a last chance but am feeling really fed up with the relationship and have initiated a 2 week trial break-up. Am I being unreasonable for feeling this way?","  1 year relationship, LDR for last 5 months. Things have been going downhill so just initiated a 2 week ""trial break-up""."

POST: About a year and a half ago, I found I hand depression. Now depression to a person that has never had it and just hears it might label it as being sad and angry and down alot. 
Depression is actually much more than that, and it is hard to explain so I have a link here on 13 things to remember about a person with depression 

Basically, without creating an excuse, I was a bit rude,pushy and angry plus other things to some wonderful ladies I have met. One who has been absolutely incredible and I appreciate so much. I like talking to them and hanging out with them when I can. They have helped alot, I am getting better 

I dont ask here because I would not treat a women different when apologizing or that I want to sound stupid, I just want them to feel like my apology was genuine not like im giving them crap and will still be that way. What does everyone suggest I say? Do I tell them I have depression?

TITLE: Reddit, what's the stupidest thing that you've done that has caused, or could have caused a severe injury to you?

POST: With me, it just happened yesterday.  I woke up early in the morning with sharp stomach pains, thinking I had to pee or something and that my bladder was just too full.  After going to the bathroom it still hurt really bad and I was literally sobbing.

I didn't want to go to urgent care because I was sure they'd send me home saying I just had super bad gas or something else embarrassing.  Thankfully my boyfriend talked me into it, and upon finding that Urgent care wasn't open yet we went to the ER and got there within an hour after my pains started.  After getting there they started to calm down, so now I was even more sure that it was somethign dumb and I was just going to be embarrassed.

After getting bloodwork done and a cat scan, the doctor comes in and informs me that I have appendicitis and need my appendix removed.  I was in surgery by 12:30 and have been on pain killers since yesterday and will be released either tonight or tomorrow.

So, if it wasn't for my boyfriend being more stubborn than me I could have had my appendix rupture and died, since we only have one car and he brought me to the hospital 20 minutes before he would have had to leave for work.

TITLE: Confused virgin, initiating everything with girlfriend, feeling bad afterwards.

POST: Okay....so me and this girl, we've been dating for two months now. She's a virgin, and I'm a virgin. Hell, she's so innocent, it's not even funny.

But, we've recently started to get a lot more physical. From about the second week, we've been sleeping together. As in, we would cuddle and then sleep in the same bed. We might make out a little bit, but it was mostly the cuddling and the sleeping.

Then, I started with the dry-humping, and she reciprocated, and clothes started coming off. Only above the waist, however. I quickly learned how to properly take off a bra.

And then, just within this last week, we moved to third base. It started with me rubbing outside of the shorts she wore to bed, and then I asked if she minded me moving inside the shorts, and she said no, so I did. And she's given me a handjob before too. Mostly, though, I feel like it's been me.

And I want it, in the moment. And she wants it--she never hasn't wanted it. But, afterwards, I always feel like shit. I wouldn't say I regret it, but I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for initiating it, and for almost pushing the boundaries.

I guess, what I'm asking here more than anything, is that should this be happening? Is this one of those things that should just *feel* right from the moment you're doing it? Like, when you're doing it and when you're not? As bad as this sounds, could it be a sign that she's not really ""the one"" and that, knowing that, I should break up with her?

TITLE: Bestfriend [M/19] gets girlfriend, drops me [F/19] like a rock

POST: We've been friends for about 4(ish?) years. We've always been pretty close. Unfortunately, whenever he gets a girlfriend he starts ignoring me. This time is worse than usual though, since we're both in college in different states.

Basically, this summer we took a class at my school (cheaper for him since his school is out of state) and he stayed at my house (because gas). Class lasts a month. When the class ends, he goes back to school and I pretty much haven't heard from him since. 

Its been a month, and I've tried texting him and calling him but he ignores me. He called once to say he was sorry and make excuses (he's ""busy"") and he referenced things I told him in my text messages, so obviously he's reading them, but just not bothering to respond.

I just don't understand what's going on with him. I go from talking to him every day to being completely cut off. I can't just talk to him about it because he'll just ignore me. I don't know if its because he's got a gf now so he doesn't need meanymore, or if we're just doing the whole ""growing apart"" thing way more rapidly than I expected. 

I really just want to get some perspective on this, because its really upsetting me. Also, last school year he didn't have a girlfriend and we talked pretty much every day. So I'm just assuming this has something to do with her.

TITLE: I [16 M] want to supportmy grieving girlfriend[15F] after an abortion, but she wants space.

POST: I understand that she needs space to grieve, and that she needs to come to grips with what happened, after the abortion, i was her only shoulder to cry on,of course her parents were there to support and talk to, but she didn't want to due to fear, shame and embarrassment. 

So after the abortion we thought it would be a breeze, that wasn't the case, it happened around 3/4 months ago and our relationship hasn't been the same, for around 3 months after it was constant battling at eachother and tears of what happened but i'd always support her.

My mum and a close friend have told me to not text her at all, wait for her to come to, open the door, then come in and pick everything up again. But i had to text her and just let her know im waiting for her and would never abandon her, any hour of the day i would be here. The reason im worrying is because she has one therapy session a week, and she doesn't talk to her mum about it as much as she should, she's even admitted shes depressed and i could see it.

Her exact reply to my text was ""That definitely put a smile on my face! So nice to hear that fro you, you mean everything to me still and just for you to understand that honestly makes me the happiest person alive""

The problem is, i don't want her bottling everything up and not speaking to anyone, i hate knowing she could be sat upset, feeling alone, and of course i don't want,after all this space, her to think i was never here from her, feelings to go,and to get a wrong impression of me.

What shall i do?
Should i call or text her at all?
Should i just let her come to me?

TITLE: So I just found out my girlfriend is unhappy in our relationship [4-1/2 yrs, 24/m 23/f]

POST: I really hope you guys can help me on this one.

So I'm very technology savvy. I have worked in computer repair and the IT field for the last 7 years.

I met my girlfriend her freshmen year of college (I was a sophomore transfer) and we've been dating each other our entire college career. She's graduating this year (I graduated last year and came back for an MS). I worked on her computer about a month ago because it was running slow, freezing, etc. so I looked at it over a night. While I had her computer, my curiosity got the best of me.

I found myself in a junk folder that had a lot of misc stuff in it, under which I found a pro-con list that turned out to be about myself; the things she liked (pros) and the things she didn't like (cons). I saw it and it kind of shook me up. I didn't sleep well that night, as I drempt she broke up with me. The next morning I told her about the dream. She consoled me and said she wasn't breaking up with me anytime soon.

Moving on, I found she had created an account on a dating advice forum, and I found all of her posts. The first ones were from back when she was in high school. Later on she posted about us. The most recent one was a day before our four year anniversary. It was asking for advice on how to break up with me because she is no longer happy in the relationship. In it she states that some of her friends and family have been telling her to break up with me for well over a year. We're involved in a lot of the same things, so it would be awkward for both of us to break up.

It's now 8 months later. I have never seen any signs from her personally that she is displeased with our relationship. I love her so much, but now that I've seen this, I feel she just puts up a front to make me happy and not make life a living hell while we still spend time together.

TITLE: X-post from r/relationships: [Throwaway] My housemate has been evicted, but seems to be refusing to collect his stuff. What now? (United Kingdom)

POST: Am located in the UK. 

Two weeks ago, my housemate was evicted after a spate of horrible behaviour and 'forgetting' to pay his rent. The landlord is taking him to court over the late rent payments (which amount to several thousand pounds), which he didn't think he'd have to pay if he moved out right away.

He has left everything apart from his laptop. That includes bedding, clothes and loads of personal items that I'm sure are worth a lot of money. He doesn't seem to understand that he needs to come and get it, saying that he'll ""come when he wants"". As far as I know, he hasn't even contacted any housing agencies to try and get a new place.

I don't want to be stuck with his stuff until he finds a new place; I have new tenants moving in! I've contacted the city council but they just said to wait and see if he came to get it, which wasn't really helpful.

Does Reddit have any advice at all? Anything would help!

On the last night, my dad had gotten properly drunk with some of the locals. On his way back he insisted that we go ""quilling"". 
For those not familiar with this sport, it involves a car, a bunch of drunk friends, some towels, and a shit load of porcupines. Basically, my dad convinced my mom to drive around backroads at about 230 in the morning trying to find porcupines. When we saw some on the road, my friend and i would jump out, chase them down and whip them with towels to see how many of their quills we could get. (their quills grow back and its painless for them, bring on PETA). All in all we came back with 200 some quills and a bunch of good memories.

TITLE: I[22M] Completely hung up on friend[25F]

POST: Hey Reddit!

So, for some back story I've been going out with this girl for sometime. We met about a year ago, went out a few times, i'd say we hit it off and I definitely liked her. We decided not to ""date"" for a few different reason but did the friends with benefits thing for a few months. She ended up trying to see someone else a few months ago and contact pretty much stopped between us. We would talk here and there, all started by me, but that was it for the most part.

Around mid January we started to casually do things again. Turns out what she was doing with this other guy didn't work out and I was happy because I had my friend back. We have since gone out a few times and some of the nights we even ended up hooking up again. Coming to last weekend, we went out and at the end of the night it was awkward. I tried to initiate a kiss with her and she didn't want much to do with it. The next day we talked for a while through text, and decided that were good friends and doing things probably isn't going to end up well, which i agree with.

My problem though is that I am so hung up on her. I definitely have more feelings for her than she realizes and i'm in a strange spot and have no idea what to do. She is an extremely important person to me, and I don't want her out of my life but I am killing myself with these thoughts and feelings that I keep having.

I'm an 18 year old high school student who's in their final year. About 2 months ago I was accepted to my dream school, and as such I'll be going off their in August. I'm extremely happy about it, it's one of the best schools in my country, and the place itself is beautiful. Needless to say, this relatively early university acceptance was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. 

But for whatever reason, I can't find it in myself to be happy. Most kids my age would be ecstatic and hopeful for the future. And while I am happy that I'll be moving out on my own, I can't help but feel incredible emptiness. Every night I just waste away the day browsing internet forums or listening to music. My usual hobby of videogames can't grip me like it used to; any time I try a new game I lose interest after a few hours, maybe a few days if I'm lucky. The only thing that can hold my attention for more than a few days is reading books, but even with that, I have to take a break every half hour or else I zone out.

Do you guys have any advice for me? I have nothing to be sad about, my life is great as it is, but at the same time I don't feel happy about anything. I usually feel comfortable with my friends, but we've been talking less and less recently, due to conflicting schedules at school.

She said that she declined all of these advances and I don't have any reason to doubt her, but what bothers me the most is that the she let the guy who tried to kiss her sleep on her couch.

She says she's only interested in me and that she found those guys, desperate and creepy, but it bothers me that she didn't see it to begin with and that she didn't just flat out kick them out of her apartment. Is she just overly flirty/nice. Is this a red flag?

I already have trust issues and the LDR thing is compounding them. I'd love to have an honest discussion about it, but don't want to seem controlling or overly jealous.

TL;DR:","  Just started a new relationship with a girl, but she let a creepy guy who tried to kiss her sleep on her couch. Is she just overly flirty or is there something fishy going on?",  new relationship and possible red flags. Neighbors came on to her and her friend and even though she said she denied their advances if bothers me that she let it get as far as it did.

TITLE: Feeling discouraged and a little lost - Need some advice.

POST: I'm sure these types of posts crop of from time to time, so I apologize if you've seen this all before.

I'm looking for a little advice.  To begin, I'll give you some background information.  I graduated in 2002 and joined the Air Force.  While I was in, I worked on Radar Jamming Pods and their Test Stations.  I was young and it was my first time away from home, so I didn't pursue my Associates like I should have.  I was Honorably Discharged in 2006 and I moved back home.

January 2007, I enrolled in the local community college and started an AAS in Biotechnology.  I gave up on that, changed my major, and instead, graduated with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technologies in May 2010.  I looked for work in my field, but ended up as a Shipping Supervisor for a bakery in October 2010.  I'm still here.

What I'm looking for is direction...I want to work in a field relating to computers.  I've put off getting any Comptia Certs, because I don't know if they're worth the effort / money.  I just withdrew from CTU's Online program, due to time constraints and a lack of instruction from the courses I was taking.  I did take a Web Design course during my time there and I enjoyed it.

Should I try and obtain a second AAS?  A Bachelor's degree program is likely out of my reach, due to work and money.

I'm including my resume for any pointers you may have.

Thanks in advance; sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR:","  Graduated in 2002, joined the Air Force, worked on radar jamming pods, graduated with an associates degree in electronics engineering technologies, looking for direction in a career related to computers.

TITLE: Reddit, when I was young I was tested for my IQ and I was told it was in the upper 140s. Nowadays, I don't feel as smart. Is video games really killing my intelligence?

POST: When I was young- 1st grade, maybe even before, I was tested for my IQ. I remember how my parents used to be so proud to tell me that the doctor said I had a higher IQ than even his. I don't remember the exact number but I know it was in the upper 140s, likely 146. During most of grade school, I felt as if I was that intelligent. However, during my final year at high school and my years so far in college, I haven't felt so smart. My mind feels sluggish at times and it doesn't seem to react with the same speed it used to. It's like a hazy feeling that I should be able to think through a problem that's giving me issues and it takes a lot more effort than I'm used to. I don't know what to think of this but I try to brush it off as simply being out of practice with the subjects I'm thinking about. I don't know if this is really it though. I don't do many harmful activities- I only drink sparingly and I don't do drugs. I exercise daily and eat healthily. The only thing I really do is play a very very large amount of video games and be on my computer for hours. I saw a comment on another thread and it made me think about this again. So, what is my problem? Is there anything I can do to regain my sharpness and should I start cutting out my excessive hours of video games?

TITLE: Getting a new job where I need to incorporate (S Corp) and am lost when it comes to taxes and salaries (and dividends, oh my!)

POST: Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm going to be starting a new job soon at 130k a year, with a rather special circumstance. As part of the terms of me being hired, I need to set up a S Corp, and essentially be business to business in terms of the relationship with the company.

I know it sounds super sketchy for a company to require me to do that, but it makes sense in context. I am 20 years old, and HR would never green light 130k for a 20 year old dude, so this is the solution that was proposed.

I understand that I take on more taxes because of me being self employed (the other half of the taxes normally paid by the employer), but I am lost as to how to count anything. I should be paying myself a salary, and then paying the rest through dividends correct? Are there any sort of step by step guides on how to do this correctly?

Also, is there a way (short of sitting down with a CPA) to calculate my take home pay when counting dividends and federal/state/local taxes? I looked online at tax calculators, and they either seem too simple, or vary wildly. Some say that I would owe 10k total per year (seems too low) and some say that I would owe 50k total per year (seems wayyy to high).

Furthermore (sorry for the wall of text), I'd like to setup some sort of retirement account (or accounts), but since I will be self employed I'm not sure what avenue to take.

I have contacted a CPA in the area to setup an appointment to get incorporated, but was looking for some advice from more voices on the questions above. Thanks!

TITLE: I[19F] believe I am bi-sexual, should I come out? Identified to bf[20M], and I don't know how to proceed. [x-post from /r/sex]

POST: Well. I will start off by saying that I told my SO that I thought I was bi-sexual today, and he seemed to treat it as water off a duck's back. I was thoroughly surprised since he is a little jealous sometimes when it comes to other men, but I guess he could just call it ""hot"" if he really isn't taking me seriously.

Anyways, that's not the point, I was always a little curious, but never acted upon the fantasies I had. I always would think of women giving me oral, or I always thought that breasts were so nice, and kind of got turned on by them.

Here is where things get a little complicated. I do believe I am bi-sexual, but never got the chance to act on it. Once when I was in high school me and one of my closest friends got drunkenly dared to kiss each other, and we did. What would she think if I came out as bi? And my best friend is gay, we never did anything, but would this complicate the relationship? I'm pretty scared to tell people- should I?

Also, some parts of my family aren't that accepting of non-heterosexual relationships, so if I came out, should I just keep it to my close circle of friends?

How would I go about it?

I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:","  I believe I am bi-sexual, never acted upon it, and am scared to tell people. Should I come out to my SO and risk jeopardizing our relationship? How should I go about it?","  I think I'm bi, and although my boyfriend doesn't care, I'm afraid my friends will because of history."

TITLE: Would you consider it unhealthy to hate people?

POST: It's not like I'm talking about going around and murdering random people, but I don't have very many nice things to say about them.

I think they are pieces of trash that are led by personal and selfish desires and if deemed necessary Would not hesitate to kill a motherfucker. So maybe I sort of lied about the murdering thing, but I really don't believe that people are worth keeping around. We sit around and manipulate each other until we get what we want. I see most people as mindless animals that are just taking up space and fucking each other so that they can produce more mindless garbage. It just sickens me to see and hear what people do to others.

I mean sure there are the people who actually go out of their way to make a difference and try their best to be good people but I feel like those people are so few and far apart. I believe that all people have the potential to be amazing, but I also believe that people have the potential to be horrible monsters, and I think that most people go in the bad direction.

I don't know, maybe I am just some dumb high-schooler (17 years old in case you were wondering) who is too stupid to see that people aren't shitty. Maybe you people can show me the way. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to not hate people?

TL;DR:",  I think most people are basically worthless pieces of shit who manipulate others until they get what they want. Would you consider it unhealthy to hate people?,  I absolutely hate people. Is this view unhealthy and if so is there something you can say that might change my mind?

TITLE: My (16F) boyfriend (16M) hasn't gotten me a gift yet... our anniversary was a little over two weeks ago.

POST: I don't know whether my being upset is valid or not, and I'd like some insight.

Our 2 year anniversary was July 20th and I got him a cologne, a little bag of the candies he likes, and a new CD, along with a few more personal items. He has yet to get me anything, although we've made a plan on what he will get me. Our plan was to go to sephora together and he'd buy me $30 worth of products.

It sounded perfect to me. But we start to make plans before he gets his paycheck, and he always says he will have X amount left over for gas and my present. Yet every time he gets paid he doesn't have the money. He always says he is going to ask to borrow it from his parents/keep it from his paycheck but something always comes up and he can't take me. This has happened at least 3 times already. Honestly I've lost excitement in going because I feel like it's never going to happen.

I can't bring it up to him because whenever I do he gets really upset and apologizes a lot, which I appreciate, but I just would rather him say that he can't take me (if that's the case) rather than continue to drag this out.

I feel bad for being upset, because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck. But it doesn't change the fact that he's been promising and not coming through, which is upsetting. 

I need an outsider's opinion so I can have some unbiased opinions to look through.

TL;DR:","  Boyfriend hasn't gotten me a gift for our 2 year anniversary, has promised but hasn't followed through. I feel bad for being upset because he's 16 on a 16 year old's paycheck.","  Boyfriend planned to take me for anniversary present, hasn't, and is now a little over 2 weeks late with it."

TITLE: My fitness pal help needed.

POST: I have just started a journey to a new an healthier me as I realised that turning 25 being 236lbs at 5'9"" was not a good way to end a year. 
I have been cooking healthier meals and working out almost daily for 25-35 mins of cardio, and I recently started using fitbit and MFP together. 
I am as honest as I can be without kitchen scales (which I am buying this weekend) about the weight of all the foods and therefore the calories that I am eating but I find that MFP is nagging at me to eat more. 
Today I have cooked a HUUUGE meal for lunchtime that I think would serve about three people. Lots of fresh veg, a bit of skinless chicken and some quiona, when I put the amount of food into MFP it tells me the calories are too low and I am putting my body into starvation mode, I am not sure I will be able to eat even half of this meal, but I am worried that if I don't eat more my body won't be able to repair itself.
On an average day I will eat about 1200 calories, consisting of porridge & honey for breakfast, lunch of a meat, veg and quinoa/couscous and dinner of fresh veg, meat and sometimes potatoes. 
I don't often find myself hungry and I drink about 2-3l of water a day, if I have less I get a massive headache from the central heating system. So I was wondering if anyone else finds MFP nagging at them to eat more calories. Even on the meals that I cheat with and have a pizza MFP is still telling me I am under my calorie limit although those days are the only days it doesn't nag me about starvation mode.

TL;DR:","  Starting a journey to a healthier me, using fitbit and MFP together, MFP is nagging me to eat more calories even on meals I cheat with. Anyone else experience this?","  MFP nags me to eat more calories, but I don't think I can whilst remaining in my healthy diet. Help?"

TITLE: NSV, I now take a bike and the stairs to work.

POST: As far as my weight goes, the short story is that I somehow got to be over 260 pounds at 5'9""-ish, and then lost about 80 pounds. That was a few years ago. I was in damn good shape. Could run, was thinking about joining the armed forces. Everything was awesome...

A few years later, and I fell off. I turn 24 next week, and I was recently juuuuust over 300 pounds. I live almost exactly 100 miles north of New York City. Last semester IU started commuting to the city for work and school. I still live up north, because I have another job up there. Train tickets got expensive, so I saved money by biking instead of taking the subway.

I only just started eating healthier a couple weeks ago, but I'm down about 10-15 pounds right now. Just hit 286, and I'm very happy. I know it isn't really progress, but it's nice to know that it's all improvement from here. I've done it before, and I can do it again. I know I won't let myself fall off.

So the first few times I took a bike a few miles from Grand Central Terminal to my job, only a few miles, I was so tired the next day. Mostly just my legs (Coat + Backpack didnt help >.<). Anyway, it has been getting easier, and I think now that it's warm I'll take up some weekend leisure rides. :)

Also, about 20 minutes ago, I took the elevator down to street level to go buy some food, and realized I forgot my wallet, which means I forgot my elevator key. I could have asked the door man, but instead just took the stairs 21 floors up. I was almost out of breath at the top, and I'm sure I will get muscle cramps tomorrow, but it was so worth it. :)

TL;DR:","  Lost 80 pounds, started eating healthier, started biking to work, forgot wallet, took the stairs instead of the elevator. Feeling much better about my progress.","  I bike a few miles to work now, and finally took the stairs 21 flights up. Mostly just an ""I'm excited"" kinda post."

TITLE: I'm going there: I cannot bring myself to finish LOTR.

POST: **Notice: I mean no disrespect to fans so please don't take this the wrong way.**

...but I'm more than open to having my mind changed if someone can explain to me what I'm missing.

My job has an hour-long commute, so I joined the library and have been going through podcasts and audiobooks like crazy. 

While sifting through their audiobook collection I saw they had all of the LOTR books, which I've never read -- I wanted to as a teenager but never got around to it. I never watched the movies because I wanted to read the books first because I'm a nerd like that. I knew absolutely nothing about the series other than the brief introduction I had to it while playing the Interplay LOTR adventure game on PC in the mid-90's for half an hour once.

So for the first few discs I found it a little monotonous. Lots of awkward singing by the narrator, lots of painfully long descriptions of the Shire and lots of genealogy for minor characters, which I found odd. But I assumed it'd pick up since I had 14 discs left to go.

I'm currently on disc 9 (right as they're getting to Rivendell) but I absolutely cannot get interested in it, though not for lack of trying. Each commute it gets more difficult for me to keep listening rather than just throw on music or the news. Every time I get to a new disc I feel like I just finished several hours of homework and I have to bargain with myself to start the next one. 

It's not that I don't like it. I like Tolkien's style, the characters are ridiculously well-developed and I can appreciate how groundbreaking it was in the 1950's...I just can't figure out what's so interesting and exciting about it to so many people, and I certainly can't imagine spending 50+ more hours finishing out the entire trilogy. 

Can someone change my mind before I bail and take it back to the library on Tuesday? 

If it matters in your analysis, my normal taste is Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, David Sedaris and non-fiction about science, politics and religion. My favorite book is Good Omens by Gaiman/Pratchett.

TL;DR:",  I can't bring myself to finish LOTR. I love the style and characters but can't figure out what's so interesting about it to so many people. Can someone change my mind before I bail?,  Can't get into Lord of the Rings but I'm open to giving it another shot if someone can tell me why I should.

He thinks it would make the most sense to move in together and has also mentioned getting engaged but not getting married for a while. I don't want to get engaged or married until my late 20s (that's always been my plan). I also side with my traditional mom and grandma who do not think moving in together is okay until we are at least planning a wedding. 

I can totally see myself marrying him if we are still together in several years. But I can also see things coming between us. I'm dead set on living in another country, and I might actually have to spend six months in another country within the next couple of years. He has always mentioned that he wants to stay in the town we live in now. I am also very chronically sick (nothing terminal, but sometimes debilitating) and he doesn't handle that very well when I'm going through a flare. 

I definitely love him with my whole heart and everyone thinks we're perfect together, but I'm still hesitant. How do I tell him I don't want to move in together and get engaged yet without hurting his feelings and making him think I don't love him?

TITLE: I [M/18] think my stepmother [F/44] is overstepping her boundaries

POST: For the past couple of years my father [M/52] has been married to my stepmother [F/44] and I [M/18] think she is overstepping boundaries and is taking advantage of my father in many situations.

Now, first of all, she isn't some horrible step mother, but she isn't great either. She doesn't have any kids of her own so she tries to punish me as if I was her kid, which my father allows. This would honestly not be a big deal, if she seemed sane...

She nitpicks at everything I do one week, and then loves me the next. The littlest thing can trigger her, such as what happened tonight.

I ran out of batteries in my remote, so I replaced them with the batteries in my dad's remote, which were in his bedroom. I do this a lot, and then hide the used batteries somewhere obvious so he puts them in and then the remote still doesn't work.

Nothing happened for a while, so I assumed they just replaced the batteries, so I fell asleep. I was awakened to screaming and yelling and slamming of the opening of my door. My stepmother was yelling about how 'going into their room was an invasion of privacy'... I would understand that if the door was locked... Or closed... Or not wide open... Or if I was never allowed to go in there before... But, no. It had never been an issue before. She now told me that she doesn't trust me, and doesn't think she will be able to sleep in the same house as me...

She walked out, still yelling and shouting, and I told my father that I think it is essentially bullshit what she is doing, but all he does is nod and agree with her and say 'I need to stay on the same page as her. That's what a marriage is.'

POST: This happened a few months ago...

I'm a grad student, so I work most weekends. This is important later. Over the summer, I had made it a habit of going poo in the second floor bathroom. It's a single toilet and the best in the building. Knowing I could easily clog my home toilet during my healthy eating binge and having heard from my male friends of the industrial flushing power of the campus toilets, I decided to make using this toilet my routine.

Until the fuck up. This one particular poo did not fit nor ship, thus rendering the toilet useless. It was a Friday afternoon, and the cleaning crew doesn't come in on the weekends. And Monday was a holiday. Ugh. Oh well, I thought. I still had the men's room. Weekends weren't busy, so I wasn't concerned.

Saturday comes around and I use the men's bathroom as a backup. It didn't fit nor ship on Saturday, either. After that, I had to walk to the opposite side of the building and down a floor to use the bathroom until Thursday because they had to call a professional plumber...

I am running on a treadmill since I already have a gym membership so I can measure exactly how much faster I am going. I went from day 1 at 6.5 miles per hour to Day 2 at 6.7mph and then today all my run intervals were at 7mph. Even though each workout is the same, I found that this keeps it challenging instead of resorting back to the idea that its something I've already achieved.

So here's the unintended part: I have noticed that with my continued success in losing weight, dieting properly, and keeping to my exercise goals that my confidence in myself is going up. I know that is to be expected but its also effecting my ability to be better in other areas of my life that I never could stick with like my hygiene, my schedule, my budget, keeping in touch with people, etc etc. It's like seeing that when I am determined to do something I can achieve is pushing me to reassess those other things and know that I can improve them too. I get more enjoyment out of striving to be an all around better adult and improving myself now so I have seen much more improvement in all aspects of my life. It's a great feeling as there things have been nagging me for years.

TITLE: TIFU by starting an oil fire in my kitchen

POST: This fuck up happened a couple years ago before I knew of reddit and now I feel compelled to share it. 

So it was new years eve and my husband and I didn't have much food in the house. So I decided to make some homemade potato chips to munch on while we watched a movie. I used a pot and heated up some oil. The chips turned out okay I can never seem to cut them thin enough. I turned off the stove and returned to the couch to watch our movie. 

So the kitchen in my apartment was hiding behind a corner, so there was no way we could have noticed the flames any sooner. 

I see a ominous orange glow coming from the kitchen so I casually walk over and turn the corner and...
OH SHIT! FIRE! FIRE!

I literally panic like an idiot. And thank goodness my husband was there to take care of the situation otherwise I would have surely burnt down the apartment. Turns out I hadn't turned off the burner, but had left it on the highest setting.

So my husband bolts into the kitchen and grabs the  pot of oil that has ignited. With some quick thinking he grabs a nearby pan and attempts to smother the flames whilst running out of the kitchen towards the door. I open the door and finally in the breezeway of the apartment complex my husband tames the fire.

There was black soot coated on the vent hood of the stove and my pan was destroyed. I am just glad I didn't start the new year by burning down the apartment.

TL;DR:","  Was making homemade potato chips, left burner on the highest setting, oil caught fire, husband rushed in to smother the flames, pan was destroyed.",  Nearly burned down the apartment on new years eve because I left a pot of oil on the burner and when I thought I turned it off it was actually on the highest setting.

TITLE: What can i do about an abusive owner?(I work in a restaurant with illegal employees)

POST: Like any other restaurant there is a lot of crazy shit that goes on semi-regularly. The owner is an italian immigrant, who has little respect for his employees. Last year he got arrested for beating up one of our 17 yo bussers. He will pretty much do anything he can get away with. All of our kitchen and now bussers are illegal immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador. These dudes are the hardest working chillest bros out there. Favorite people in the restaurant by far. I've even learned semi-fluent spanish from them. My biggest deterrent to reporting my boss for an array of abusive actions, is my concern all my buddies will get deported or something. The servers tip out the bussers every night yet the bussers never see this money. When i confronted the manager she informed me it was used to pay their hourly wage. Our carry-out guy gets tips from time to time directly from the customer. I learned today that he has to give those tips to the owner and the credit card tips are just ignored by him. They tried to tell me the same thing when i covered for the carry out guy this morning. I confronted them then, and was told i could talk about it later when the carry out guy wasn't around. I dont know what to do. Can i report the management or owner with out my foreign buddies getting in trouble.

TL;DR:",  I work in a restaurant with illegal immigrants. Owner abuses his employees. Tips are ignored by the owner and carry out guy. What can i do to report the owner without my foreign buddies getting in trouble?,  I believe i have enough to report my employer for an array of abuses. Can i do this without having some of my illegal immigrent co-workers get the shaft?

TITLE: Living with Negativity....26M

POST: Alright so here is the quick and dirty
Me - 26 M
Her - 32 F
Married 2 years this July.
Together 5 years this October.

When we first moved in together I had alot of things that I had to work on as far as being a better husband and communicating with her better, doing my part around the house etc.  Each time it was brought up it devolved into fighting but we figured that this wasn't working so devised a solution, a list!

This worked, my behaviours changed for the betterment of the relationship and myself and I feel like a better person for it.

Now me, I am a generally positive individual, I try my best to maintain a relatively positive outlook on things and just be humorous.  When it comes to serious stuff I am serious but otherwise I love to smile!

The issue I am having now is that we have been having ongoing discussions for the past 6 or so months about her attitude which has been getting progressively worse.  She is employed, currently paying down her student loans and stuck with a job that she hates while she does so.  Understandably not the best situation but I am always here for her and to support her, I've helped her get her food blog started, helped her get the implements for her baking etc.  

Instead of a happier more positive wife I have someone who constantly looks at the negatives, refuses to discuss our future together because it is depressing and just in general has issues showing emotion.

We have discussed this time and again, I'm getting sick of it, she is too and I'm just not seeing much improvement.

I love her, I care for her but for my own mental health I am having difficulty wanting to actually spend time with her when it feels like she just hates life.

Kind of a can't see the forest through the trees kind of thing.

I'm open to any suggestions Reddit may have on this.

TL;DR:","  Living with negativity from my wife, she is stuck with a shitty job and is unhappy.  Constant negativity is affecting our relationship and I'm sick of it.

Ive came unannounced before and spent the night numerous times before, I know where she hides her spare key. So its like 2am and homegirl fell asleep watching tv the couch(where I usually crash when I come over.) So I crash on her bed. Heres where the FU happens. She woke up middle of the night to get water and moved to her bed without noticing me. Both of us are asleep in the same bed and I spooned her. She then freaks out and grabs a lamp and attacks me with it. She got on top of me and threw a few more swings, I was yelling ""STOP STOP STOP"" but she kept on going at me. She then realizes it was me and stops. She patched me up, we had some cocoa, laughed about the whole situation and she went on to fix the bed before going back to sleep. Now here I am buzzed telling the people of reddit how I got beat up by a girl. Happy holidays everyone!

TITLE: Our kitty is so picky, we've given in.

POST: Our rescue cat, Abby, has always been picky with food. When we first got her, she was quite ill and didn't like to eat anyway so that was even more difficult. Every time we think she likes a food, she stops eating it within a week and won't eat it again (Only after we have bought a months supply...).  

The thing is, we've tried to out-stubborn the cat, and it was a game of chicken we were never going to win.  And then came kitty number two, Ollie, who is just the jabba the hutt of kitties.

Not only will Ollie eat any left over food in Abby's bowl, but Abby doesn't want it and actively gives it to her baby sister.  It got so bad that Abby was vomiting clear bile out of hunger at night... we tried separating them, getting new foods, giving dry food to snack on... it was no use, she didn't eat. Before anyone asks, she HAS been to the vet and they just said she's picky.

Fast forward to us getting a gift pack from our vet for the baby when we took Abby in to see if there is a problem. It has royal canin weaning kitty food, and we thought we'd see if Ollie liked it. Guess who likes it? Abby. It is kitty crack cocaine I don't know. We started sprinkling it on top of normal cat food, and guess what.. she eats it. It's like a seasoning.

So here is our doubt, is this ok to do? The vet seemed really passive about it, and I don't know how good this is to do. I looked up its ingredients and it almost seems just like a vitamin packed dry food. We are sprinkling so she doesn't eat more than a a few grams.

TL;DR:","  Our rescue cat is extremely picky with food, we've tried all the usual things and nothing works. We've given in and are sprinkling Royal Canin kitten food on top of normal cat food.","  our rescue cat won the food battle and now we give her weaning kitten food to get her to eat normally, is this ok?"

TITLE: Had a great date with a guy [26M] that I [23F] met online, and then out of the blue he goes completely no contact two days later. Do I reach out for closure?

POST: I have been texting and snapchatting a guy I met on OKCupid for 2 weeks before we decided to meet and go on our first date. 

When we met, we clicked. Our sense of humor aligned, we both have the same views on religion and politics, and never ran out of things to talk about over the course of the day. (We went hiking and picnicking, so we were together for about 7 hours on a Saturday.) At the end of the night, there was a perfect first kiss, then some making out later, and talks of a ""next time.""

We texted back and forth a little on Sunday, and then Monday I get radio silence. He finally texts me back these one word answers, and then eventually just stops responding. I check on Facebook to see if there's anything going on (as he's a fairly active user and uses Facebook a little like Twitter) only to find out I've been unfriended. 

That was two days ago, and I'm afraid I've been a mess ever since (I know it's silly to get attached that quickly, but we had in depth conversations over the course of two weeks and I've always worn my heart on my sleeve anyway.) I know it's over, I just have no idea why. He gave me no indication that anything was wrong, and if going on that date with me was just acting then he deserves an Oscar. 

Do I reach out to him again for closure? I don't want to be the clingy girl that can't take a hint, but I'm kind of heartbroken that I don't at least know WHY.

TITLE: My [37M] ex-wife [36F] started dating someone that doesn't want her seeing me. To respect his wishes, she has cut off contact and I can't see my stepson [15M] that I've known for nine years.

POST: My ex-wife and I have known each other for nine years. For those nine years I have also had the wonderful opportunity of building a father/son relationship with my stepson.  My son's mother was/is the best friend I've ever had. Sometimes relationships have their issues so we divorced. We have stayed friends and have been able to be a part of their lives. 

Around the end of June and beginning of July she started to date someone seriously.  All I wanted for her was to be happy, which she was. At the end of July she told me she needed to speak with me. We met for lunch and the first words out of her mouth were, ""You're going to hate me."" At that point she told me her new boyfriend didn't want her seeing me, but that it was her choice. She then told me I wouldn't be able to see my son, who I would see at least once a week to hang out, work on homework, or use the season tickets we had to one of the local sports teams.  Afterwards, she told me she would re-evaluate the situation in four months and that I would be able to see my stepson one more time to speak with him (under the supervision of his aunt). After the meeting she blocked me on all social media and had my son do the same.

I was devastated because I had lost two of my best friends. 
The last 16 weeks have been some of the most difficult I've ever faced. I contacted my son's aunt and she told me her sister hadn't told her anything about the agreement of seeing my son and that she didn't want to get involved. I'm fine with that, I don't want to cause any rifts with her family. 

This Monday will be the end of four months. I have some ideas on how I should approach the situation but I would like anyone's opinion on how to proceed.

POST: I'm 22m and my girlfriend 22f have an apartment together. We have a rent, phone bills etc. Both of us work full time to pay our bills. The problem is my girlfriend has been paying her little sisters bill as well as her own and we never have any extra money. We can't go to a dinner or movie at the end of the month because we have bills and food. Her parents are not the best off but they make at least 5 times as much as we do. They have pot (which I have no problem with ) and do other recreational activities. Her little sister is 13. 

I understand a cellphone is necessary with buses and stuff but why is my gf fronting the bill. She refused to bring it up to either of them and I've talked to other people in her family and their on my side.  I keep telling her to please bring it up to them. I didn't mind before we had all these bills but now that we're trying to start a life every penny counts.  I don't want to bring it up to her parents because I'm not exactly in the position too but this is effecting our bills. Not to mention I want her to be on my significantly cheaper service provider. 

Her mom also does little things like say she's coming over then shows up her, her boyfriend, his son and his sons friend. We have a tiny one bedroom and this ruined my night because I couldn't even sit on my couch and relax after work. She's also told her little sister Her and her friends could stay at our house while they attended a con which we could not house or feed. (They didn't enzd up staying but it's the principal) My girlfriends sister is family but I don't think it's her/our responsibility to care for her. The main issue though is the phone bill. What should I do guys?

 I decided to let my friend move in with me as long as he pays 150 dollars a month to me for rent. Today I just asked him if I could get the money early because I need gas and to get some other stuff. He basically told me that I use him as an atm. I don't understand this. We agree'd to a certain amount. I told him that I hope he didn't see it that way, because I don't see him that way at all. He has lended me 15 bucks for a leash for my dog a while back and I told him he could take it off of rent, but that's the only time I have asked for any sort of early rent from him or any sort of money beyond the agree'd 150.

POST: So I'll be filing my won taxes for the first time, and I'm a little confused because of the way I make money. I work online and get paid with either btc or paypal. When I get paid with bitcoin, I sell in on localbitcoins for either cash or gold/silver bullion. I've had some issues with paypal before, and because of this I don't add all my personal/banking info. Each week I use the money on paypal to purchase around $3500 of gold/silver bullion from ebay. All of which I keep in a safe. I have money in my checking/savings account that I use for bills/expenses, so all the money I have made this year is in gold/silver. I know this seems really silly or might be a stupid thing to do with my money, but collecting gold and silver is a hobby of mine and I've just been stocking up.

Is there something I should do if I don't know how much I have made, and don't have a W2 or any tax info? Do I mark down that I'm self employed?

TITLE: I am a fucking dumbass who can't read numbers

POST: I mixed up two of the digits when I sent the text message.

I am in a student organization that helps build primary and secondary schools in rural areas in Honduras. I went on a week long service trip last winter and it was the most amazing week of my life. I can't describe why, but being in this organization and working towards my fundraising goal has been just about the most important and fulfilling thing in my life over the last year or so.

I was supposed to head back to Honduras in 5 days. For now I am home from college over winter break. I noticed last week that I made the colossal mistake of leaving my passport at my college apartment (~5 hrs away). Thankfully, I had a roommate still there who could mail it to me. With over 10 business days before leaving on my trip at the time, I figured mailing it was not much of a risk (I realize now how stupid this reasoning is).

Of course, today, I checked back over my text conversation with my roommate and noticed I got the fucking address wrong. 2 numbers swapped places. I don't know if I read it wrong or typed it in wrong. The address I sent does not exist. I am a fucking aerospace engineering student but I can't fucking read a fucking 5 digit number apparently. 

I am lost for options at this point. It will be near impossible to track it down (it's in an envelope, no tracking #). It will most certainly be returned to my college apartment too late to get in time for my flight.

I realize that this only happened because of a special series of idiotic errors that only I am capable of. I have wasted a years worth of fundraising, over a thousand dollars worth. I spent so many mornings at bake sales and sponsored events. I worked so hard and now I will spend the week at home feeling sorry for myself. I want to crawl under a rock and die.

TITLE: How do I [21F] break up with my BF [21M] of two years? First relationship.

POST: It's over. 

It hurts to admit it, but it's true. We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. 

There's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). 

It's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. 

What do I say? I don't want to hurt him. I've been putting this off because I don't want to have to go through the stress of one of us moving out or explaining to his parents (who treat me like a daughter). How do I even bring it up? I have never done this before and I don't know how. 

Also- my biggest fear- will I regret it?

TITLE: I need some advice about a few things

POST: The whole starting point of everything happened when my dad walked out on my mum after cheating. It's been an extremely messy and complicated divorce that is still not settled 4 years later. My dad has depression and has some perceived victim complex when talking about the divorce to people - to some he will lie and act as if they are still together (he didn't even tell his own family, they found out by trying to contact him through us). To others he says how my mum is the one who cheated - but HE is the one who cheated. He has also been keeping secrets and lying for many years before he left. He has lied constantly throughout the court process and won't agree to settle anything because he wants to destroy my mum - even the mediator says his behaviour is absolutely fucked and can't understand why he won't just settle things. That is only some of it - but I don't speak to him at all anymore. He hasn't supported me one bit throughout this entire process or even tried to.

A knock on effect is that now my mum and sibling have depression as well. All 3 of my immediate family have depression and I do not.  It is very difficult to live with her sometimes and I don't know what to do.

Due to all of this my mum is now trying to support me and the pets we have (sibling moved out of home)singlehandedly but money is extremely  tight all of the time. Due to me being over 18, my dad is not legally required to help me at all... It creates a lot of stress and I did have a job but lost it due to no hours for me. Now I have zero income. I am trying to get through uni - 4/5 days a week 1h30mins away, and do 5:30 starts most mornings leaving me somewhat sleep deprived.

I was a wreck for months). Then my new ex (Mike) comes along, and kinda lifts me back out from my depression-esque mentality. So we're both attracted to each other, but I was scared to date Mike because I didn't think I could go through anotehr breakup. But after a while, I finally relented cuz I couldn't bear to see him with other people, and he kinda said, ""If we break up, I'll make you hate me or something so it'll hurt less."" Either way, we got together, but I was a bit clingy and needed a lot of his time, so he said he couldn't deal with it. Broke up with me gently, and said we could stay friends (we were pretty good friends in that period where he was helping me get over John). Now I want to be friends again, but I feel like I'm trying too hard. Also I still like him, and it's only been... about exactly a week.

I'll ask her out and get turned down because her parents won't let her, she has work, she has uni or she's with other friends, to the point where I've stopped trying.

Part of the issue is me, because I'm too spiteful and refuse to be the one always asking. I asked two friends out to lunch today and just didn't bother asking my own girlfriend, simply because there was like an 80% chance she'd say no for whatever reason and I'd get pissed off.

I tried to break up with her a few months ago for the same reason, really, and I've had words with her about it since too. I know she cares, I know that I mean a lot to her and she doesn't want to lose me...but she just doesn't show it at all [when she's not with me]. When we're together everything is really good, great even. We have heaps of fun and clearly love each other's company. But once we part ways, it might be for the whole week despite us living like a 20 minute drive away, and 90% of the time we'll only see each other if I keep asking.

I've had this issue for a while but have told myself I'll wait until the end of August since by then we'll have had a few weeks with her parents out of the picture to see if the relationship actually changes, but I don't know if I can even hang in that much longer. I asked her to come over on Thursday since I hadn't seen her for a week and had been away - she was going to be at work that night and my place is closer than hers from there - but no, she was ""too tired"" to stay with me.

Since I've brought it up before and nothing's really changed, should I even go through the same speech again? I want to love this girl but I just spend so much of my time being pissed off.

Yesterday he initiated the conversation again and started telling me about this woman at work who wanted to set him him up with someone. I asked him if she showed him pictures of the woman in question. He replied: ""Yes, she looks terrible. **I lied** and said I just started seeing someone.""

I am very upset because of the ""I lied"" part of the sentence but didn't tell him anything about it yet. He didn't seem to be joking at all.

Also, I think it's worth mentioning that our first date was outside and awesome and lasted six hours but that the dates after were mostly dinner at his place.

Do you believe he is seeing me as a fuck buddy and thinks I'm cool with it, or is there any chance that he is testing the waters to see how I am going to be reacting to his behavior?

POST: So I just got stood up. 

Here's the deal. I've been seeing this guy for about 5 weeks now and we've really been hitting it off. So far everything has been really good, no problems, and we planned last night to meet up for lunch during my 12-1 break today. We texted and had unrelated conversation this morning, then at 12 I left class to go meet him. 

By 12:15 he's a no-show, so I text to make sure everything is ok. 

By 12:30 I'm pretty pissed off, and a friend passes by so I accompany him to lunch and text the guy id been planning to meet that I had to leave to get food since I had class at 1.  He responds about 10 minutes later with something along the lines of ""sorry, I'm awful, I got caught up in schoolwork and lost track of time"". I haven't said anything yet. 

I'm pretty angry, and those who know me in person know that I never get angry about anything. I don't know what to do. I really liked him and things had been going really well. If it wasn't for that I would have no trouble just not responding and never seeing him again, but I do really like him. What do I do/say?

TITLE: TIFU by being weirdly obsessed with coin orientation

POST: I was about 10 and my friend and I saw a cool infomercial (no idea now what they were selling) where a guy flattened a penny with a hammer. (If you think you know where this is going, you are absolutely right.) For some reason, we thought it would be a great idea to try that, only we couldn't find a penny, so we decided to try to flatten a dime. Shockingly, dimes and pennies are made of different materials, so we weren't making much progress, but like good little elementary school kids, we were taking turns swinging the hammer on the sidewalk by my house. When it was my friend's turn, I noticed Roosevelt's face was angled about 40 degrees away from her, and for some reason it seemed really crucial that he be facing her dead on, so I rotated the dime. I was a neurotic, whiny kid, so when my mom heard me crying, she assumed it was something minor and came out rolling her eyes before she saw all the blood. Luckily, I didn't break any bones, but I had a cool hangnail with which to gross out all the boys on the bus for the next few weeks.

POST: The bank I go to has the cutest teller working inside during the afternoons, and I try to make up reasons to go just to see her. The problem is that when three tellers, or whatever, are working, no guarantee I'll get her window. I can't really just tell the person behind me, 'No no, you go ahead, I'm waiting for the cute one.' Anyway, We've talked a few times and flirted mildly. I was super-thrilled to see that she had a copy of an R.A Salvatore book - the fourth in the Drizzt series. So she's really pretty AND into geeky fantasy? I'm there!

So the question is, well two really, How to I find enough excuses to keep going back till I get her window? No guarantee she'll even be working that day anyway. And secondly, I feel kind of creepy hitting on a woman who's working. Like, she can't get away or whatever.

TITLE: Why aren't men interested in me? [f/20]

POST: Now, I don't really even know where to begin with this. I'm a 20 year old woman and I believe i'm a great person, but I just can figure out why men aren't interested in me unless they're just trying to hook up. I've had my fair share of hook ups, but never with someone i've just randomly met and i've continued to have good friendships with these men without having any desire to make a relationship out of it.

I am a full time student trying to get my degree, even doing that I have plenty of time to myself for other activities. I also am a mother. Sure I had my child young, but it's the one thing that changed my life for the better. I was not in school pre child and now my life has come together more than I ever could have hoped for. My child's father and I have a great friendship, and that's all it is. We co-parent very well together. Thus also leading me to have lots of time for myself as our time with our child is split 50/50.

I'd like to think that i'm a great person with a great personality. I enjoy pretty much anything and would be willing to experience new things. I've also always been told that i'm a very attractive woman. Now what am I missing here? I definitely don't need a man to make me happy, as I already am. I just know that i'd love to have that person who makes my life a little brighter.

Some of the men that i've been involved with recently (but not too recently) or interested in always seem to find a way out and I can't help but think it's either something to do with the fact that I already have a child or it's just something about me. I have my entire life in order. I live in my own home, no debt, I attend college and am very close to getting my degree. If  I can tell you one thing from that is that I have my life in FAR better order than most people my age and in my situation. Much better than most of my friends too.

So, any advice would help. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for, but it's something.

TITLE: What's the best way to get over being jealous of GF's Gay best friend?

POST: 22M, Girlfriend is 21F. We've been together for a year and a half. Her best friend is gay. At first I was uncomfortable with him since I don't know that many gay people, but the more I hung out with him (only a few times) the more comfortable I've been with him. We have complete trust in each other. Girlfriend actually went out with him when they were in high school together, then he cheated on her and then that's when he came out of the closet. They've remained best friends and like to go to gay clubs together. I feel this problem would be less of an issue if I went with them, but I work really late 5 days a week, (til 3am on weekends).

My only problem with him is how much he likes to drink which I feel like has an influence on her. I've brought that up to her but she says she will only keep drinking when she wants to. When she would instagram pictures of them together hanging at the club or wherever it made me feel uneasy. I felt it was unhealthy to feel that way and getting addicted to seeing what she would post so I stopped going on instagram completely. 

The reason why I get jealous is because I feel like she has more fun when it's just him and her vs me and her since he makes her laugh so much. Does anyone have any advice for learning to accept the idea that it's okay that maybe she does have fun with him more, since he is her best friend and all.. 

Re-reading what I wrote here, makes me feel like this whole thing is silly, but I still would like to hear what others have to say. Thanks.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband [40 M] of three years, weirded out by friendship with co-worker

POST: This is my second marriage, his first.  We have two kids.  For a couple of years, I've gotten a bad vibe from one of his female co-workers.  They are good friends, and get along really well.  They're both musicians.  He really likes her and wants to be able to hang out with her after work, like grabbing a beer with her.  I know he texts her sometimes outside of work hours but not sure how often or what about (he's pretty secretive with his phone).  It makes me super uncomfortable and he knows this. 

 We had a pretty big blowout a few months ago when she was throwing a party and I asked him not to go.  He thinks I'm totally irrational about her and gets angry whenever I try to talk to him about this.  He was going to go to the party regardless of how I felt about it so we ended up going together and it was fine.  

I have tried to just drop it since the party.  I feel like he knows how I feel and that's all I can really do.  He hasn't been going for drinks with her or anything, which I appreciate.   I have recently found out, though, that this woman has a reputation for being a ""home wrecker.""  My husband said it's because she went one a date with her married friend while he was separated from his wife.  This is making me feel even more uneasy about her and my husband's friendship.  I know rumor mills can get carried away, especially in a small town.  But I can't help but feel a little justified in wanting them to not be friends now that I know this.

More relevant information.... My first marriage ended because he met someone else.  So it's entirely possible I'm over reacting about this situation because of that.  I've been in therapy for over three years and feel like I've made great strides.  My husband occasionally goes to therapy with me but it hasn't been very helpful.  He gets impatient taking about the same thing over and over (his words).

TITLE: I [20 M] have been dating a girl [19 F] for about two weeks; her crazy ex has been threatening the both of us.

POST: I met a girl on Tinder for a casual hookup. There ended up being good chemistry between the two of us and we transitioned into dating. We've had five dates so far and everything has been quite well except for her abusive ex of 8 months getting involved. She had broken up with him about 4 months ago and I was her first venture back into the dating scene. As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.

Shortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number. The two times we've spoken he told me in a very threatening manner that he happens to have friends in various biker gangs and doesn't appreciate me seeing her. He then gave me an ultimatum to either stop seeing her OR to not set foot into ""his city"". I've only talked to him for 30 minutes or so; but I've come to the conclusion that he isn't the most mentally stable individual.

I'm not a fan of getting involved in situations like this; I tend to avoid conflicts because my time and effort is better spent doing more productive things. And because of my lack of experience dealing with threats and unstable individuals, I'm reaching out to you /r/relationships. She has told me that he has never followed through with any of his threats over the past few months of being broken up, but I feel as if him seeing her with a significant other might be enough to give him initiative to actually do something.

So, what would my best course of action be? I really do like this girl, and have a date in the city planned with her on Sunday. But on the other side of things I'd rather not put myself in a situation where I may be at risk.

TL;DR:",  Been dating a girl for two weeks. Her crazy ex has been threatening the both of us with violence and ultimatums.

POST: 30 year old male here about to break up with the girl I saw myself marrying.
So I have had issues trusting my gf, we have been together for 2.5 years now. in march of 2010 I caught her coming home (we have lived in my place together for entire relationship) and she was out drinking with an ex boyfriend. I sucked it up and accepted her apology and have been dealing with it ever since. This is about the time I registered her phone with the Find My Iphone service.
Fast forward to Monday night- I get texts form her saying she was going out to pick us up some food. I come home from work late around 7pm and she is not home. she wont answer my calls or texts. I know where she is cause I pulled up Find My Iphone website and she is at the local bar down the street. I wait for 3 hours and finally get a text of her saying she was at her girlfriends house and she will be home soon. LIAR! I had enough and stormed off to confront her at the bar. Didn't see the car she was driving in the parking lot so I'm starting to think im wrong, But there it is parked IN THE BACK. as if to hide from me.
I found her and a guy she works with (restaurant, typical for sleeping with coworkers).
Now we are a mess and Im about to throw her out and start my life over, Sucks cause I wanted to marry this one.
She doesn't know I tracked her with the iPhone. And I don't think Ill ever trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex? In my eyes she lied to be with another guy while i was at work and that's cheating in my book.
Any advice is appreciated.

There are two major problems though. The first is that I'm currently in Germany on a tour for another 4 months. So the next time I'll be able to see her and actually take her on the date will be when I come home for PCS leave(In the army). We talk every day Via Phone and Skype etc, which is nice even though I've known her for 7 years this is really the first time I have been able to see her personality for what it is, and it is amazing.

She says she brags about me all the time about how I'm Sweet and charming and thing of the like. What are your problems, success stories to help motivate me in that way. 

The second thing is as much as I like her, she has HSV-1. With the amount of research I've done on this topic I'm skeptical about it. I am clean. I just don't know what to do.

TITLE: [F29] Is there something in between casual sex and LTR?

POST: Three years ago I ended a 6 yr relationship, and it left me with a lot of trust issues. A few months after the split, my ex felt he needed to ""clear the air"" so that we could have a chance at reconciling. That involved my learning I had been completely oblivious to cheating, lying, and an arrest (yup, he went to jail for a few days and I had no idea). I know what you're thinking, that I am just super dumb. I wish that was the case, I'm college educated and have a professional career, just plain old gullible. In the aftermath, I have spent a year having exclusive relationships, the next having one night stands, and the last online dating. For the record online dating does nothing to improve trust issues, I had on guy tell me he slept with Cameron Diaz and another try to steal a set of golf clubs (and those are just the gems). 

This afternoon the guy I have been seeing on and off for the last six months finally agreed to keep things casual. Now, I am free to date and see whomever I choose, and am contemplating whether I want to go the online route again. My casual relationships thus far have involved ignoring lies because the details aren't important. This isn't one sided, I fib about where I am when I'm out with other guys. Unfortunately, when I notice them my history and fear makes ignoring feel self-deprecating, and I struggle to forgive myself for ages after the bad ones.  On the other hand, I am just not ready for the LTR I want, one missed text or phone call and I flip, but I'm not attracted to someone who caters to my every wish in the long term. So Reddit, I need suggestions on what to do next. 

- Side Note – During this last relationship I was in a place to tell my SO about how scared of lies I am and it got a lot better, so I know that in time it will get easier.

TITLE: Why would anyone want to call themselves a gamer? (Rant)

POST: I play video games; I have since I was a kid starting with Pokemon red. I still play them everyday, yet I refuse to call myself a gamer.

The way I see it, gaming has become more popular than ever. There are more people playing then ever before and subsequently more self-proclaimed gamers. However, since it has become so main stream, I don't see how it's much different than saying ""I'm a TV watcher"" or ""music listener."" Now if you said you only played tabletop or something, that'd be different.

The truth is that it isn't about being hardcore or even playing games. It's about wanting to be in a nerdy subculture that pretends it's niche when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Playing games is as mainstream as it gets.

No, it's about the culture that I think is frankly ridiculous. It's a bunch of nostalgia circlejerks and pseudo inside jokes for things that are actually quite popular (took an arrow to the knee, etc.) It doesn't matter if the latest call of duty (for example) is good or not, what matters is whether it's popular with ""gamers.""

""CoD is the same every time but the new Pokemon is pretty swell."" 

This hypocrisy and favoritism makes my blood boil. I've never played call of duty because it's not my cup of tea, not because ""that's what casuals play."" The whole PC master race also irritates me. Who really gives a shit what someones console preference is?

I can't even finish my rant. It frustrates me that I ever called myself a gamer as a kid anyway. It's just so dumb.

TL;DR:",  Why would anyone want to call themselves a gamer? It's become so popular that it's become meaningless. The culture is ridiculous and pretentious. I find it disgusting.

TITLE: Girl [25 F] with Male [28 M] can you go back to the getting to know phase once you have had sex?

POST: I wanted the internets opinion because my co-worker and I argued at length about this and got nowhere. 

So guy meets girl and they exchange numbers, talk and flirt all that jazz. They keep trying to organise a date but both are really busy. She suddenly decides to comes cover to guys house late one night, stays the night because he lives close to her work. They have sex.  

Now my question is can they go back to being a cute and trying to arrange a date and get to know each other or is she now a fuck buddy?

My view is she is now a fuck buddy. My co-worker says if he is really keen on her he will still take her out on a date because now he knows he will definitely get some.  I think he is just saying that just because.

TITLE: Do American kids have a ""dinosaur phase""?

POST: I'm from New Zealand. It's pretty much a secular country, ie politicians speaking about God is a big no-no. A lot of people are Christian but for the most part they are not fundamentalists, and most of them believe in evolution. Evolution is taught in science class in high school.

As a kid in New Zealand, pretty much every boy (and probably some girls) go through a ""dinosaur phase"", where they are really into dinosaurs. Their parents buy them dinosaur toys and book and computer games. The primary appeal is obviously the fact that dinosaurs are awesome giant scary monsters, but they also end up learning about the Cretaceous period and the Jurassic period and how many millions of years ago the dinosaurs lived.

So I read that [almost half of the American population doesn't believe in evolution] Coming from a scientific background, this just seems absolutely insane to me. Regardless of what you believe, the [body of evidence for evolution] is enormous enough that a person who denies it is denying fact and reason. But I don't want this is to turn into an evolution debate.

My question is, if a large portion of America doesn't believe in evolution, then do they still let their kids learn about dinosaurs? Do the kids still have a ""dinosaur phase""? I know Creationists have a few ways of [justifying dinosaurs without evolution] but it just seems to me that the topic of dinosaurs is something that most Creationist parents would want to sweep under the carpet. I don't know.

Caveat: I know things are different in different states and different communities. If you don't want to generalise, tell me about your specific upbringing.

TL;DR:","  Do large numbers of Americans not believe in evolution, do they still let their kids learn about dinosaurs? Do the kids still have a ""dinosaur phase""?",  many Americans don't believe in evolution. dinosaurs are closely linked to evolution and the age of the Earth. do American kids still have a dinosaur phase?

TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of one year, I can't figure out if we should stay together or not.

POST: So I have no doubt that I love my boyfriend. We've had a really tough first year. Lots of short break ups. I've been dealing with a new anxiety problem and its been tough on both of us. 

At one point we broke up long enough that I met someone very interesting, went on a date, had the best sex of my life. I remembered what it felt like to be lusted after or wanted.

Ever since that break I can't decide if I want to be with him or be single. What I love about being single is feeling wanted. I know my bf loves me but he never lusts for me. If I ever have doubts he never fights for our relationship. He tells me he just wants me to be happy, but if he showed some passion towards being with me it would fufil that need to be wanted. 

Also our relationship is kind of stagnate. Were both in the same exact situation as last year. I'm worried that he isn't focused enough on becoming successful. 

But our relationship provides love, comfort, support, the best friendship I've ever had, openness. These things I know I won't find from dating. And these things are so important for me. 

For some reason feeling wanted makes me feel like I'm at my best. I'm the most confident I can be. I feel good. And this need is enough to make me doubt wanting to be in my relationship. I literally cannot decide which is more important to me.

TL;DR:",  Love my boyfriend but our relationship is kind of stagnate. Feelings of wanting are conflicting with the fact that I love being single. Should I stay with him or be single?,  My relationship doesn't make me feel wanted. Enough so that I can't decide if we should stay together or go our separate ways.

TITLE: How do I [24M] move forward with live-in SO [34F]?

POST: The points: 

* I work in IT and am a pretty solitary guy, having her in my life makes me so much more at ease.  I have general anxiety so this is important.  

* I've never really felt ""love"" from anyone but her, I had a messed up childhood so having someone this close to me is new and exciting

* My college days were relatively intense, I'm yearning for the excitement of being single again but don't want to hurt SO, I'm constantly thinking about peers my age, eyes always wandering, not sexually attracted to SO anymore

* She's from another country on a student visa, been living with me for 8 months.  she moved in because she was living with 6 other girls in a 2br place, all worked at the same whip-wielding restaurant to pay for school

* Obviously hurting someone sucks and the feeling of being alone is terrifying (new city, no close friends)... but I do feel trapped, like I could be growing a lot more.  Was formerly polyamorous, jumped into this on impulse.  

* I told her I never intend on getting married or having kids.  She accepted that, we've been monogamous for 18 months 

* she doesn't know many other people so I offer some level of security, but taking that away by breaking up would ruin a big part of her life, she might go back home

Proposals from both sides of the political spectrum say that a reduction of spending is needed (with democrats proposing raising taxes in the upper braket?) but how big of a chunk of an anual budget would really be needed to put a dent in 14 trillion? You dont accumulate that kind of debt over night and i have difficulty seeing exactly how any reduction could even allow them to break even let alone start reducing this debt load given the rather large deficit administrations have been running.

And lets say for a minute that they cant figure out a way to ease off this debt ceiling, what are the consiquences for inaction? What are other means of solving this issue?

TITLE: Me [27F] with my friends [20sF] of 6 years, am I just being ridiculous?

POST: Last summer I met a girl online who we'll call Jo. Jo had just moved to my city, and we met up and became friends. I introduced her to my friends and she started coming to our group get togethers.

Over the months, I started realizing that Jo was extremely high maintenance and controlling. I felt like every few weeks she would be angry at me about something trivial.

The final straw was when I offered to introduce her to one of my single guy friends. She asked me to find out if he was interested. Unfortunately he was not, and when I told her this she took it out on me like it was somehow my fault. That was the final straw. I felt like our friendship was toxic and told her that she was too demanding and I couldn't be friends anymore. This was about three weeks ago.

I didn't tell any of my friends in the group (except for one because I sought her advice) because I didn't know what to do. Now I feel like she's doubled how much she's hanging out with my friends and I am going to run into her this weekend.

R/Relationships, please give me a reality check here. Is it completely wrong of me to tell my friends what happened? I feel bad putting them in a position to choose, but on the other hand I have been friends with all of them for years and want their support. I don't really know what to do.

POST: We've been dating for almost two years. My GF will often have 2-3 guys she is ""texting"" at a time. I assume they are all harmless convos but I cant get the worst case scenarios out of my mind like she is cheating on me with these guys or something. She says they are just friends but it doesnt ease my mind much. And I know she doesnt mean any harm by it. She's an attention craver. I think it stems back to daddy issues since she didnt grow up with a dad or much attention as a child.

I feel like this shouldnt be a big issue but I have a lot of insecurities when it comes to girls texting other guys. Ive had bad relationship exprriences with this in the past. Anyway my first instinct is to badger her about it. Asking things like, ""whos that?"" or ""is that a guy?"". Its just the way I am to be nosy like that but its not good. Any time I ask she gets really defensive and irritated that I ask so many questions and feels like I dont trust her. I know that me being like this is only hurting my relationship.

TITLE: I [22F] need advice about my sister [20F], depressed college drop out furry.

POST: Last week my sister told me that is now a furry. 

My sister dropped out of university after one semester two years ago. She's been living with my parents since then. She goes to a community college, but she has failed most of her classes there. She has almost no friends, and she spends most of her time alone in her room. She is very into anime, cosplay, MLP, and is now making a 'fursuit'. I'm very concerned about her. She seems to have no goals, dreams, or ambition and she keeps falling into weirder and weirder crowds. I've suggested that my parents kick her out into a student apartment, so that she will be surrounded by other girls her age. 

She will be 21 soon, on her way to adulthood, and she has shown no sign of growing up. She finally got her first minimum wage job about a month ago. My parents have saved up around 20K for her college fund, so she has the resources to go to college, but she cannot seem to pass her classes. She began taking Vyvanse for ADHD a few months ago, but I do not know if that has made any improvement. She has had boyfriends, but every one of them has been jealous and abusive.

She had an extremely abusive boyfriend a few years ago, who apparently beat and raped her before my parents got her out of that relationship. She has been in counseling because of that, and was diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. I'm sitting here with my Mom and we're pretty much at a loss here on how to handle this.

So I told him very superficially what happened in the past. He just looked at me for a long time and gave me a long hug.

TITLE: Thinking about therapy, implications for employment? Specifically: Peace Corps.

POST: I've been thinking about seeking some type of therapy (most likely CBT) for awhile now to help me deal with some social anxiety and negative thinking issues for some time. I've never done this sort of thing before and while I think I'm doing pretty well in bettering myself on my own, I'd like to make more progress and get an outside opinion on some things.

My concern is that if I seek therapy, and use my insurance to help pay for it, that this information could somehow be used against me when looking for employment. I just submitted an application to the Peace Corps and as part of that application it asked if I had ever seen a psychologist and if so, the date I saw them last. I answered no, which is true, but if I now go see a therapist and don't tell them, then I'm likely breaking rules that if they found out, could lead to my termination (and I guess possibly fines/jail).

Is there any way for them to find this out if I don't tell them? I really feel that it's a personal issue that doesn't concern them and I don't want it to influence my chances. Thanks!

We mutually broke up, and we were both  ok. But afterwards I didn't take it well; I drunkenly text and rang him. So I decided to delete him off facebook to stop myself from embarrassing myself further.

That was a few weeks ago and I don't know what to do. I feel so awful that I have lost not only my boyfriend but my best friend, and the idea that we can't even be friends really saddens me. I know I was in the wrong and I was so over dramatic, but I feel this is mostly to do with the fact I'm not really enjoying my time abroad.

I kind of wish I'd never left my home country and him, I was happy there. I don't know what I expected to find here but I haven't.
Should I just leave this and move on?

TITLE: Me[18M/F] with my ___ [18M/F] duration, short-description

POST: [Previous Post](

---

So I snooped again because I saw a text pop up from him last week on her phone.

Last Saturday night, she texted him out of the blue just before 10pm saying ""what u up to tonight?"". This is a week after he last texted her and she didn't respond. This was in a 20 min gap when she wasn't with me. She was drunk too.

She then met up with me shortly after at 10pm so didn't respond to any of his texts for the rest of the night/she got too drunk to function and I had to take her home.

The rest of his texts were about asking her to meet up etc with last text being at 1am. This is when I saw the text as I was still up and her phone was on the table. I decided not to snoop further at that stage.

She hasn't text back since then.

I know all of this because I only decided to snoop last night because it's been bugging me ever since. She got blind drunk last night so I had to meet up with my mate and her on the street and help her get home. She was in memory blank drunk mode. On a work night too. Which just made me think wtf is going on with her so I snooped when she was passed out.

Also remembered something she said to me a few weeks ago, she said

""I used to text other guys when I was with my past boyfriends, because basically I got bored, but with you I don't have to because you're so fun"" or something like that.

And ever since she said that it's been in the back of my mind, contributing to my insecurity, and has me thinking oh is this the start of this sort of behavior.

I think you guys are right that I don't trust. And I have to admit it too. I don't trust her that much at the moment due to her behavior and my insecurities.

TL;DR:","  snooped again, found evidence of her texting other guys behind my back. Feeling insecure and paranoid about her. Don't trust her at the moment. What do I do?","  2 weeks ago, guy was texting my girl sounding keen as to meetup. gf didn't text back. I snooped on her phone"

TITLE: TIFU by zoning out and burning myself

POST: This fuck up happened less than 30 minutes ago... do I get a prize?

Background: I am a high school student and I generally pride myself for being part of the upper group as far as intelligence is concerned, but after my fuck up, I have been considerably humbled. 

The Fuck Up: I was in chemistry today and we were doing a lab. In this particular lab we were using a little bowl called a crucible.  The crucible was still wet after being washed at the end of the last class, therefore the first instruction was to heat it over a burner to dry it out. 

We heated the crucible for the required two minutes and sat it at the table to cool, as it was cooling I began to read the instructions for the next step, which required us to find its  mass. My mind had begun to wander from the lab, when I remembered what needed to be done. I promptly said ""Let me just mass this."" I grabbed the crucible. The blazing hot, just heated by fire for two minutes crucible. It burned, seeking to remove it from my hand and stop the pain. I flung it to the ground and it shattered. 

The looks I received from my teacher and the other students were those of bewilderment. They were bewildered at how I could be so stupid as to grab an incredibly hot crucible. I am shamed, and my burned finger hurts.

TL;DR:","  While doing a lab, I grabbed an extremely hot crucible which shattered when I tried to mass it. I am ashamed and my burnt finger hurts.","  I forgot what I was doing and grabbed at very hot thing, I burned myself and got looks from other students that make me feel dumb."

TITLE: My[26M] fiancée [27F] is upset I stayed out late after a concert, I think she is over reacting.

POST: I am in a long distance relationship with my fiancée. I really like concerts, and go often. I went to a concert on Friday night, and meet an adorable couple at the show. We really hit it off with them. I liked him a lot, he was really cool, and she was really sweet/precious. We ended up staying out till 5 am and had a blast.

I normally text her when I am home, but apparently I passed out without properly hitting the button. (The message was all typed out and everything.) When I woke up at 9, I apologized for not texting her, because I know she wants me to be safe.

Last night, she basically said I was stupid and unsafe for doing what I did. I didn't know them, and I was not being smart. I told her that I really trusted them, and that they were harmless. She said she didn't care.

I have traveled the world. I have been to over 20 countries and backpacked with strangers for weeks, in the mountains. This makes me nervous that she thinks this was so dangerous, as this seems like such a small thing to me.

Am I thinking about this wrongly?

TITLE: Me [20m] and my ex [20f] broke up due to her parents beliefs.

POST: This had been going on most of our relationship (6 months) but her parents go to a Church of Christ and long story short, if I'm not on par with their religion, then I'm not allowed to date her. They've met me once and didn't see that I was good enough so it wasn't allowed no matter what she tried telling them.  She's suffocated by them and doesn't know where she is on religion due to them forcing it on her. She definitely doesn't agree with a lot of their beliefs. 

We have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for 6 months, and I still have that feeling I got the the first week we dated. Now she broke up with me because we have been hiding it the whole time and she started getting frustrated with lying and being scared of them figuring out because the consequences would be pretty great.

Neither her or I are in the position to move out so options on how this could work are very limited. Talking to them really isn't going to do anything because they're so deep in religion, that there's no if, ands, or buts. We're in a rough spot and are both really stressed out and would like to be together but them finding out would not be pretty. Does anyone have an suggestions or experience with this? It'd be MUCH appreciated as I'm very upset and just want this all better.

TITLE: [m24] currently dating a very young girl

POST: Currently I'm in a pretty good relationship with a girl who is younger than the ""half your age plus 7"" rule. Actually she has just hit the age of consent (16) and we have been dating pretty seriously for 5 months. Honestly I felt pretty bad about it in the beginning because when I was younger I always despised older guys dating really young girls. Now I have become what I once hated.... 

I truly felt when I was going to first meet her Chris Hansen was going to show up with some cameras.

But no, we have not had any sexual relations yet. However, I can honestly say I do like her for much more than that. She is much more mature,  honest and straight forward than other girls my age, which I find really attractive.

She has also told me her mother met her dad at the age of 15, married 5 years later and were happy ever since. This gives me some kind of hope.

Do Parents Know?: Currently her mother is only aware that we ""talking"" but not the depth of the relationship. I know her mother personally since she is a friend of the family. However, I have not introduced myself as her daughter's companion yet. I would rather do the whole meet and greet the family when she turns 18.

I'm wondering if there are currently any other redditors out there that have had a similar (successful) experience?

TITLE: [19/m] I am in my freshman year of college with my girlfriend [18/f]. I am having an easier time adjusting and it's putting a strain on our relationship.

POST: I'll try to make this as brief as I can.

My girlfriend and I started dating during our junior year in high school and we ended up going to the same university. When we first moved in, we were both a bit overwhelmed, and it was really helpful to the both of us that we had each other during the transition. 

Since I have always adjusted pretty easily to new situations, I started to become pretty comfortable around week 3. I have gotten know a ton of people, I've made new friends and I've been doing very well in all my classes.

She, on the other hand, has been having a tougher time. She feels like she hasn't made any friends, is really struggling in her classes, and she's feeling pretty lost. I've been doing everything I can to be there for her, and spend all the time with her that I can, but it seems like we're on two different wavelengths.

One of the main reasons we're running into trouble is that since I'm meeting a ton of people and having a great time, she's worried that she's holding me back from everything. The thing is, I want to meet new friends and everything, but I wanna do it with her. I always try to get her to hang out with my friends, but she never seems happy. When I ask her why, she always says ""they're your friends, you all know each other.""

It's beginning to feel like I have to choose between her and my friends, and I don't want that. I love being with her, but it seems like lately, I'm all she has. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the long post!

POST: I'm starting this by saying that I realize I'm extremely lucky, and I don't want to fuck it up. I don't have a precedent for my situation, so I need your collective advice:

In a few years, I'll be leaving college with no debt. I've managed a very small part-time job in addition to being full time student ($2400 in 2012, which I will file taxes on!). I'm looking at ~$3000 for 2012, + an internship stipend (which won't be much).

I've been depositing my checks at a 2:1 Savings:Checkings ratio.

I don't have a car and I won't need one. My room and food is taken care of (I even managed to get free housing for the summer) while I'm in college, and my parents have offered me a (rent-free) couch while I'm job-searching post-graduation.

Basic goals for post-graduation:
Out of my parents' house by winter, into an apartment, with a job.
It's not very realistic, but some recent alum from my department have managed it.

Then we stated seeing them. We told maintenance and they came by and put traps down. We caught a good 3 or 4 mice. Then we started catching 1 every couple of weeks and seeing/hearing them every couple of days. The apartment management just kept on sending us traps. Now the mice seem to have had babies because we see mice multiple times a day and they are getting into all of my food. management seems to think that providing us traps is all they have to do and its our problem. This is a serious problem that traps won't fix. We need an exterminator but they clearly don't want to pay for one to come. But this is a health risk in my opinion. Is there any sort of legal action I can take? Or at least threaten to take to get them to act?

Some back story. She had a boyfriend before me let's call him, John. She and John and a pretty rocky relationship from what I was told and witnessed myself. Anyway after a while they broke up and we got together and it was great. Fast forward to when I was away on holiday during Christmas 2012, she ends up seeing him and says how nothing happened between them. However after another incident in August she let me read through her texts and I found one from that day saying ""Last night can't mean nothing. What was i thinking. Im not that type of person"" And then a day or so after he sent something saying ""Sorry about your neck"" (she was big on biting necks and loves it done to her too)

So yeah she says she didn't sleep with him when she told me about this when it happened. But I don't think I believe her just because how she's lied to me in the past about seeing him and especially after reading those messages. Should I bring it up with her somehow or what?

We had a decent conversation going and it abruptly stopped. It was late, she probably fell asleep. So I followed the double texting rule and waited three days to try to reach out again. After I got the conversation going I asked her if she would like to meet me for coffee and she said she wouldn't be able to that week because of how busy she was with a weeklong philanthropy event. Even though she kept the conversation going for a while (that abruptly stopped again) I took it as a rejection and decided I wouldn't press it again. After that, I told another mutual friend who sits next to her in class and she said she actually was really busy with this philanthropy event and not to take it personal and that she'd talk to her about relationships without mentioning my name. So they talked and this girl told her a guy had been mean to her and she wanted to focus on school.

This was about three weeks ago, and her close friend said she'd give it one more try. I want to.

TITLE: We did it! Review + Pictures!

POST: My husband (!!) and I tied the knot April 9th, we planned every little detail ourselves and paid for it ourselves. (Well with some help from my parents). And all decor was DIY'D. It was a LONG year and a half, but seeing it all come together was worth it!

Some things that went well...

* Seeing my husband's face during our first look. He bawled like a baby and it was the most treasured moment of the whole day and probably my whole life. 

* Our officiant killed it! We had guest after guest comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, some said it was the most emotional wedding they'd ever been too. And a friend's mom said our vows made her question her marriage (yeah, that was a weird comment). But it was worth it to custom curate our ceremony with our officiant, it was so special and even though I was so nervous I'm glad we wrote our own vows. 

Things that went wrong...

* My father in law hit my day of coordinator's car before the ceremony... I didn't find out about it until we checked into our hotel that night. But during our first dance it was funny to hear my husband go ""I have so much to tell you..."" Everything was fine though! He just scraped the side of her truck with his, but she handled it like a PRO. She just told him well, today is you son's day so we'll exchange info later and take care of it tomorrow, let's worry about the wedding first. She really was just fantastic all around.

Advice...

* Get a day of coordinator if you can. It is SO much easier than taking care of it yourself/having a friend or family member do it. We paid $500 for a DoC to setup/break down everything and she really made the day go smoothly and kept us on top of everything.

* Make as detailed of a timeline as possible. It was a little stressful coordinating who was leaving the hotel with who to the venue, etc. Also my husband had to pick a lot of people up at the airport, so maybe pay a friend from your area to be a designated taxi. It was different with us since 90% of our guests were out of town.

POST: So my gf (let's call her Amy) and I have been dating for over 3 years. We've gone through a lot of things together, good and bad. She was my first kiss, first gf, and I lost my virginity to her. We have had many talks about the future and getting married to each other. 

We regularly hang out with the same group of friends in and out of school. It consists of roughly 10 people. Around 3 of them are guys. The thing is we are all very close and hang out pretty much all the time. I've been getting very close to one of the girls in the group (let's call her Nancy). I was friends with her before I started dating Amy. Recently, I've gotten very close to Nancy. I've told her many things that I wouldn't even tell Amy. Some people have accused us up of ""flirting"" and have told Amy, who easily gets upset. Now, I'm a friendly person to begin with. I'm fine with making contact with all of my friends and I mess around with all of them, so I don't think of it as flirting. 

This has put me under a lot of pressure recently though. Since our group is mainly girls, I talk to girls pretty much everyday. But I feel like I have to act differently due to my gf. I feel like I can't laugh as much or talk as much, so Amy won't get jealous. 

Nancy trusts me and I trust her. We're pretty much best friends. But I think I might be developing a crush on her. 

I've started to care for Amy a little less, but I'm pretty sure I still love her. Breaking up with her would also be very awkward because we hang around the same group of people and our class is very small (97). Thank you.

TL;DR:",  Been dating my gf for 3 years. We hang out with many friends. Recently started to get close to one of the girls in our group. I think I might have a crush on her. Should I break up?,  I'm not sure if I still love my girlfriend.  I might have a crush on a mutual friend. Breaking up would be awk because we have the same friends.

POST: Growing up I always knew there was something off about him. I loved him to pieces, but he was always adamantly anti-government and anti-corporation. I know a lot of us redditors are too but as time went on its manifested its self in different ways.

We went to the movie theater one day and he complained that someone took a picture of him. He thought he was being spied on and wanted to leave. (There was no one there, it was in his mind)

Our family got a call yesterday, and it seems now he won't even leave his trailer to get food. He told the neighbor that the voices told him to stand in a hole in his house to keep people away. He's getting worse, and tomorrow I'm going to be going with my mom and anut to help deal with the situation.

I was reading on wikipedia that only .3 - .7% of the population is effected Schizophrenia; which is what we believe it is as this point. I'm really hoping I can find someone to help me out here. Have you known someone who has had Schizophrenia, how did you deal with it? Any advice you can give us?

POST: My ex and I dated for 6 1/2 years and it ended HORRIBLY! He started all but dating this other girl while we were still together (emotional cheating, never anything physical). The thing is, the whole time I was reading his texts behind his back and saw his conversations with the girl, our mutual best friend, and his sister all shit talking me while having this relationship develop. I felt so crazy constantly reading his texts but everytime I would look I would find something for months. Finally, I got the strength to dump him, told him I hate him and never talk to me again, and got a new BF about a month later and we're so happy together and living together now. The ex is still with the same girl. 

TODAY I contacted my ex for the first time in a year and a half. I just said I don't hate you and I'm sorry for how I reacted. He said he was so happy I didn't hate him and gave me some updates about his life. It's been friendly messages and it feels like this weight is lifted off my shoulders because I don't have this burned bridge out there in the universe. (my current bf knows everything and is perfectly fine with me getting the closure I need). 

Here's the thing: I've always, always thought for the last year and a half that I will finally be completely healed once I can tell him that I reacted so strongly because I was reading his texts and knew the whole situation. He only told me that he went to the library with her once, so he thinks I just reacted in a crazy strong way over that. I need to say to him: Look, I reacted so strongly because I was reading the texts between you and her, you and our mutual friend, and you and your sister. I saw all the shit you talked about me and I thought that you hated me which made me want to hate you. I need to say something like that to him now to finally put this all behind me but I don't know how to say it without making myself seem insane and like I'm still living in the past. I need advice on this desperately please help.

TITLE: Me [24, M] with my girlfriend[23, F] have been together long distance almost a year, needing advice on long term plan.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but it's been entirely long distance (9 hours apart) with us taking turns seeing each other on weekends twice a month, and spending a week together on a couple occasions. 

My girlfriend was job hunting at the beginning of this past summer when there were two jobs opening up. One about 20 minutes from my house, another an hour further north of where she had been living. The job that was further away gave her $10K more a year than what she would've made living by me. I had no problem encouraging  this path because we had only been together a few months at that time, and wouldn't want her throwing her future away for me. 

Due to some unfortunate circumstances (my dad being in the hospital, her having to work multiple hours of overtime, a couple deaths in her family, etc.) we haven't been able to see each other this month and during the holidays. She told me a few weeks ago that she felt bad that she couldn't come home to me and felt lonely even though we can and do Skype, and basically that the distance is hurting her. I had already been thinking about moving up there, but was going to wait until the school year is over so I don't leave my employer in a sticky situation.

I'm a teacher at a private school, and even though my pay isn't awful, I'd be the one to make the move since it's an easier move for me. It also helps that I have friends that live in and around the same city she lives and works in. I want to offer to move up there, but don't know how to bring it up to her as we've been somewhat distant with everything going on.

TITLE: TIFU by contaminating an Indian village's drinking water source.

POST: So this happened a few weeks ago on my holiday to India. Back story: Indian toilets don't usually have toilet paper and are more often than not simply a hole in the ground that you squat over. I went to deposit a particularly nasty load of liquid shit or what the locals refer to as ""Delhi belly"". I'd also recently been given some very expensive glasses by my parents and was under pain of death not to lose them. So I was squatting down unleashing this never ending torrent of diarrhoea when my glasses dropped off my head and fell down the hole. In a state of blind panic and fear I shoved my hand into the bottomless pit of shit in an attempt to find my glasses and, after dipping my arm elbow-deep in shit, eventually discovered them and pulled them out. As they were covered in shit I didn't put them on and instead stumbled around outside half blind to find somewhere to wash them off, finding a small shack surrounded by what I assumed was a queue of people with a huge urn of water inside. Pushing through the crowd, I quickly rinsed my shit covered arm and glasses in this urn of cold water, returned the glasses to their rightful place and, feeling rather pleased with my lucky escape, strolled outside. I then realised my FU....the queue was full of people holding various jugs and cups and a sign on the shack read ""DRINKING WATER"" in bright red bold letters.

POST: As is custom, I'll start. 

For one reason or another, my full time job ended up not having any work for me to do during the summer, so I decided to take a part time job. A statewide-famous sandwich shop in my state decided to open up a new store in my town, and I applied and was hired immediately. I started training last week, and we opened the store up for the first time this week.

Yesterday, while pulling a double covering for someone else, my boss informs me that I've been promoted, including a raise and further duties with closing the store and sending reports off to the franchise at the end of the night, etc. I'm pleased, since a promotion in a week seems like a good thing to me. Fast forward two hours, and my boss has a personal emergency. He pulls me into his office, explains the situation, and says, ""I hate to drop this all on you tonight, but I'm gonna need you to take over as manager. I figured it'd happen anyway, but wanted to give you more time to ease into it. You gonna be okay to do it?"" I accepted, and he left to handle his business, with me in charge of two teenagers who'd worked there just as long as I had.

It was pretty harmless, but it is clear that he still as feelings for me. When we hung out this weekend it was a bit awkward.

POST: Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am having a bit of an anxiety fit over my current situation. If there is a more appropriate sub, please direct me to it.

I recently graduated from a specialized technical program and since graduating have had a ridiculous number of job offers and interview requests. I have actually turned down a number of interviews. 

I had a job lined up several months ago, but it was honestly not something I was very enthusiastic about, I only took the offer because they were the first to contact me and I was not sure what the job market in my field was like. We'll call then company A.

Long story short, I interviewed with another company last week, let's call them company B, and they exceeded all expectations and are basically a dream come true. They paid for my flight to their facility for the interview, put me up in a hotel and paid for a rental car. I had also previously turned in my notice with my current employer at the time, because company A, which I had already accepted an offer from, had expected me to start this coming week. I left the interview with company B feeling confident but without any offer in hand. Fast forward to today, I have notified company A that I won't be able to start with them and so am officially unemployed and awaiting some word from company B.

Am I insane to expect that company B is going to make some kind of offer? Should I be scrambling to find something solid? I have enough funds to keep me going for a few months if absolutely necessary.

To add some clarification, this is completely out of character for me, I have never left an employer without having a guaranteed job lined up already. I have no experience in this field but have a good amount of general management experience.

I'm not saying I want to try and be him. But I know that I pretty much never flirt because I feel like if I flirt at all or give any kind of compliment, it could be taken as ""verbal abuse"". For example, I say ""Hey so and so, I love your hair, it looks really good"". There was one time I actually just genuinely liked how a girl's hair looked, it was a unique color, and wanted to compliment her on it. I asked a female friend of mine who was nearby if it would be okay if I told the girl, and my friend says it would have been creepy.

TITLE: [19f]Keeping an innocent (but somewhat significant) piece of information from my boyfriend of a few months [21m]...

POST: Honestly, I'm not sure how significant this piece of information is in the context of our relationship.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a few months now, and he doesn't know that the drunken dance-floor makeout we had a little over a year ago, the first time we met, was my first kiss.

I've kissed plenty of other people since then, so it's not like he's the only person I've ever kissed. I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. 

Basically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.

Should I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my ""first"" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. 

I'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer. The topic of first kisses may come up at some point before then, though.

But we don't know what to do to help him get over this, and whenever we talk about it it only makes it worse.  It's been a year and he insists he still needs more time to even know if it's possible.  At what point do I walk?

TITLE: [24f] having trouble bringing up the status of my relationship with the older [32] guy I'm seeing

POST: So. I've been seeing a guy now for a few months. I met him right as I was getting out of a messy relationship that really fucked with my head. But he's made me so happy since I've started seeing him and I can really see a future with him. But we haven't yet talked about where we see this going. We've both said we aren't sleeping with other people, but we haven't yet said whether or not we want to be in a relationship. I'm having trouble bringing up the subject. Mostly because my last relationship ended so badly and it makes me nervous to let someone else in. I'm also worried that our age difference might be too much for him because every once in a while he'll make a joke about how young I am. 

I know that being scared to have this conversation seems stupid and most of you will probably think that I shouldn't be with someone I can't have this conversation with. But I guess I just can't decide if having this talk after only a couple months is rushing into something or if I'm going to sound crazy. I guess I just need a pep talk or something. Any advice is greatly appreciated

TITLE: Me [32 M] with my girlfriend [30 F] of 1 1/2 years, found her online dating profile, not sure what to do

POST: I've been seeing this girl for 1 1/2 years, mostly long distance.  Recently found her facebook and while digging around I found an online dating profile with pictures of her.  After confronting her on the phone and skype, she tearfully said her sister made the profile without her knowledge.  But most of the pictures on her profile is not on her FB and the description on the profile sounds uncannily like her.  Like the writing style is like hers.

Honestly, I never thought of her as the type to cheat on me.  But when I read the profile, I didn't have any doubts it's her.  Also, why would her 26 year old sister, married with children, want to create a fake online dating profile with her older sister's photos?  I can't explain it and neither could she.

Never thought this would happen (again) in my life.  You'd think by the time people hit their 30's this shit would stop.  Why do I feel like I'm still in high school.  Fucking relationships suck ass.

Now I'm not sure what to do.  I think I should just dump her and move on.  Having a hard time believing she'd do this, but I'm also having a hard time believing her sister would do this.  I need some advice reddit.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years, have different sleep patterns - says im selfish

POST: I've been with my girlfriend for almost 5 years and we recently bought our own house and moved in at Christmas.

I've always ran on about 6 - 7 hours sleep, and prior to moving in, I'd always do my own thing when I got home.  I'd play games, learn some code until I was tired which was usually until about half 12.  

My girlfriend is always tired and wakes up early for her job, she's usually up at 7 and out of the house by 8.  She goes to bed at 10:30 so gets about 8 - 9 hours sleep a night.

I've been trying to get into this sleep pattern, but I just find myself lying awake at night or being shattered the next day from too much sleep.

I'm wanting to spend some time playing some games, and with most people my age, the only time we get is later at night - hence the reason I was usually playing games from about 10 - 12:30.

Now we're living together, she complains that I either wake her up because she's a light sleeper, and how it's unfair for me to go to bed later because I should be thinking about her.

Personally I think this is wrong to simply demand this, but she's as stubborn as they come, and trying to talk sense into her just results in an argument.  I've tried explaining the above, or using the fact that when she wakes up in the morning, her alarm wakes me up, as does her getting dressed etc so I end up waking up an hour earlier due to her.  

I should add that I work from home in a stressful job, but she uses this as an excuse as to why I should respect her sleeping hours and go to bed at the same time (even if i lie awake for hours).  I can't go to bed later, I can't use my laptop in bed to code, yet she has to have the TV on to go to sleep to (I can't stand this)

I don't really know how else to tackle it, as everything gets turned into me being the bad guy and its all about her

TL;DR:","  Girlfriend has different sleep pattern than me, says I'm selfish for demanding that I go to bed at the same time as her, and its turning into a constant argument.  How can I resolve this?","  GF & I have different sleep schedules.  She expects me to go to bed at the same time as her due her getting up for work, and me going to bed later wakes her up."

TITLE: Me [21 M] broken up about break up with girl [21 F]

POST: I have already posted about this girl previously but just for quick background, we have known each other a while, dated for about 4-5 months, although she has had feelings for about a year. A few days ago she ended things with me and I suppose I am writing this more to vent, since I was numb to the break up until today.

For a few weeks before I could tell she was pulling away. She said she felt pressured into being official, and was scared due to a very large amount of outside stress, mainly due to her grandmother being very sick in the hospital for months. About 2 weeks ago we had a large fight, where she was very iffy about making plans for a date and I was annoyed because she had been flakey about dates recently. We talked a few days ago and she said that she had intended to give it time and see where it went but after that fight she suddenly lost feelings.

Being honest, I am devastated. I had fallen hard for this girl and the idea that I had pressured her into things and caused her to lose feelings is a tough pill to swallow. That being said, I doubt there is much I can do to ""fix"" things and try again, and she is so guilty about hurting me I doubt she would even tell me if she did still have feelings or redeveloped them. Still, any advice, comments, words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: TIFU by letting my 7 year old sister crash her friend's go kart into his dad's porsche.

POST: I'll start off by giving you a little background.  I am 16, and my little sister is 7.  She was bored and wanted to go hang out at her friend's house down the street.  So I took her there.

When we got there, her friend insisted on showing me his new go kart. So I said sure.  We went to his garage, and he showed me his go kart.  I asked if I can try it out and he said sure. I rode it around for about a minute and then got off.

Then my sister asked if she can try it. I was skeptical at first because she's never driven anything like this.  But then I thought, *""It has four wheels. It's not like she's gonna flip it or anything.""*

So I told her she can. I showed her all the controls. How to steer, how to go, and how to brake. Then I step away and let her go.

She then proceeded to drive straight into a Porsche. Her friend's dad's Porsche.  Everyone freaked out, and ran inside to tell him.  And to make matters worse, they exaggerated a lot and told him the scratch was ***huge*** and she was going ***super fast*** when she crashed into it.

The dad was super nice about it, but I felt guilty as fuck. I said sorry multiple times. And I told my sister to apologize but she never did.

Then about 20 minutes later as we were leaving, I told my sister to go say thank you for all the snacks they gave her and for being so cool about everything.  But instead of saying thank you, she started crying because she didn't want to go. The crying then turned into screaming and yelling and calling me names.  I finally had to carry her out of there because she refused to leave.  I kept on apologizing as we were leaving.

I've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life.

She graduates from school in a few months and has this really great chance for a 1yr + internship in Boston, NY, or NJ (we currently live on the western part of the country) and may end up staying out of state beyond the 1yr if she finds a grad school she likes out there. Now the hard thing is that she wants me to move with her to where ever she ends up going and I flat out told her I wasn't comfortable with that **at all!** I don't even feel comfortable with moving in with her right now let alone leaving everything else behind to move across the country. I told her to go if she gets the opportunity because I'll be damned if I'm the thing to hold her back. The hard part about this is that we already tried the long distance thing at the beginning of her schooling 4 years ago and ended up breaking up for the first year that she was gone. She wants to go and would be willing to try the long distance thing again and keeps asking about my thoughts on doing LDR again. She also wants to try even though she seem hopeful it would work based on past experience and quite frankly I don't even want to try a LDR again (horrible shit). Every time she brings it up she basically leaves the decision on me about what we are going to do and I don't know what to do Reddit.

TITLE: TIFU and flooded my bathroom

POST: This happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the mood for a hot, foamy bath. I go into the bathroom, hop into the tub, add some bath salts (and no, I'm not craving for human flesh) and some of that thing that produces foam (I'm not English, sorry!) and lay on my back, eyes closed.

I should mention by now that our drain plug is chipped and lets water leak from the tub into the drain, so I usually take it out and put a plastic bag. It worked like a charm. Until today.

After 2-3 minutes, I hear bubbles in the secondary drain (the one on the floor made to prevent floods. Ironic, huh?) and realize that the water was at half the original level.

No biggie. I reach for the plastic bag to adjust it and realize that it'a gone. I look to the bathroom floor only to see it entirely flooded. The plastic bag was sucked into the drain and clogged it. By now, the tub was empty. I jumped out and ran to grab some towels. To my relief, the bag was flushed down and the water started going down the drain.

But I didn't finish bathing. And guess what? No hot water left. After a manly cold bath, I get out, dry myself and prepare for the worst. 

My house has a pretty weird structure. It's made by two buildings. One hosts the bedrooms and living-room, and the other hosts the kitchen and bathroom. They are connected, but there is no door between. From one to the other is a 10 meter walk. And I had to walk slowly since the ground was frozen, and it was cold as fuck outside. 

Now you may be wondering why I bathed in cold water instead of showering tomorrow morning. It's because my overly-protective parents forbid me from bathing/showering immediately before going out to prevent me from catching a cold.

TL;DR:","  My drain plug is chipped and lets water leak into the secondary drain, which is connected to the ground.

POST: BT provided us with a ""homehub"" (router) which has a built in phone. The phone has never worked, and yet we can only use that phone to get the 'free' calls that we pay for. Because it doesn't work it means we have to use a second phone, which means we receive very high charges.

My father called BT support up and asked them if they could repair it and, failing that, replace it, because the damage is nothing to do with us, and any and all filters on the phone have been checked and replaced, yet still nothing. They said ""we will repair the phone happily, just pay us £140 and we will send out an engineer""

Obviously we don't want this, we would rather just have a new hub, i mean it has to be cheaper for both sides for them to just replace it? it must cost them what, £40 to produce?

anyway, down to the point, they aren't budging, is there anything anyone could suggest we do to make the robbing bastards give us what we pay (heavily) for?

TITLE: TIFU by trusting a fart.

POST: This just happened. I don't write very well, so please excuse my grammar. 

We'll start off with my morning. I wake up late for work. Had to be at work for 0730, woke up at 0710. I work for an ambulance service as an EMT and I am currently in paramedic school doing clinicals every other day I'm not working a 24 hour shifts on the boo boo bus. So I'm rushing around trying to get my uniform together when I fell a dart brewing. Ok seems innocent enough. No. It was a bubble of doom. I knew instantly as it was coming out that it was too late and I had just destroyed a nice fresh pair of boxers. So the boxers get thrown away and now I'm wasting even more time sitting on the toilet. My bowels are doing back flips and now I'm even more late for work. So I finish as fast I could then frantically find a new pair boxers and finish getting my shit together and get out the door for a 20 min drive to work. 

When I get to work I remembered I keep a bottle of pepto bismol in my box. Thinking it would help settle my stomachs and colon I decide to take some. Well that was possibly the worst idea I could of had st the time. Someone had decided to play a joke on me and put hot sauce in my medicine. Instant burning all the way down. My stomach is now doing front flips and back flips and side flips and any other flip you could possible image. Now I need to vomit. Made it in time to the bathroom luckily. That pepto was the only thing I had in my stomach and it felt like I was spewing hell fire. Now I like some spice here and there but this was hot hot. Not a flavor hot. So now I feel even worse and I just started my 24 hour shift. Yay.

TL;DR:","  Tried to settle my stomach with pepto bismol, someone put hot sauce in it and now I'm experiencing extreme stomach flips and back flips. 24 hour shift now.",  I shartted this morning and I drank a half pepto half hot sauce mix drink that came right back out.

TITLE: Drama with my BF's roommates

POST: My boyfriend lives with four other guys, one of whom he shares a room, Max. A few days ago, we got into a heated argument that almost resulted in us breaking up. We didn't because most of the issues we have  are because of Max, a 22 year old stoner who spends the majority of his day playing video games. Max does not have a job, go to class, and lives off of his parents money, most of which goes to weed and eating out. Because of Max's influence, my boyfriend has started gaming and smoking more. At Max's request, I've stopped coming over as much and doing certain things that bother him, such as coming in from the backdoor, knocking on the window to have someone unlock the door, bringing over extra changes of clothes, etc. All of these requests are reasonable enough but they have brought stress onto my relationship nonetheless. Other than that, we get along OK.

While my boyfriend and I were fighting, I called Max ""a useless piece of shit."" It was unnecessary and I certainly regret it, but it was honest. However, though we were outside, one of my boyfriend's other roommates overheard when he came to smoke a cigarette and told Max what I said. My boyfriend isn't asking me to apologize to Max, but obviously that's what he would like me to do.

So here's my issue: I don't mind apologizing to Max but I feel like the informant roommate shouldn't have said anything to Max in the first place. My words weren't meant for other people and the other roommate knows that Max and I get along for the most part. Do I have a right to be angry at the other roommate?

TITLE: I (22 M) like everything about this woman (23 F) but her weight.

POST: Backstory: I'm originally from Maryland, but I just came back from doing a summer internship in Boston. In late July, I met this woman from OKC.. we were sexting pics within a couple days of first contact and at first I thought all this was going to be was a hookup because of the way things started. When I first saw her in real life she ended up being a lot bigger than I anticipated and I quickly noted that she was not my ideal body type but I still enjoyed the sex.

After sex, we just laid on my bed and talked for about 3-4 hours. We found that we had a lot in common and I realized that I actually enjoyed her company. She even bought me Chipotle afterwards. We decided we wanted to keep seeing each other, even though we both knew that I had to go back home to Maryland soon to finish up my last year of school. 

Fast forward to last week (Aug 24), she ends up coming down to visit me for the week at my parents' place in Maryland (where I'm staying for the next 2 semesters). She's met my parents and sister.

Basically, I find that I really enjoy her company, her personality, the way she supports me in my hobbies/aspirations.. everything except her body type. We have TONS of sex (2-3 times a day) but one time I couldn't finish and she asked if I thought she was unattractive and honestly I don't really find her body attractive but I think she has a gorgeous face. Of course I didn't tell her this I just said that I think she is beautiful. 

I like everything about this woman except her weight. She is about 5'6 and 155 and I am that same weight but I am 5'9. Sometimes I feel like I'm settling in the looks department (is this shallow?) because up until this point in my life I've only dated skinny/athletic women.

TITLE: Looking for a Good Cat Feeder/Toy

POST: Hey everyone!  I need some help.  Me and my girlfriend have two cats who have gotten a little food obsessed.  They were both kinda fat at one point so we, with the advice of our vet, put them on a diet of organic wet food (we use Prowl, the dehydrated stuff that you add water to).

Well, they're getting a little obnoxious now.  We used to keep their food on top of the fridge, but once they went on a diet they figured out how to climb up on top of the fridge, knocked the box over and ate like a half a box of dehydrated cat food.  So, we moved it to our laundry room, on top of the washer/dryer combo.  If we ever left the door cracked they were up there again, tearing into the box.  The final straw came this weekend when we had left the door closed but they got it anyway!  How you ask?  Well we live in a loft, and they actually climbed on top of the bathroom (there's like four feet between the bathroom ceiling and the loft ceiling) found their way in the laundry room through the roof of the closet and tore open the box of food.

I think partly they need something to do!  We both work a lot and I take care of my grandma on the weekends so they're home alone a lot.  I want one of those toys that you can put treats in and they have to play with it to get them out.  I've tried Kong stuff, and while they love to play with the ""snowman ball"" they don't seem interested in/able to get out food I put in it (it came with some kind of salmon paste).  I need a good toy that will let a little food out at a time to keep their attention away from raiding the food box and keep them entertained while we're gone.  Anyone have something that works well for them?

So first of all thank you for reading this, now let's get into the meat of my dilemma

I'm currently going to college and my parents have graciously allowed me to live in their home while I'm going to college so I can save the maximum amount of money possible, for which I am very grateful. 

My father lost is Job about six months ago and has been vigorously looking for a new one. He recently has had two opportunities for employment come up. the problem is that one is in the middle of nowhere in the state we live in. They have invited me to go with them to which I have declined; I would like to stay in my current city and finish my degree. 

my anxiety has been running haywire.

logically I make enough money to live with a roommate, pay all of my bills, have extra fun money, and STILL save money. 

but my mind has been wracking itself with self deprecating thoughts and its honestly annoying. I was in the army and I managed just fine, so its not like I haven't been on my own before. I really don't know where this is coming from.  

I'll honestly be fine no what. I would honestly enjoy the option where my parents stay and I keep wracking up savings but I'm also fine with the other option as well, but my mind keeps telling me otherwise.

so I need your advice. How do I quell these thoughts of doom?

TITLE: My [35f] ex [34m] is physically abusing his girlfriend [30somethingF]. Should I talk to her?

POST: My ex and I were together for six years, which culminated with him holding a gun to my head threatening to murder me while he was under the influence of a drug (MXE). He has a lot of mental health problems and the drug abuse certainly does not help. 

Since the end of our relationship three+ years ago, he's been in a relationship with one woman and told me that he had gotten clean, which I've since learned is a lie. We have very little contact. Last weekend a mutual friend was with the ex and his gf and he was intoxicated and choked his gf in front of other people. The gf said it's happened a number of times. The next morning when everyone was sober, the gf tried to brush it off and act like everything was fine. She lives with him with her two young children. He still has guns. I'm absolutely terrified for her. 

On one hand, it isn't any of my business. My life changed substantially for the better after getting out of the relationship with my ex and I don't want to involve myself in any drama. I dropped him and everyone associated with him (other than this one mutual friend) back then because of how messed up I was after the gun incident. On the other, I feel like I should tell her about what happened to me so that she knows exactly who she's dealing with (although she may already know). His behavior is clearly escalating, he has guns, and he's still abusing this drug. My current boyfriend, whose opinion I value immensely, says that I should leave it be, but he is obviously biased.

I can't look at this situation objectively. What, if anything, should I do?

POST: Need some perspective! 

I've been in 2 long-term relationships since high school, so I've never really done the adult dating thing. I recently got out of my last one in the summer, and started casually dating in the fall. I've been having a lot of fun going on dates. For a while it was a string of first-dates and nothing serious, but recently I've been seeing a guy for a month and it's been going really well.

I enjoy spending time with him including going for dinners as we both are foodies, cooking dinner at his place, going out to the bar with his friends, that kind of thing. This past weekend he was acting off-standish and today he said that it bothered him that I rarely offered to pay. I mean I've paid for coffees and movie tickets and a few ones offs but when I thought about, I never did the whole fumbling-with-my-wallet thing very much. He would usually pick it up, but didn't say much after that. We talked it over and I told him of course I would pay for my share from now on. I wasn't even aware of it - I guess in my eyes, we weren't exclusive and if he wanted me to pick up my tab, he would have asked for separate bills or something to the tune of, ""Let's split it."" I would have been more than happy to - I'm not going out with him for the free ride.

I wanted to get some perspective from outsiders: is there a timeline when the girl should start paying? Is it right away, or after a month? Or totally depends on the guy?

Short story and context:

Girlfriend is here on a working holiday visa that was recently renewed. To renew said visa we had to call in a favor from a friend. Girlfriend being the trusting type she is told people she was close to including roommate (who up until recently was our friend) about the details of this process.

Situation in the house has been gradually deteriorating for a number of weeks due to silly reasons. Finally we decided to leave and look for our own place. Girlfriends birthday is coming up soon and I decided id like to throw a birthday party for her before leaving. Roommate was totally opposed to the situation, saying there was no day over the next 2 weeks this would be permissible because he had work and other plans blah blah blah. Situation escalated when he started aggressively demanding his way and I called him a tyrant. 

He threatened that if we even so much as have a single person over without his permission he'll go to immigration and try have her deported.

TITLE: Reddit, a girl with a fake facebook identity is seducing unknown people on facebook for no reason. What should I do?

POST: So I was added as a friend on Facebook by a girl who looked very cute, but I didn't know her. I asked how she knew me, and she said she had made a mistake, and mid apology threw in, ""you look cute."" Basically we texted back and forth for a few days, and she was extremely, extremely flirty. My suspicious were halted when she would talk to me for 3-4 hours a night on the phone and text me virtually all day. 

I was suspicious, but she had a few hundred friends, a twitter account with a bunch of followers that tweeted at her, etc. It seemed legit, but I noticed one too many red flags.

Long story short, I got suspicious enough I did a few reverse image searches on Google, and sure enough she is using a fake name, has real pictures, but fake info, and has added enough friends to look legitimate. This is truly a work of art. She claimed to live about 45 minutes from me, go to my University, work in a city about an hour away, and even knew a bunch of stuff about our supposed mutual church, etc. Now I realize she lives in Texas, is in a sorority, and it's all lies.

TITLE: My ex (F21) just broke up with me (M23) because she needed to find herself. But I still want her - how do I eventually get her back?

POST: So I (M23) had been dating her (F21) for two years. Recently, she had become immature and rude to me. She then went back to the US for Christmas break and days before she returned, she said she had to tell me something. She got back and said she went to a party, got black out drunk and was taken advantage of. I believe my ex 100%, but I feel this was just something extra she did to push her over the edge, to give her that excuse to say what she ultimately wanted which was to break up with me. Her rudeness and immaturity that had ""developed"" wasn't enough to push me away so that I would do the break up, so I guess I interpret this event of her getting taken advantage of as her excuse so that she could do it. When she told me this, I realised she was PARTLY the victim here and was turning to forgive her. But then I asked her if she still loved me and she said she didn't know. She said her views on what love were had changed, she didn't think it existed anymore and she felt she had completely changed. She said she had to find herself, go travelling, see the world and get some perspective. She comes from a very messed up family and suffers with anxiety issues so I understand that she needs to figure that out before she can be with someone. But I am not just losing my girlfriend, I am losing my best friend too and I do not want to lose both. I would love for her to come back to me as my girlfriend but obviously not until she has found herself. Can I still be friends with her while she tries to find herself? I don't want to completely lose her. If anyone has any like 5 steps plans or strategies, please, I would really appreciate it. And also, for those who want to call me a pussy or are just going to insult me, please don't, I'm having a hard enough time as it is, and please just constructive advice. Thank you.

POST: So she decided we needed some time and space from me on the weekend I was planning to propose (she didn't know about my plans), we got to talking about our relationship and some issues that had been swept under the rug for a while finally came to light on both our ends. After 2 weeks of space and time I started reaching out to try and work things out, she said she needed more time I said we should work on things together, after a bit of a discussion she decided if I can't give her the time and space then it's over and broke up with me. It's been a total of 6 weeks including the time a day space. We've stayed in contact the whole time and some days she seems to be hinting at getting back together and other days she's very standoffish and says we'll never get back together, just give up hope. With all the back and forth, I heard she was dating someone now so I asked and she said she's not, she's just friends with a guy but they're talking a lot and getting to know each other but that's it. Then the next day she's telling me how much she loves me and got upset that I deleted our pics off social media (yet she had unfriended me weeks ago). She says she wants to keep a friendship with me but I told her I can't, not with how in love I still am and specially not if she's talking to someone else because I think it's BS she won't try to fix things with me, but is willing to give someone else her time and attention.

POST: Hey all,

I wanted to start a legitimate conversation about how coders view project managers and why they have those views. I am coming to the end of my senior year and I begin grad school in August where my focus will be in project management within the information technology realm. 

I myself have some background in coding (Java, Javascript, C, C#, VB .NET, some HTML / ASP .NET, SQL / MySQL) but not enough interest, drive, or skill to go out and do what you all do. I feel I have always been more of a people driven worker, and my passion for technology has helped me to decide to stay involved with it; this is why I landed in the world of Project Management. However, it disturbs me to see how many members of project teams despise their managers. 

I am asking you all this because I am finally able to start putting work in to really accelerate my learning in this sector, and one of the things I strongly believe in is getting information from the source. So I'm ask you all now;

What do you think of your P.M.'s? Why do you think it? What would you suggest to make them better? 

I'm doing this so  when my time comes, I can be the best manager possible, so please no flaming.

TITLE: What the hell can I do?

POST: I teach art lessons to underprivileged youths at a nearby elementary school through an organization at my university. After only ever teaching in middle/upper class areas, working with these kids has been a very eye-opening experience. I'll cut to the chase though... Today was my last day working with this particular class of kids, and one table started talking about when they were afraid of their parents. Two girls admitted that their parents regularly belted them, with one also saying her dad whipped her with metal wire, too, and the other saying her dad pounded her hand with a brick. When I tried to tell them that it was wrong for their parents to hurt them and told them it's illegal, they disagreed and thought it wasn't illegal. Yet another started crying when she got a somewhat poor progress report she had to take home for her parents to sign, saying her dad was going to beat her like he usually did. A different girl also told me that her mom calls her a ""fat bitch"" and that her dad was deported and went to jail after trying to kill her mother.

I asked the graduate student who serves as supervisor of the other undergraduate mentors like me what, if anything, I should do. Her exact words were, ""If you didn't see bruises, you can't say shit."" In a sad way I agree, and I realize I also have no proof that these kids are telling the truth, although they seemed serious. But thinking about some man taking a brick to a 9 year-old girl just makes me sick.
So I thought I'd ask you, Reddit. What can or should I do? I need some peace of mind.

Let me try and give you some background.

I am an 18 year old senior that had a chance to go to MIT full ride. I'm reasonable intelligent, 5;10, lithe wiry musculature, 140 lbs. I play sports, I did martial arts, I took advanced placement classes and I was friends with everyone. I did not date because I kept telling myself there was no one I really liked. That is what helped bring this all to a head.

It's not that there wasn't a girl that I liked enough to date, it's that there wasn't a single person around me who I could open up to. Who I could explain that I was a fake. That I lied about my childhood to everyone. That I lied about my adolescence to everyone. I've had plenty of friends, if you can call them that. I've had flings with women, if you can call them flings. I've been the life of the party and the main actor in a spotlight.

I've never been me.

Moving on now to the internet, I've been browsing for about eight years now. I was the generic kiddo on the internet for the first four. I quickly grew tired and developed yet another false identity.

I was a 16 year old Asian girl that went to my school for years. Some of my friends still don't know mostly because we haven't talked in a while. I took on a maternal role for a forum, quickly becoming a therapist in a sense. People would come to me and ask me for life advice and other nonsense and I would lie to them about who and what I was and give them their idiotic advice. Some would come back with success stories. Others would come back for more advice.

I'm really just rambling now and have no clue where i wanted to take this.

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my parents [50s M/F]. Father is emotionally abusive to my mother-questions

POST: Sorry for wall of text.

This is an issue that has been ongoing for most of my life. My father, while incredibly successful and a great provider, has always been emotionally abusive to my mother. Luckily it has never turned physical (AFAIK), but whenever I visit home, I hear my father scream at and berate my mother for every little thing. For example, my father is an incredibly reckless driver. Whenever my mother comments on something he did that was unsafe, it turns into 2 hours of him screaming at her for constantly criticizing him. He also screams at me and my siblings about mundane things e.g. not cleaning something properly, dropping something, not using utensils correctly (?? who knows).

I'm at a loss at what to do. I absolutely adore my mother and my father is enjoyable to be around when he is not angry, but I'm tired of seeing her screamed at by him. Whenever I bring up this issue, she always tells me that he is working on his temper and has other good qualities. However, my mother consistently tells me that he wasn't like this when she married him and if she had known how he would turn out, she wouldn't have.

I've already told her that when I have children I will be extremely hesitant to leave them alone with my parents. Their relationship has affected my own views on relationships greatly. Beyond that, I'm not sure what I can do. Cut off all contact until she leaves him? Just continue to ignore it for the rest of my life? I have no idea what the protocol is for situations like this.

Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated. I'm tired of being a passive bystander.

POST: This happened last summer at UConn. I live in Connecticut.

My bestfriend has a girlfriend, who has an apartment at UConn. I like to drink and got really drunk walking around after we tried to sneak into a bar without paying the upfront tab.

We tried to get in through the kitchen. It smelt like buffalo wings, I led the way.

Non-sequitur. 

We got kicked out almost immediately. Being my drunk self, I lost my friends and made new friends, which I believe were frat boys. 

Drunk dancing like the left shark in the Super Bowl and started talking to hot black girls. They say they have a lesbian friend. Drunk JJ only hears Barney Stinson(I love HIMYM) say ""Make a lesbian straight. Legen-dary."" 

Meet lesbian friend, hook up and dance, fall in drunken love with a girl who is cool. For the first time in my life, my hook up meant something. We talked and I actually liked this girl. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later to a random dorm. She's hooking up with another random dude. And another dude. 

She hooked up with 3 other dudes after me. I don't think she was a lesbian. 

Drunk JJ doesn't care. She jumps on my lap and starts kissing me again after these other dudes. I liked it till I get that I'm being played.

My heart was broken until I realized there's a lot of lesbians I can turn straight. 

After leaving this random dorm, I got attacked by a deer. A deer in the middle of UConn's campus jumped me. I ran away and lived to tell this story to reddit.

Unfortunately it started raining so we took shelter under a little poolside gondola that fitted two people. The two of us were sitting and talking and having a nice time when a tennis ball bounced over to us. I noticed a group of about five boys around the age of 12 looking at me so I assumed they had accidentally overthrown it and rolled the ball back to them. 

Two minutes passed and another ball flies up to me. Again I rolled it back. After the third ball I knew something was up and I started to watch as the boys would wait until we weren't looking and throw a ball at us and then run up and retrieve it. After multiple throws, one of the balls flew up and smacked my girlfriend right in the chest. I threw all of the tennis balls I collected over the fence and glared at the laughing kids. 

The lifeguard walked up to us with a smile and told us to let her know if they threw another ball because she would love to kick them out. She also mentioned that she had berated the kids. 

Two of the kids came up and gave us a meek apology but my petty revenge was already plotted. The kids had not thrown a ball after the lifeguard's talk but on our way out we stopped by her stand and told her how they threw more balls at us. My girlfriend and I watched triumphantly as their pool day came to a sudden close.

When we walk down the street,  almost every guy we walk past checks her out. She doesn't notice this. My guy friends have all let me know I'm pretty lucky to have found a girl as good looking as her. Her female friends are jealous of her body. Her bi friend has even expressed interest in having sex with her!

Am I right to be concerned that she's going to have no qualms about trying even harder stuff I.e heroin, crack, meth?

TITLE: Hotel room next door won't turn down their TV...

POST: I moved into a super crappy extended stay hotel for a week because my apartment lease ran up on friday and I can't move into my new place until Wednesday. Horrible management, ghetto furniture, weird smell, half working heater, but whatever I'm a single guy right? Suck it up, save a few bucks by staying in a cheapo place.
We'll along with all that are paper thin walls and a horrible neighbor that moved in yesterday. They have a dog that barked all day yestersay and when they finally got home they turned their TV volume way up. I went and knocked on their door twice asking to turn it down with no result. Didn't get to sleep until 1 when they finally turned it off.

Cut to today, I've had 3 more hours of dog barking until they got home and then dancing with the stars cranked way up followed by what I think is Nancy Grace coverage of Furgeson and they won't even answer the door this time. I'm done at this point so I hooked up my laptop, maxed the TV and hit play on a 30 minute Nyan Cat loop. I'm ready to fight dirty. Up next is heavy metal from my high school days. 

Muted the TV at the end of typing this, I've won! They turned it down!

TITLE: Studying in Madrid this July, have a free week after. What should I do?

POST: Basically, as the title says, I'll be studying in Madrid this coming July through a program with my (American) university. 

I have a free week after and am trying to figure out how I would best spend it. I realize it's not a lot of time, but I'd like to hear what you would do if you had an extra week.

I'll probably have seen enough of Spain (and a little bit of Portugal, probably) to be happy, so I'm thinking of traveling elsewhere in Europe. However, I'm a Brazilian citizen, which probably doesn't affect much, but it's worth considering if I have to cross borders. 

I don't expect to go backpacking/hiking/scuba-diving or anything like that in such a short amount of time, but I'd be very happy being a ""fish out of water."" I love beaches and mountains, really any scenery or cities would be cool with me. 

Basically, this would just be a good way for me to whet my appetite with a little bit of Europe. Probably I have enough time to explore maybe two cities or so counting travel, maybe see a good museum or two and eat some interesting food. 

If you have suggestions (anybody know anything about getting into the Paris tunnels?) about any thing that I just **need** to see/visit/eat/dance or something, I'd love to hear it. Also, my birthday falls during this free week, and I don't know if I'll have any companions with me as of yet, but anything I could do to celebrate my birthday would be cool as well.

TITLE: My [19F] FWB [23 M] secretly took screenshots of my nudes. I want them deleted, he said no. What do I do?

POST: Throwaway account. I have never posted on Reddit ever so please be gentle on the formatting! I am trying my best.

I met Nick* on Tinder. I was just checking it out for fun, my best friend loved and used it etc. I met up with him and we just hung out. He's a nice guy and I just had broken up with my ex. So we became friends with benefits.

Since I left that summer for college, we just sext a lot. And often it was just texting but sometimes he would ask me for some pictures and I was naive  so I thought a 3 second picture on snapchat should get the job done and keep me safe.

Three months into this; snapchat notified me with the little triangle symbol that he had screenshoted it. And I **FLIPPED OUT**. I told him it made me uncomfortable and so the next time we met up, I had him deleted them off his computer. And I thought he understood that I didn't like the fact that he saved the pictures. He said he would stop. 

Recently, we met up and I asked him if he saved any of the pictures. And he said that he didn't. However, I saw on his phone that he had one of the apps that allows you to secretly screenshot snaps without letting the other person know.  

When he returned, I asked again. And he said maybe he saved a few and that he only did it because he really liked them and he saved them for fun. I begged him to delete the pictures and he said no. So I left. And he deleted me off snapchat. 

This guy that I trusted, has nudes of me. I am terrified and I understand I should never ever taken them in the first place. But I never thought he would be this kind of person. He was so sweet in the beginning. I fear he'll share them and ruin my career. I had a nightmare last night that he had cameras in his bedroom and that he has videos too. I don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR:",  My FWB secretly took nudes of me. He said he would delete them but I saw evidence of him saving them. I want them deleted. He said no. I am terrified and don't know what to do anymore.,  Sexted with a fwb on snapchat; he refuses to delete them. I am in fear of him distributing them. How do I convince him to delete them?

TITLE: Guilt about loans: holding me back, or keeping me from being a moron (again)?

POST: I graduated college with no debt 5 years ago (majored in English Literature, mistake number one), then threw that all in the garbage by taking out a large student loan to start a graduate program I subsequently quit.

I have been working whatever part-time jobs come my way since then. I promised myself that if I ever go back to school, I would save up my money first and pay my own way because I felt so stupid about being in debt with this loan for no reason.

But I have recently decided what I want to do with my life. I want to go back to school to get started on this path, but my current job pays less than 10 dollars an hour and I can't imagine how long it would take to save up enough money to really get started.

Should I go ahead and take out loans to finance my education now that I know what I want to do? Or is my guilt and hesitancy about debt rational? I know I'm miserable right now, but nothing is guaranteed and I feel like I may just be setting myself up for more misery and even deeper debt down the road if I still can't find a decent job later on (I want to go back to school to become a teacher and I know sometimes it's difficult for new teachers to find work). I really can't see finding a stable decent job with the degree I already have. I'd appreciate any advice.

TL;DR:","  Graduated college with no debt, took out a large student loan to go to grad school, now regretting it. Should I take out more loans to finance my education now or is my guilt irrational?","  Paying off a loan for a degree I never got, now I want to go back to school but I would need to take out more loans.

TITLE: Me (25F) and my guy (25M) of 6 years are in a bit of a huge argument due to another girl who has caused problems before.

POST: Let's see my ex SO of 5 years and I have been trying to work things out, but there are some factors that pretty much scream RUN. It starts off during the middle of our relationship when he talked to this girl during us dating, it caused us to break up because I would constantly bitch to him about how its fucked up he is talking to another girl so much. It turn out that I was right in the end about them ""talking"". Well we got back together not too long after I found out, because he was begging and promising that he did not know what he was doing and that he would drop it and I was in a tough place because I lost someone(death). Well years have passed, and we had broken up again. This time he told me that he had liked her, months later we started to try and rekindle things and then I saw him talking to her again, but he claimed he was fighting with her because she was talking to a kid he did not like. I asked him why he cared so much, and he said it was because she was his friend and he despises the kid. Which I know it total bullshit, but yet we were still trying to work on things. After months have passed, we still are trying until he started hanging out at her house, and she has been attending parties at his with her boyfriend and all because they all have mutual friends. He will talk to her, and continue to hang with her and friends. This is all no problem since we are technically not together. The issue is he does not understand why I would not be with him if he was friends with her, and he thinks it would be okay to be friends with this girl if we did get back together. Can someone give me their opinion as to what you think about all that?

TITLE: Me [24F] with my bf [24M] of 2 years are having issues because of my personal problems

POST: I have a history of ending relationships out of nowhere. I'm not entirely sure why besides that I just get scared of the commitment that comes with long term relationships.

As of recently, I have just been feeling really not myself. I have good days and I have bad days where I feel really low. On the good days I'm convinced that I'm just being weird and that it will pass. On bad days I feel really negative and agitated.

As of recently the low days are outnumbering the good days. I feel very irritable and I feel so bad for how my bf has to deal with it. I sometimes don't feel like being touched. He is so loving and just wants to be near me and snuggle all the time but it just makes me push him away and get agitated. The more I push the more he tries to fix it and by being more loving.

I have zero sex drive and I end up declining his advances because I never feel up to it. We talked last night and he said he feels like I don't care about him as much anymore. That broke my heart because i feel absolutely terrible with how I have been treating him.. being distant and not wanting to have sex. And I know he has to feel that way based off of how I act but I am having a hard time dictating how I feel and why.

I don't think it is the relationship unless I just don't like being smothered with attention but it feels more than that. I quit my recent job because it was too emotionally draining and I feel like I want something but I just can't put my finger on what.

POST: I met a girl on OKCupid. We met up, clicked, and have been out around 10 times together now. We both live at our respective homes, me as I pay off my student loans, whereas she is a commuter at her university. 

We've expressed multiple times how it would be great to actually finish a date and spend the night together but sadly it just hasn't happened yet. We are exclusively seeing one another and I'm very happy.  

I am in a situation I've never been in before, as she is a very independent girl and I'm used to ones that are more communicative and open with what they are feeling and doing. I have a hard time trying to figure out what is going on in her mind. Because of this, I'm not sure if I'm being too distant or too clingy when I message her or see her. 

Can anyone else who has been in this situation before, shed some light on what they did to put themselves at ease while seeing someone independent? I like this girl a lot but don't want to scare her off by encroaching on her ""me"" time.

TITLE: (M/17) How to let go of a shitty friend (F/15)?

POST: I been friends with this cute girl for about a  2 years now. Although I am somewhat a little romantically in love with her (we hold hands, cuddle at home, give light kisses to each other but not  in the lips), I still get jealous when she hangs around with guys and does stuff without me. Although I care for her deeply.

So far she's been doing stuff that I don't agree with which includes doing illegal drugs, drinking alcohol excessively, having sex with other girls, and hanging out with the wrong type of people like the druggie, gang-banger, shady type of people. I feel like telling her parents or reporting her to the police for drug possession so that she can stop endangering herself with these type of people, since she is and acts far too young to be doing all this.

Even though she is one of my best friends and I tell her to stop doing these things but she goes on how I'm being a too much of a ""goody goody"" in her words, I no longer want to be associated with this type of person, but I cannot help my self to break contact with her since I see her everyday at school, we talk almost everyday, she lives near me, and she is the closest I ever had to a girlfriend. 

What can I do to ensure that I can successfully break away from her? And should I tell her parents about his?

TITLE: My girlfriends Bday is coming up. I have access to a 3D printer. IDEAS!?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months and her b-day is coming up. I'd like to do something special for her. It's been a huge struggle to figure out what to buy/make for her as a present because she literally doesn't want ANYTHING. She is a very charitable person and is always looking into volunteering and donating. At first I was thinking of donating to a charity/organization of her choice, but I decided that I actually want to do something instead (or maybe along with donating). I have access to a 3D printer that my buddy owns so I was thinking of making something using that. However there are a couple of problems which is why I am making my plea to you redditors!

1) I have no artistic capabilities and can not graphically design anything. Thus it must be something that already exists (for example things from thingiverse.com) (Or if one of you amazing redditors can make me something that would be beyond amazing!)

2) I want it to be thoughtful and a tiny bit cheesy, but something that tailors to her charitable, nice, intelligent traits.

3) I have about 20 days to make and paint whatever object I decide upon.

Here are a few ideas I saw on thingiverse.com that caught my eye:
[Heart and Key](

[Nice Bracelet](

[Twisty Bracelet](

I looked around for a good subreddit for this and I feel like this is somewhat of a thought-provoking question, hence why I posted it here.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my close friend [31 F] became intimate but now things are awkward.

POST: So I have been in a serious long term relationship for 4 years with my girlfriend and by serious I mean I am thinking about proposing within the next year.  However, about 2 years ago I met a really amazing girl, lets call her C.  C and I have been getting closer - we text regularly, are able to make fun of each other like I do with my bros, and we usually go out for drinks at least once a week (i let my gf know this of course).  We really connect as we have the same career (finance) and she is one of the more interesting individuals i have ever met and understands me (very few people do as I think I am quite complicated).  Anyways, the other night we went out for drinks and ended up at her place.  We had a few more drinks and we end up making out - this was one of the most passionate make-out sessions I've had in a long time.  The next morning, we sober up a bit and now things are a bit awkward and I feel like shit for cheating.  She says to me that if I have no intention of being with her, its best that we don't see each other anymore. She's out of town for the weekend as she has family matters to attend to and we will talk when she's back.  

I know this is selfish but I don't want to lose C as a friend and also don't want to break up with my current gf.  I'm aware that it's not fair to C but it feels like my best friend just suddenly died.  I'm not sure which direction to go ie 

1) break up, date C

2) Never talk or see C again

3) Do shit all and go with the flow

Any advice on what to say when I meet up with C or advice on what to do is appreciated, thanks.

So now, every time I'm in the bathroom, I always make sure to pick a bunch of my loose hair on the ground and then throw it away.

I don't manage to pick up each and every loose strand in the bathroom and that's what he finds unacceptable. The bathroom floor has to be completely free of my hair but the problem is I shed a lot and so often that I can't be spending all of my time cleaning up all my hairs.

POST: Obviously, it can't be all that repressed if I'm making a thread about it right now. The anonymity helps me to speak about it more openly, I believe.

From that Nerdy Nummies chick on YouTube to pretty much 90% of the women I've raided with in WoW. Even the woman that I play with in league and know IRL irritate me greatly, even though I'd never admit it out loud.

The only motive I can think up that would make me so upset is that they are applauded for embracing their ""geekdom"" while most males are criticized. Which is pretty stupid since I like women and playing with them should be enjoyable. They tend to have pleasing voices and be more willing to play support roles(100% personal experience).

POST: Been seeing this girl for about a month, but we're not committed because I told her I'm not ready. She wants to be in a committed relationship. 

She's had enough experience to know she won't have sex until then, which is okay with me (though not how I usually do it). 

We have a lot in common: get along, have similar interests, etc. She's pretty cute and just finished grad school. I guess she fits the bill.

But I'm just not that excited about it. Lukewarm.

Back in January I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 months for the same reason, and a year ago I did the same with a girl of 2 months. All 3 girls wanted to keep dating me. 

There have been a few girls I've been excited about after a date or two, but they weren't that into me.

I'm afraid I'm victim to the old Groucho Marx quote, ""I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.""

These girls are catches and I'm beating myself up for not being that into them.

Maybe this is normal and just called dating. Should I break up with current girl right now?

POST: I (male, 26) have a very good friend (female, 25) that I've recently gotten much closer to. Over the past month and a half or so we've come to realize that we are able to communicate and understand each other on a deeper level than with anyone else. We are incredibly similar, in all of the ways that truly matter. We see each other usually a few times a week, and talk every day, for most of the day, including at night for several hours. 
We're also both physically attracted to one another, but she is just coming off of a breakup with a long term partner, and I am recently divorced, so we don't want to do anything with one another right now. But the desire is there.

The thing is, though, that we both agree...we don't feel like we want to be in a romantic relationship with one another. We don't want to ""date"". It seems...weird to us. 

So my question is, what is this relationship? If we get along so well, have such a profound connection, spend so much time together, and are physically attracted to each other, why do we not feel like we want to date each other?

A few months ago, my job offered me the opportunity to work in his city, for 5 months. One week before I left, I contacted him and asked him out; he didn't know I was there. He accepted and we stayed like 6 hours to talk without any sexual or romantic topic. 

At the end of the ""date"" he asked me when I'm coming back and he said that ""now you have my number, you can call me at any time"". And I told him that maybe we will see each other again and he said ""of course we will"" and that's it, he hadn't contacted me since and I don't know if I shoud do it, but I dont wanna push things... 

Now a little of myself: I'm recently out of a 5 year relationship and planned to relocate in that city and I feel stuck with this guy in my mind, because he is as I always known him: smart, interesting, people person, handsome etc. 

The relocation means professional oportunities for me, but I'm not sure my boss will let me go and lately I also consider relocation for this guy but when I try to conclude things, I get extremely confused because I'm not sure he likes me more than an old internet buddy

TL;DR:","  Went out with this guy for 6 hours, everything went well, he gave me his number and said we will see each other again, but I'm not sure if he likes me more than an old internet buddy.","  In love with an old friend, living in different cities, not sure if he REALLY likes me and I consider relocation there, so where do I go from here ?

TITLE: I [24M] am afraid to become over-attached to [22F]

POST: We have dated for 5 month now and she is my official GF for 1,5month and I am afraid I might get over-attached and that I am turning into someone I do not want to be. One example, an old-highschool friend visited her and they went out partying (I went somewhere else) and he spent the night at her place (we dont live together and he doesnt live close). I am totally okay with that and I know that since she only has one huge bed and no couch that he slept in one bed with her. I trust her and I know that she would never cheat on me but still I become paranoid. She accidentally called me by his name today (and she was so embarrassed and sorry) and that freaked me the fuck out. I know that she loves me a lot and she told me that she never felt that much in love before and I believe her. Why do I still become paranoid? I couldnt sleep tonight because I was creating scenarios in my head in which she cheated on me or something else bad happened.

Do I have self-esteem issues or something?

I am someone who needs a lot of freedom in relationships. If I wanted to visit a female friend and platonically spend the night and I couldn't because my GF wouldnt let me, I would be so annoyed, so it seems just natural to me to give her the same freedom I am expecting of her but why can't I just be cooler about this? It feels like my emotional shields protecting me from my own paranoia are completely shut down. It feels a little like I am tripping out on MDMA or something.

TITLE: Mediocre problem with my ""girlfriend"" or whatever you may call it.

POST: So.. this seems like a very mediocre problem but it has been bothering me for the longest time.

1. We've been together for about four months. 
2. She isn't my girlfriend. She says she doesn't like the title of being a girlfriend and that her first boyfriend was awful. So she was only ""dating"" the previous ""boyfriends"" she has had. (So technically she has only had 1 boyfriend and the other guys were just relationships)
3. She never has time or makes the time (She says she's incredibly busy). We probably hang out about every two weeks unless I push hard for some time to hang out. 
4. I don't know what else. She's someone I thought I would actually like and it kind of just happened. Before, she used to think I was this cool, super outgoing person (things she said before I had an interest in her) while she was this super shy girl (who actually seemed to waver on the social side). But now I'm interested in her in ways I never would've thought because of her personality and her drive and how different and unique she is to just about any other girl I have ever dated. 
5. I'm also afraid that maybe we moved too fast. Was sex on first date bad? Did it make it so it becomes hard to build a relationship since there was no tension building up on it?
6. She has never introduced me to anybody and shoos me out whenever she is expecting anybody. 
*I just want to build that she is the type that spent her life alone from middle school to high school. Would this be the reason she treats me so? 
7. Am I just a fuck buddy to her?

The real question I'm asking is whether she isn't making the time for me because she genuinely doesn't have an interest for me and I should end the relationship or make some kind of ultimatum. Or if it is because she really is busy and really doesn't expect much time out of our relationship but she actually does hold an interest. We also live only about 3 blocks away from each other.

TL;DR:",  Been with my girlfriend for 4 months. She says she doesn't like the title of being a girlfriend and is super busy. Is she not making time for me because she doesn't have an interest in me?,  In a relationship with girl; not girlfriend. Doesn't show any interest and never has time. Has sex a lot. Is she into me or am I just a fuck buddy?

TITLE: [25/m] Enamored of my best friend's sister [21/f]

POST: Using a throwaway just to be safe. Mostly.

I've known one of my friends for around 10 years, and though we no longer live near each other, I make an effort to spend time with her a few times a year. She's practically a sister to me. In that time I've become close to her family, including one of her sisters, let's call her Olivia.

Olivia may or may not have been fond of me for some time. In recent years, my friend sent me teasing texts like, ""When are you visiting again? Olivia misses you."" At the time, I liked Olivia as much as one likes any annoying-but-somehow-endearing younger sisters of your best friend, so I rolled my eyes and humored her. I figured it was a phase, and it probably was.

Well, as it happens, I hate myself; Olivia has grown on me. After teasing Olivia through her college years for being in a related discipline embroiled in a conflict with my own, she switched to my major. Funny, that. Having the ability to share in obtuse conversations certainly enabled us to spend more time together, and I find myself stupidly grinning at even the worst of her puns.

Fast forward to the present. Olivia and I are both graduating in the spring. Part of me knows that keeping my mouth shut is the safer course of action, and much of this could just be me projecting, but I still want to open up to my friend before we all part ways. I'm trying to conceive how best to broach the topic with her, as it's going to be awkward regardless. I know all the risks involved, and I even considered the cataclysmic scenario in which it's my friend and not her sister who has feelings for me, which is ridiculous, but you know what they say about truth and fiction.

POST: I'm extremely worried about my opinions on anything related to music, movies, books, shows, or otherwise related to matters of taste and culture.  I'm worried that I'll say the wrong thing and that what I like or dislike will somehow reflect negatively on my intelligence or worth.  There's a sizeable chunk of the internet that seems to hold an unwritten notion that the minority of smart people like one set of things and the ""idiot masses"" like another set of things and never the twain shall meet.  I don't know if I'm smart or if I'm part of the ostensibly vast masses of idiots that are, according to various rants I've read, apparently responsible for the death of culture and the plummeting quality of everything.

TITLE: Carpooling is financially beneficial, but I can't deal with my coworker all day long every day

POST: My coworker and I have to drive to a city over an hour away every day for work. So financially it makes sense for us to take turns driving. The problem is, I can't stand this guy all day long. I come home from work every day exhausted--not from the work but from being around my coworker for the whole day.

He talks too much, either about meaningless bullshit or really, really weird things for which there are no good responses. He complains all the time about who's not doing enough work or how others are doing their jobs, etc, no matter how many times I tell him to quit worrying about everyone else and just do his own work. And this is all made worse by the fact that we have to get up really early to be at work on time and I do not do well with that.

Frankly, it'd be worth the financial hit to not have to spend every day with this guy.

TITLE: Can I refuse to sign an amendment to my Employer contract which was not pre-agreed? (Location: UK - Wales)

POST: What are my options in relation to changes being made to my employment contract? Can I refuse to sign something I did not agree to without it affecting my employment?

Background:
My employer pays for our exams and training. It has not been stated that we would need to repay these costs until recently. It was announced last month  (2 days after I booked my next exam) that we would be liable to repay costs in the event we leave the company within 36 months of the cost being incurred. Today we have been given a document stating it's an amendment to our contract amednmnd the changes are to be implemented immediately.

My problem is I have an interview lined up 31 March. I've had a first interview with the company (1 march) and they have called me back for a second interview. 

I calculate the costs I would owe my current employer as £530. I only earn £1,106 at present and cannot afford to lose that amount from my pay or I cannot afford to pay my half of the bills/rent and my SO wouldn't have the available funds to help me out.

Can I refuse to sign this document? What is the smartest move here considering I did not agree to these costs prior to taking the exams and certainly wouldn't have sat them if I had known?

My issue is that I don't want to kick up a fuss and create tension if I don't end up getting the job. But on the other hand, the interview is promising (I have a friend at the company and the Directors I've already met have apparently gone up to her and told her how impressed hey were... so I'm hopeful).

I think that's enough info.... but happy to expand if necessary. New job would be a  £4,500 pay increase; walking distance so less fuel costs; less travel time etc.

Here comes the winter break, and 2 weeks later we've hung out twice. Once with all of our friends, and once just the two of us (we didn't talk about us just had lunch and caught up. It went well and i even noticed she's still wearing a ring i gave her on our 2 year anniversary). 

Now though, I asked her if we could talk yesterday and she didn't respond at all and it's almost like she's avoiding talking about it. Today, she wasn't in a good mood when i texted her to see if we can meet and talk about us. Caught off guard, i told her if she didn't want to talk about it right now, i'd back off.

TITLE: I [20 M] can't help being jealous of my best friend [20 M] and it's hurting our relationship

POST: My best friend from high school, let's call him Harry, is really successful. Like, ridiculously so. Self-made multi-millionaire at 20 after starting his own business at 18 while also graduating from university 2 years early. We were rivals in a bunch of things at school, and it wasn't a problem, but had a big fight when I was rejected from my first-choice university after Harry also applied and got in with a very similar resume, even though he had no intention of going. We made up, and later he offered me a chance to join him in starting his business (part-time while studying), but I declined.

In hindsight, I think that not putting enough effort into university applications and not being willing to commit to the work associated with a start-up are two of the worst decisions I've made. I'm fairly high-achieving by most standards: have ended up at a top university anyway, getting good grades, currently working a well-paid internship, etc. Of course it's difficult not to be comparative, but by itself the fact that I'm jealous of Harry is something I think I can deal with. What's making it really problematic that his successes are closely correlated with my own biggest regrets. Since we're living in different countries right now, it takes some effort to Skype and stay in contact; but because of those associations and the emotional response I get when thinking about them, I'm increasingly hesitant to do so (he talks about his academic and corporate work a fair bit, since they're very big parts of his life right now), and have to focus on pushing down those feelings when we're talking. Of course this is my problem not his, and I'm not sure it's the sort of thing I'd want to discuss with him, but I'm wondering how people would recommend dealing with this.

POST: Fairly new Redditor here, and a private person so posting something like this should show the level of lost I'm at...also sorry if format is wonky. 

Anyway, had a relationship with an awesome girl starting Jr year of college and extending through 3 years after graduation. A little bickering but no big fights and we got along really well 95% of the time. We had moved in together, both had stable jobs and were engaged to be married in 7 months time. (Had been engaged about a year at this point.)

One night she wakes me up 1-2 AM and simply says ""I'm done."" No clue or hints leading up to it, just two words, goes downstairs to sleep on the couch, and has packed essentials for a move to parents house while I am at work the next day. In 6 months she's married a new guy but claims all that happened ""after us."" Come to find out her parents resented me for... reasons (honestly never clear on the what or why) and basically had been telling her to do better for a few years. YEARS! 

So...it's two years later and I'm with a wonderful girl for almost a year now. Problem is I go into these funks where all I can think about is what I lost, what could I do different, etc. This sounds bad but probably 2-3 times a month I wake up and my first waking thought is crippling disappointment that she's not there next to me. I am 100% committed with my current girl, but deep deep down I don't know how I would feel if relationship prospects with the ex weren't 100% killed. How long (or how do I) get back to ""normal""? Any advice on ways to stop dreaming/imagining about the life we were planning?

For me the most important thing is not my job, I don't have the ambition to be in a super high paying job, I like having an average job if it means I have the energy and motivation to do that and extracurriculars.

POST: Her dog has been with her since it was 8 weeks old. He is always at her side and she spoils him.

He also has the bad habit of begging for food when we are eating because she gives him food from her plate. She believes dogs in nature just expect humans to share food with them and she is completely okay with letting him lick the plates and bowls clean ""if he didn't beg"". Which just means if he lays by her feet and stares at her, she will eventually give him food. How can I break this behavior?

He also doesn't use his dog bed to sleep in, instead he humps it. And she allows him to hump it. He humps sheets, pillows, anything and she doesn't scold him at all. I'm afraid to get a cat because he might start humping it.

Upon the front door opening he makes a break for it. He doesn't wait, doesn't hesitate. And just runs for it, which makes me afraid I might come home from work and he will run out and I'd have to chase him down.

He also barks randomly at random times even after being let out or played with. It's quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and he is barking up a storm and scratching the bed I'm sleeping on.

He sleeps on top of the couch and I try to make sure he stays off the furniture but according to her "" thats just what he does""

If he is on my bed or the couch he will also start trying to dig and I dont like him doing that to my sheets because he's a dog with nails and I don't want my sheets or couch ripped.

Every time I try to bring these issues up to her she tells me it's her dog, not to yell at him, don't push him down when he's jumping on things, etc.

POST: A bit of background on her: seventeen, in high school (as well as myself). Straight-A student, probably going Ivy League. Quiet around most people, loud and hyperactive around me. Likes to read. Popular, but I've noticed she seems to crave attention a lot -- she's a self-described 'camwhore' with a 'god complex', and I've seen her do various 4chan tinychats with thirty or forty guys, even though she was [doxed] once. I don't ever say anything about it, as it's her business. She was also homeschooled as a kid -- didn't go to public school until age fourteen.

She has panic attacks and cuts typically when her parents tell her she's doing something wrong, whether it's minor or not. She says she 'doesn't like to think [she] does things wrong, just different' and she 'wants them to know she cares.' I know she cuts because she sent me a picture. I deleted it, even though I know now I really shouldn't have.

I also know I have to tell someone, but I don't know who. Her parents wouldn't believe me, and she's convinced that cutting is the only way to release pain, so she won't get herself help. Can I help her? If so, whom should I go to?

Soon, we are cuddling on a nearby bench.

TITLE: Found out my (28F) best friend (29F) of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post. At a loss for words.

POST: First, the goods news. She is no longer living with cancer!

This morning when I woke up and for some reason grabbed my phone and checked Facebook immediately. I rarely do this. This first post I see is from my best friend announcing that today is a good day because she is cancer free. I was in shock because I didn't even know she had cancer!

Clearly she has her reasons for not sharing this information with me, but I feel like an absolutely terrible friend that she felt she could not tell me. Furthermore, I have known a lot of people to get cancer in the past 7 years, and I always would tell her ""so and so has cancer and I'm really sad, hoping she/he will get better soon"" and if I'd known she also had cancer I wouldn't have brought it up so much!

A bit of background on our friendship and why I feel I've been an insufficient friend to her:
We met in elementary school and were bffs. During my second year of high school, I had to move so we stopped seeing each other as much. We still hung out when we could and she was always my best friend. At the end of high school I started dating a guy who turned out to be abusive. We were together for 5 years, and throughout that time period he slowly isolated me from my friends and family, and said mean things about the people closest to me. (Things like my parents didn't really love me and other fucked up things.)

Anyway, I got out of that relationship, so i started hanging out with her more again. It was a relief to me that she didn't completely hate me for my time spent being distant. For the past five years we've lived in different cities, but we still see each other once in a while and write letters to each other. (We've always sent each other snail mail)

I'm currently working on a reply to one of her letters, but I don't know how to approach this topic, since I found out through social media and not a personal message. I already feel terrible that I haven't even sent her a text.

TL;DR:",  Found out my best friend of 20 years had cancer for the past 7 years through a Facebook post. Feeling terrible about it. How do I approach this topic in a way that doesn't come off as insensitive?,  My bff had cancer for years and I never knew. Feeling insecure and like a horrible friend. Not sure how to express to her how happy I am that she is OK.

TITLE: Me [23M] - cannot handle my friends [same age, M/F] hanging out with my parents

POST: Hi - kind of a weird question / situation. I'll try to be brief.

I am from country A, did high-school in country B, and am currently in the United States for college. My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.

The problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. 

I cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.

I remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.

So, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.

It's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.

TL;DR:",  My friends from country A are visiting country B and hanging out with my parents. I cannot handle it. I am experiencing FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. Anyone else been in this situation?,"  my parents are being awesome for showing my friends around while I'm not home, and I cannot deal with them having fun and literally creating memories in which I am not present or related to."

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] of almost 3 years, suggested taking a break?

POST: A large group of our friends are going to this weekend camping festival and due to the size of it and how we are all arriving on different days it is unlikely that I am sharing a tent with my girlfriend.

She recently suggested that we ""took a break"" for the festival. At first I was shocked and didn't know if it was because she didn't want to spend time with me, had stopped liking me and even wanting to go out getting with other boys.

I obviously said no and asked why she wanted that and she just said she trusted me however didn't trust my friends and thinks they would egg me on to get with other girls and fool around a bit.

I'm really confused about the whole situation, she says she was ""testing me"" to see if I would want to take a break however that feels like she doesn't trust me. Also I feel like maybe she doesn't like me as much as I thought seeing as she suggested we break up so I can fool around..

I'm really confused about this whole situation and just want some outsiders' opinions to sort of guide me through it.

POST: A little backstory from a post about a month ago 

So here is what's going on now. About a week ago, she took a break from her boyfriend. She came to my house and we fooled around for about 6 hours. It was amazing, but I feel like a horrible person for doing it. She says she loves me more than anything and wishes we were together, but she's too afraid to leave the position she's in now because it's ""too risky"". Now she's done with her break and she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I love her so much, I just don't know what to do anymore. I told her that it would be difficult being friends because at the end of the day, she'll be going home to her boyfriend and that's going to break my heart. Sorry guys, I feel like a total bitch looking for advice because I usually stray from this kind of drama that I somehow got sucked into. I just don't know what to do anymore. I guess I'm just hoping that thing don't work out for them, and that makes me feel incredibly selfish. Anyways, thanks for anything.

She told me she cried for an hour because of it and she has never had a break out this bad before. So she is on a ""Makeup Break"" I asked her how long and she said a week.

POST: My boyfriend is a horrendously picky eater, both when we cook at home (most of the week) and when we go out (once or twice a week). He'll eat only white chicken meat, steak, pizza, spaghetti or a hamburger. Green beans are the only veggie he'll touch, and he has to be vigorously persuaded to eat any fruits, after which he expects to be praised as if he's done something wonderful.

I'm an adventurous eater, and I work out hard during the day so that I can enjoy something I like for dinner. I love sushi, curries, gyro, pho, ramen, etc etc. Boyfriend won't even try any of these, for a plethora of excuses.

I'm fine if he contains his picky eating to himself, but I'm sick of always going to his restaurants because I can find something I'll tolerate on their menus, and he won't go near any of mine. I want to be able to cook more adventurously at home (usual menu is chicken breast, rice or potatoes, green beans- BORING) without him whining and just eating a muffin or frozen pizza instead. I'm worried about his health and I resent not being able to do something I enjoy.

In the past, we've had very nonconstructive conversations about this. He got defensive, I got snarky. I need a way to reframe the issue, maybe some scripting help or practical compromises. Any ideas?

POST: A bit of background on myself: I am a photographer by trade.  Somewhat as a joke, my girlfriend has always playfully been very against my taking photos of her.  It hurt and annoyed me at first when she played coy, but eventually I just stopped trying to involve her in my work.   

She is a very attractive girl - to the point of being openly approached constantly whenever she's out at no matter the setting (work, etc).  That said, she grew into her good looks and somewhat enjoys the attention she gets now.  Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup she is a fan of.  Excited with the idea, she agreed.

At the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.  The photographer inside me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her.  The boy in me is jealous that she is so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me (taking photos) initially.  I'm also just not that comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online - perhaps a bit possessive/insecure, but I just don't love the idea of her half naked all over the internet and lastly...

TITLE: Me [18 M] and my girlfriend [16 F] are going to sleep together for the first time. I'm anxious.

POST: I'm a very anxious person in general, sometimes to an obsessive degree.

We've been together for over two years without having sex. At first she was too young (14) and now she wants a time when she is free of stress so she can be relaxed and not have to worry about anything else. The.. event itself will take place in about a month, after she finishes her exams. We've considered it now and then through the time we've been together but always decides to wait.

Now it isn't being put off any longer. And, while it has been a TORTUROUS wait for me (worth it, to be with someone like her), it suddenly seems... rather sudden and immediate. 

God knows I want to, and I definitely don't want to wait any longer, but at the same time I don't know how I'm going to be fully ready by the time it happens. 

I understand on an intellectual level that it is not that big a deal. Just sex, right? But emotionally it seems like a great deal more than that.

And I know that it is for her. We're very open in discussing these matters. To her this is a really big deal; her virginity is something she can only ever give to one person and she wants it to be meaningful. It's sharing a more intimate part of herself than she ever has before.

I understand and even agree with her. But that kind of adds pressure to the situation. I don't want to screw up and make her first time something she doesn't want to remember. And I don't know if worrying about it will just make it more likely to happen.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking here. As much a chance to just talk about it as possible,I guess; my only confidante aside from my girlfriend is asexual, and as such she can't give much input here. But do I really have anything to worry about? Just how badly CAN I screw this up? And is there anything I definitely, definitely shouldn't do?

TL;DR:",  Going to sleep with my girlfriend for the first time. She wants it to be special and meaningful. I'm anxious and don't know how to handle it.

My roommate's high school band was traveling by bus to a school in a different city for a competition. Dave had been messing with the people in band all week and as a band member himself, would be accompanying them to the competition. The bus ride was going to take around 4-5 hours and a group of trombone guys (including my roommate) decided it would be a great opportunity to get back at Dave. They sneaked into the band room, opened Dave's trombone case, and stole his mouthpiece.

One by one, the guys took turns jacking off into it. One of the them stuck it up his ass. Another pissed on it.

They made sure to wipe off the more obvious fluids, but didn't rinse the thing out. Instead, they stuck it back into Dave's case and watched as it was loaded into the storage section under the bus. There, the mouthpiece sat. Did I mention it was May? It was fucking May. For 5 hours, that mouthpiece sat roasting in shit and piss and semen like a fetish-loving prostitute in the trunk of a car. When the bus finally stopped, Dave took it out and played his trombone as if not a single thing was wrong.

TITLE: My thoughts on my own Christmas this year - am I doing the right thing?

POST: Firstly - sorry for the 'downer' on a day like today - just really on my mind.

Well Reddit, another year has come around and its Christmas - I work in retail so I'm surrounded by people that are talking about doing everything with the family and friends, buying presents for everyone, so on and so fourth.

With my career, and it being my own choice, I sometimes have to move to different places to manage stores, its still a yes/no choice but to move up its something that I have to do and shouldn't really say NO to, as its something that is somewhat required of you (see of it as, what are you willing to give up to get a chance of a life time) - although I'm starting to think just how much of my own life am I giving up to chase my dreams?

I don't live with my family anymore, and I'm roughly 1200km from them (not much, I know, but we are talking about $600 in flights, possibly more for return) - my girlfriend is now even further away, and shits getting pretty tough there too with the distance and not being able to be there for each other.

I left most of my friends, and rarely hear from them now (could be partly my fault not speaking to them either, but frankly I'm pretty busy most of the time and we just end up drifting apart).

So reddit, without giving you the entire life story, I ask for your guidance:

My job could potentially give me (X) amount of money to live comfortably for the rest of my life, filling a dream that I fill I would love to achieve - but in the process losing the closeness of friends, family and loved ones - but possibly getting them back in the end?

Or do I get out now, move back to family and loved ones (in an area possibly without as good job prospects and in some ways settle for 'second best' or have to work even harder to get where I want to be?

If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them - I mean, I don't have anything to do today on Christmas, right? I'm alone and self reflecting!

TL;DR:","  work in retail, distance from family and friends, think about giving up dreams to chase money and success - do I stay and work hard or leave now and move back to family and loved ones?","  I'm doubting my choices and its not even the new year - stay with my current job (possibly dreams/aspirations), potentially lose loved ones/family OR leave all that and go back to them"

TITLE: Me [30 M] with my wife [27 F] of several months, and a tax disagreement?

POST: I'll do my best to keep this concise.

My wife has a chronic illness. As a result she doesn't have a 9-5 job, doesn't earn much money, and really, really needs health insurance.

Our state didn't expand Medicaid, and my employer offers health insurance but it would cost an arm and a leg to cover her with it. She qualifies for subsidies on the market as long as we can bust our asses and keep her income high enough.

The trick is she would lose those subsidies if she has any other way to get coverage - i.e. my employer. Long story short, she's going to lie on her taxes and file as ""Single"" and obviously I have to as well. 

I am incredibly uncomfortable with lying on my taxes but both she and her mom (who was, to be fair, a tax attorney) think it should be okay for one year. I would imagine most people wouldn't lie to say they were *single* on their taxes, so I guess there's that.

I don't see a realistic way for us to afford coverage through my employer, unfortunately. I'd love for this to be a ""put my foot down"" moment but if that results in her losing coverage I don't think I can justify it.

We all have to make sacrifices in marriage ... is this a reasonable one for me to make? I guess worst-case scenario is we get caught and busted for a large fine. Which puts us back on square one (or square 0.5, due to the fines ...)

TL;DR:","  Wife has chronic illness, doesn't have employer coverage, would lose subsidies if she lied on taxes.

There aren't many young single women in my industry, so for the first few months I was swamped with suitors, but Mark (as is proper for a coworker) never showed any sign of interest.

About 6 months ago my team moved offices, and I had to start sharing an office with Mark. Naturally we started to casually chat more once we were crammed in the same 12 square yards for 9 hours a day, and I've slowly started to develop an irrational infatuation with him. I get unjustifiably upset if he calls in sick for the day, or even just shows up a little late in the mornings. He's perfectly friendly with me, but has never shown any sign of wanting to have any social interaction outside of a work context (I do meet with other coworkers outside of work sometimes). He's straight but been single the whole time I've been working here.

This infatuation is stupid, I'm not ready to start dating again, I know that coworkers are totally a no-go zone, he's shown no interest in me, and I don't actually think we'd even be particularly compatible. I haven't let my infatuation get in the way of my work, if anything I'm working longer hours because he tends to leave later than I would otherwise. I know I have to get over him, but I just don't know how to go about it since rationally I don't want to look for or get into any kind of non-platonic relationship with any guy right now. Advice, please!

TL;DR:","  I'm infatuated with my coworker, he's single and hasn't shown any sign of wanting anything beyond work-related social interaction. I'm not ready for anything serious right now.

POST: Reddit, I'm great on first and second dates when a lot of it is asking questions and getting to know about the other person. In fact, I love meeting new people because I'm pretty decent at small talk. After the first or second date though, I seem to run into a wall about what to talk about.

TITLE: Difficult situation. I (m29) am in love with one of my best friends (f28).

POST: Here's my situation:

I am in love with my good friend and coworker. We've both worked at the same ad agency in NYC for several years and over that time have developed a really solid friendship. We often talk, half-jokingly, about how we should travel together. Now there is a chance that our company might send us both abroad to work on a project together. I know she also really values our friendship, but I can't tell if her feelings go any deeper than that, like mine do.

Things are a little complicated by the fact that as long as I've known her she's had a long-term boyfriend, except for a short period last year when they took a ""break"".  It's also complicated because we're all part of the same friend group so I often have to see them together, which is usually torture for me. I'm not exactly buddies with her bf, but we have many friends in common. 

So, what do I do?  Do I just tell her how I feel and risk alienating myself from our group and possibly losing her as a friend (while still having to work with her)?  Do I wait and hope that things eventually fizzle out for good with her bf? Or do I just accept that I might never be with her and try to enjoy the strong friendship we have.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TITLE: How do you deal with people who are trying to have a life competition with you?

POST: I am in college, and am a photographer, I had this girl last year who I became friends with because we were both into photography, she asked me many questions, tips, advice all that stuff because I had been doing it longer and I was completely ready to share everything with her, while not really gaining anything in return accept a kind of satisfaction from someone wanting my help.  

She now constantly talks down to me, not just about photography but about everything, and literally just treats me like shit unless it suits her to do otherwise (basically never) I have a hard time being a bitch, and I always end up just being nice when I want to stand up for myself.  She has literally shoved everything about her life that I don't have in my face her family/friends/home/money/boyfriend (she has rich parents/family who have bought her every piece of equipment she has and paid her way through school, this only bothers me because I have worked very hard for what little I have, and she always whines about money, while I often am broke and rarely bring up financial problems)  

She is also (after having done photography for only 6 months) getting paid work, I have yet to have this, and it really is sheer luck but the very first ""collaboration"" we did together she had a model and invited me along (all fine) I said ""hey I know this awesome spot, and I have all this paint, and here is some awesome stuff we could do!"" then she posted all her photos before I did and didnt mention me so everyone thinks I copied her, and it has worked that way for many things to follow and I am just wondering how you people deal with being enraged at someone who you cannot avoid, also I think if I blatantly stop talking to her the rest of the people around us will think I am the one being a bitch, which also bothers me, what do I do?

POST: *Not sure if this belongs here, but /r/relationships does not allow general questions, so....help me out please!*

I've been dating my SO (34M) for about a month so I don't need to worry overly much about this right away, but I like to be prepared. I'm looking for the time frames that you experienced with landmarks in your relationships, to give me a ballpark. Examples include:

- When did you exchange keys?
- When did you first say ""I love you""?
- When did you start to feel like your respective homes were a place you could ""feel at home"", i.e. you would do dishes or help with chores even though the place wasn't your own?
- When did you start farting around each other?

Things like that. What do you consider landmarks? When did they happen?

We spend most of our time at my place for convenience and he seems to fit in to my home nicely. He is comfortable making breakfast or doing dishes and has offered to help with other chores if I happen to need to do them when he's over. So far I've turned down his offer to help with other chores, but I do appreciate the gesture.

I have a history of moving in too soon, so I know I need to wait QUITE a while before I ever even consider that move. Like, over a year. At least. I just don't know how the rest of it should/could play out. I do expect some widely varied answers, so any details as to why you think it was good timing/later than normal/sooner than normal would be much appreciated.

TITLE: I love my wife [29/f] but I feel like something is missing [28/m].

POST: I have been married for about 3 years now and I absolutely love my wife. She has been the best partner I have ever had. We have had ups and downs but we always seem to work things out and we have a healthy sex life. Things are going well but I just can not seem to shake the feeling that I want more. I have lived a prim and proper, mostly conservative lifestyle up until my later years in college. I got a taste of different types of lifestyles and I have always been amazed by them. My wife was the typical break away who decided to distance herself from her family and enjoy any experience she could. There have been tales of hitchhiking with hippys and free love and all that. She has a view of people that I never had (I have been fairly cynical) and it has enabled her to meet some very interesting people from all walks of life and allowed her to make very intimate connections with these people. Well she eventually met me and she changed my outlook on the world. 

We were married right after we both graduated from college and we have taken up a fairly traditional lifestyle. She has mostly transitioned away from the past. After I had a brief chance to experience what she had experienced and after all of her stories, I was a bit jealous. I feel like our marriage has cut me off from having those intimate experiences with anyone other than her. There is a sexual aspect to this but it is also about simple intimacy. Neither of us hinder each other in the formation of new friendships but sometimes I wish we could have more. We have briefly discussed additions in the bedroom but I have never been sure if she was actually interested or if it was just her indulging me. Plus, neither of us would know where to start. I have not really discussed this with her because I don't want to hurt her and she has a way of avoiding discussions like this. 

I have maintained the status quo and told myself that those times were over. I thought I would move on from it but even several years later I can not shake the feeling that I have repressed something within myself.

POST: I've been talking to someone for about two months now, maybe less. I'm not the best at dating and what not, such as knowing what happens. Especially online dating. We have met already and have hung out multiple times as well as gone on a date or two. Our hang outs have been dinner, movies, and other random stuff, but we've only really been on one or two dates. The other times were with other people, so it wasn't really one-on-one. I've slept over his place a couple times, but have only had sex once. We used to talk every day, but more recently it has been every other day or every couple days. Which is fine, we have busy lives. He especially has a very busy life. 

However, I'm not sure how dating really goes. I'm not really sure what he wants, nor am I sure how to bring it up in a conversation. I deactivated my dating profile a few weeks ago because I came back to over 100 messages one day and there was no one I was really into. Also, I was a bit hung up on this guy. I recently just reactivated it, due to boredom and unsure if this guy was into me, and I've noticed he's online almost every night. I'm very much into him, but not sure if he feels the same. I'm not sure when in the ""talking"" stage, I bring this up. It seems like he is into me and I sort of had a conversation with him the other night where he said he wasn't interested in a booty call. 

Am I overthinking it or should I just let it happen and see where it takes me? Do you think I should bring it up? Do you think it's too early to think about this stuff? Give me your advice.

About a month ago, I started hanging out with this guy who I've discovered to be the most caring, kind, and encouraging individual that's been in my life recently. Signs started to show early that there was some kind of attraction between us. Here are some things that have happened in the last month (some still happening):

-prolonged eye contact and lots of easy, fun conversation
-prolonged or tight hugging
-after saying goodbye, our eyes often meet once more before departure (with smiles)
-texting everyday starting in the morning and lasting into the evening
-he has said things like ""you are the nicest person I have ever met"", ""I see you as one of the people who will always be in my life""
-while on a weekend trip with friends, he threw his arm around me while sleeping (multiple friends sharing a bed)
-he said he would treat me to dinner (which he then turned into a group thing)

A couple days ago he told me he would be gone the next week because he was going to see his girlfriend (who lives six hours drive away) and expressed that they have been having difficulties for the past six months due to the long-distance. I learned that they have been together for 3+ years.

We'd been dating for about 2 years at this point and I still largely pay for all of our meals as well as our apartment + utilities. I have a nice luxury loft apartment and she keeps a very small--think glorified storage closet--apt in a bad neighborhood. She literally never goes there except to pick up and drop off clothing because I don't have enough closet space for two people. She doesn't pay a penny to live in my apartment or drive my car (we split the gas costs even though she drives it 80% of the time for her work and I walk to work.)

We both have good jobs. I make about twice what she does, but I have crushing student debt that I'm trying to pay off as fast as possible. I pay off about $3.5K of student debt a month, which really cuts into my cash flow, as you can imagine. She has about 1/10 the student debt I have.

I recently started suggesting that we split our food bills more evenly. I suggested that she could pay for her own meals and I'd pay for mine. Obviously we'd still go on dates and I'd pay for her meals, but on a day to day basis, I suggested that we split the food costs.

We ended up getting into a huge fight and then lots of old, old stuff came out and we ended up breaking up.

   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post.

TL;DR:","  Been working at a dead-end job for two years, would like to move across the country to a new place with new people and possibly make a fresh start. Should I stay put or explore?","  Should I stay at the same relatively dead-end job, or move across the country on a whim, to experience other things while i'm young?"

TITLE: Revenge on a New Roommate

POST: I share an apartment with my boyfriend. There are two spare bedrooms which are a constant rotation of friends-in-need. We recently invited a friend to stay with us while she figures out what her next step in life is. 

Now, I want people to feel at home in my apartment, but she keeps moving things around so we can't find them, using things that aren't hers, and ruining our possessions. Her version of an apology is an explanation of her actions followed by, ""So I'm sorry if I am guilty, but I don't think I am.""

Last Sunday I got around to sorting through laundry she took it upon herself to wash. She ruined an expensive pair of fingerless mittens knit with alpaca yarn and she lost a prized shawl, gifted to me for being the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding this past summer. When I explained as much, and how I knew she was the guilty party, she insisted it wasn't possible she was at fault, and if she was, I shouldn't be upset with her for things she did weeks ago. 

You can understand, I'm pretty annoyed and generally disinterested in her disrespect. 

So I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed. I won't even wear any of it, but if she feels no remorse losing my shawl, I don't feel too guilty either.

TL;DR:","  Roommate disrespects me by messing with my stuff, claims innocence when confronted, I'm keeping all of her clothes that were mixed in my laundry that she washed.","  New roommate washed my laundry without asking ""to help me out"" and is unapologetic when I point out that she ruined some irreplaceable items, so I'm keeping her clothes that got mixed into the load."

POST: This weekend my boyfriend confessed that the reason why we haven't had sex in a couple weeks is that 'when things start going well' he ruins it by getting the girl pregnant.

I am a very sexual person and if I had it my way, I'd have sex everyday, multiple times a day. So when he drops this bomb, I really don't know how to take it. I take the pill religiously, however we do not wear condoms. 

He has always been very upfront about his past --- including the abortions that he's had with multiple exes. However, when he told me that he doesn't want to have sex until we're married and ready to have kids, I was taken aback.

I want to be there for my BF and support him in anyway possible. Is there anything that can help him with the guilt and anxiety that he's feeling? Have you ever experienced this personally? Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you!

POST: I was in a relationship with the same guy for long time years. We were never suited. Made a massive mistake, we broke up. Lost all but two friends who are already in relationships and settled. That was three months ago.

I don't want to pick up guys in bars, I hate clubs. I work with older women that are settled with families, babies and belong to nappy clubs or whatever parents do.

Online dating seems good but also from old work friends experiences it can be tedious. I'm willing to give it a go despite this but have no idea what to look out for. I also don't know where to meet single people in real life.

Although both my exes have told me I'm pretty, I really don't think I am so there the whole self esteem thing. I'm friendly and flirty, but would wait for a sign someone liked me. So if I were sat in a bar I wouldn't just walk up to a strange guy and give him my number. Once I know someone I've got no problems with making moves. The thought of speed dating fills me with fear.

TITLE: Reddit, I've been friendzoned by the only girl I've ever considered to be marriage material. What do I do?

POST: So here's how it is: We met in high school. Became friends. Dated briefly in Year 12, but it didn't work out because we were young and I was kind of stupid. 

Since then we've always been close, despite living 3 hours away from each other. Over about 4 years, I have had spouts of falling in love with her again, only to give up after always being friendzoned.

Now I should be clear: in the past this girl has always been a bit insecure, and she dated plenty of boys to feel better about herself. After she woke up and realised how unhealthy that was, she made a decision to be single for at least a year. Now, she's happy with herself, because she took steps to change her life (yep. she's a keeper.)

So here's where I'm at now: we're both single, and we both enjoy that for now. But we're also really, REALLY close. I am crazy about her, but I have no idea whether I should give up and drift apart, or whether this could turn into a relationship in the future.

POST: So my SO and I have exchanged Christmas gifts quite early this year. I was pretty damn excited about him opening the gifts I got him -- all wrapped and tied with a bow and shit. 
Well, he pressured me to open mine. He told me to close my eyes. And at this moment, I'm all excited and shit. Then, he puts my hands around it. I open my eyes and its a little bottle of Honey Jack. Now, I love alcohol as much as the next person, but my heart just fell. I had gotten him something.. more sentimental. 
I got him this awesome Indiana Jonesy leather covered flask and a nice bottle of Abercromie & Fitch's Fierce cologne.
Well he opened his gift tonight,  and to see his face light up made me feel so happy. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed and not as appreciated. I'm really not a naggy, whiny SO. But this feeling leaves me a little sad and unimportant.  
Btw, we've been kinda together for a littler over a year.

TITLE: My wife of three months threatened to move out.

POST: Backstory: Been with her for about 4 years, things were great.  3 months ago we get married. We both work a lot, opposite schedules, and rarely see each other.  We bought a farm together, and have been settling in there too. Gradually she has withdrawn to the point of frigidity, and basic intimacy, holding hands, kissing, smiling. She comes home exhausted and sits there, at times I have to wrestle basic sentences out of her.  She says it's stress from work, and not to worry. I started picking up her end of basic work around the house and farm to help her out with stress. Still though whenever I try to do anything special, or social with her she always resists it, with rules, stipulations, or being negative, and an overall close-minded downer. Not her personality at all, but there it is time and time again. Conversely, she also will go and hang out with her friends over night regularly with carefree ease.  

Yesterday, as I serve her breakfast she says that, she doesn't take care of me.

Whenever we have time off she flees from my presence. Today, Thanksgiving was no different.  She talks about driving over an hour away to her friends McMansion for a Walmart thanksgiving. I reminded her of years past when we have done that and she ended up being exhausted at the end of the day, she just got off a 15 hour shift. She also never framed it within the context of me coming along, and left me saying she was only going to be there a few hours. 

Even though she works at a grocery store and finds it impossible to bring food home. I went and got ingredients for at least a home cooked meal tonight.  Well I fell asleep, waiting for her. Got a text at one in morning saying that she was going midnight shopping.  So I finally called her out for being inconsiderate, and wish her a happy thanksgiving. 

She now wants to come get her dog and leave. Then goes on (via text) about how she constantly fails and pretends to be happy around me for months, and she should just grab her dog, who is attached at the hip to my dog, and leave.  

WTF?

TL;DR:","  Wife of 3 months has been acting distant, and cold, and has threatened to leave me.  She also spends excessive time with her friends and doesn't take care of me.

TITLE: I [17M] was with my new girlfriend [17F] and I couldn't perform when it counted.

POST: So I haven't had the best luck with the ladies in my life, but I finally got a girlfriend and I'm crazy about her already. She's hot, smart, funny, everything I wanted in a girl. 

So we're at my place and things get hot and heavy and we begin kissing and taking off clothes. First off, the furthest I've gotten with a girl before this was a blowjob when I was drunk at a party. Anyway, clothes are off and I'm hard as a rock waiting to go.

I go down on her and I'm still rock hard and she climaxes and she's ready to return the favor to me. When she goes to blow me I start to go soft for some reason. I;m trying to concentrate on her and the generous, hot action she's doing but I just can't focus. I'm so confused and to compensate for that I go down on her again and the erection returns.

She says she wants me to fuck when I'm done going down on her and I get up to fuck her and I lose the hard on again. After that she was accepting and said we could wait (I'm still a virgin) for the next time we get together. I'm not sure why I kept losing the hard on when it mattered. If it changes anything I always over think things and I'm in my own head a lot. 

I talked to my best friend about and he said that I was probably nervous, but I'm completely ready to lose my virginity.

TITLE: Thoughts on a prenup

POST: I proposed last weekend. We've talked about it for a long time, I just finally got around to doing it. 

Now to the important stuff. We've been together for over 5 years, lived together for four. She's extremely responsible with her money, which is one of the reasons I haven't really thought I needed one. She pays me a set amount a month for rent, we just kind of split other things like groceries and such. I'd say I generally pay for going out to eat, vacations, etc. But I make a lot more than she does, so I don't have a problem with that. Even though we have separate accounts, I'd say we both consider things ours. I do own a house, but like I said, she's paying a little over a 3rd of that payment a month.

I don't want to sound like I have love blinders on, I'm a pessimist generally, but I can't really see the need for one. If something ever did happen where we got divorced, which I really can't see but I know people change, should I still get one? Honestly if that happened, I know myself, and I'd be civil and fair about who get's what, I could guarantee that. I really couldn't see her being any other way either, we're a lot a like that way.

We're not going to have kids, and if we did split, I'd feel she was owed at minimum, all of the money she paid towards the house, if not half of the house itself. 

So, should I still look into getting one? Feel free to be as critical as possible about my views on things. She already asked me if I wanted one, as I technically have more assets than her (even though I consider them ours), so getting one wouldn't be an issue. I feel the fact that she asked that speaks to her financial responsibility.

TL;DR:","  Been with GF for 5 years, split household responsibilities fairly, she's extremely responsible with her money, should I still look into getting a prenup?","  have a financially responsible fiance. Can get a prenup if I want, but don't feel like I should. Should I?"

She once put her phone on my cellphone without me asking for it.

She would also sit beside me in all classes.

TITLE: Foot swollen after Salicylic acid wart treatment

POST: Hi there,

Basically, I have had a plantars wart on my right big toe for almost two years and the past couple weeks I have been fighting it pretty relentlessly. I have been doing freeze treatments, applying salicylic acid, and removing layers of dead skin.

The last time I removed skin was on Monday night. I got deep enough that I felt I was almost at the base of the wart. In an attempt to get closer to the bottom, I picked at the wart with my pocket knife (consistently disinfected the knife and my foot with lots of rubbing alcohol and wore gloves). I got deep but only deep enough to draw a tiny amount of blood. I then started reapplying my Salicylic acid treatment to the area from that night until this (Wednesday) morning.

Today, my toe was very sore all day at work, and stung fairly sharply on the spot of my wart. I figured it might be from the salicylic acid, so when I got home from work, I soaked my toe in apple cider vinegar in an attempt to remove the dried acid. However, this didn't get rid of all of it. Also, at this point, I realized my toe and was getting fairly warm and swollen, and that the rest of my foot was getting a bit warm as well. After this, I took some isopropyl alcohol and a knife, and gently rubbed/peeled away all the visible dried acid left on my toe. However, my toe doesn't feel any better. I am currently laying with it raised and covered in neosporin.

Long story short, should I be concerned about some sort of infection or anything? Or could this just be a normal response to my treatment? I have no known allergies, other serious medical conditions, or anything like that. I am a 20 year old white male and am (hopefully) healthy.

Thank you!

TL;DR:",  Had a plantar wart on my big toe for 2 years. Recently started salicylic acid treatment and the wart is now swollen and painful. Is there a chance of infection or anything else?,  Did a bit of self surgery/salicylic acid treatment on my plantars wart. Now my toe is red and swollen. Should I be worried?

She said 3 days earlier that she would breakup with me if I didn't find a job in 2 weeks, she broke her word. She said that I wasn't mature enough for a relationship. She told me not to get stuck on her and that I would find another girl. 

Then as of recently we stopped being friends with benefits because she has a new squeeze: my friend who I introduced her to. He told her to ignore me and she complied and now I am being treated like the bubonic plague. She threatened to throw out some of my clothes if I didn't give her marijuana and ever since(a full month later) she is still ignoring me.

I would really like to get her back, but I understand that might not be an option. I am struggling for the first time in my life to be independent and will soon move to a state where I can start the business I want to but it will take some time before I am successful enough to support her and give her what she gave to me. 

Personally it hurts but it seems like the best option is to move on, still I am having a hard time getting over her and I feel like she is telling me to fuck off. I think we both made mistakes but I think that her actions are unacceptable.

I hate my job, and I'm finally finishing up my degree so that I can move into something else. Unfortunately, I've heard too many horror stories about recent grads being offered $13-15/hour and taking it because it's actually pretty good, relative to other offers or opportunities.

I'm terrified that despite my education, I won't be able to move into anything that pays more than I'm currently making ""right out of the gate"", so to speak.

I'm not afraid to move if I have to, and I can learn pretty much anything I need to. My BA will be in ""Integrative Leadership Studies"", which is just a generic Adult Degree program at my college.

TITLE: Me [38 M] with my Fiancee [27 F] of one and a half years, I found out she cannot leave me because of financial reasons

POST: About 8 months ago we had a very bad fight. She had caught me in a lie (nothing about cheating, but it was something I lied about my past that was important to her). She was on the verge of breaking up with me. All of a sudden, we were fine about a few weeks later, and we rarely fought about that reason. 

Now, I just came to realize after a breakdown she had, that she may actually want to break up with me but she can't because she relies upon me greatly (much greater than I thought) for financial reasons. Basically she'd be out on the street and so would her mom (she sends her money from her part time job). If it were only her she said she could be ""free"" in her own words (but I think she might have been implying that she *would* be free if she had the chance.

I'm not 100% sure what she was saying, that she *would* definitely not be with me now if it weren't for financial support, or that she is just upset because she doesn't at least have that choice. 

I can't figure it out, and I am devistated obviously! She just went to sleep and I don't even know what to do. 

I don't want to force someone to be with me while they don't want this, love isn't a one way street. Even if she tries to ""make the best of it"" to be with me, I only want someone with me who's in it 100%, especially since we plan on getting married.

TITLE: How can my [25/m] boyfriend and I[23/f] split the holidays?

POST: I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 3 years now. For the last 2 years, when Thanksgiving and Christmas came along, we spent it with our own families. His family lives 5 hours away from my family, so it's not very realistic to spend one day with one family, and then go to the other one's the next day. I would really love to spend a holiday with my boyfriend, but I feel bad for my parents. His family makes a much bigger deal out of holidays than mine, and he likes his family a lot more than I like my family so I can't convince him to come spend the holiday with my family. Thanksgiving is tomorrow and I could still go with him to his parent's house over mine, but I hardly ever see my parents. My parents are currently spending a lot of money on me to put me through school, so I feel like it's really selfish of me to ditch my parents to spend Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family.

So I guess the main question is: Should I go ahead and finally spend a holiday with my boyfriend of 3 years, or should I spend it with my parents since they've been such good parents and I feel bad?

And for another question... How can my boyfriend and I split holidays in the future so that everyone is happy?

TITLE: I hate a majority of the females in my age group.

POST: 23 year old male here. I don't know what else to say about this other than I hate the personalities of the 21 to 28 year old female population. A majority of them are completely superficial and have no drive beyond being the pretty girl or the object of physical desire. Having a conversation with them is like pulling teeth and hardly consists of any real or meaningful topics. Drinking, social media, and 'pretty' things. Basically the only three things that matter to women in this age bracket.

I know I know... This is not true for everyone/fuck stereotyping/everyone is an individual bullshit. But seriously, take a look at your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account. You'll find a majority of this to be true. And of course you'll find the great ones who are just awesome people, but I feel like they are rare and very much exceptions to the rule. 

I compare them to the women I work with, who are around 30+ years of age, and the personal experiences I have had with them. A higher percentage of these women are incredibly funny with a deeper sense of humor, enjoy a broad range of topics in conversation, and treat people with much more respect. 

I guess the

TL;DR:","  I hate the majority of the females in my age group. They are shallow, superficial, and have no drive beyond being pretty or objects of desire.

TITLE: Filming inside an airport, is it illegal?

POST: Ok, heres the story:

I was flying from Fortaleza (Brazil) to Stockholm (Sweden) with a connection in Lisbon on Monday evening. Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us ""We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there."" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer ""You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!"" (in portuguese). 

Thats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: ""You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away."" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. 

So reddit? Is it wrong to film inside an airport? Was she right and I wrong?

TL;DR:","  filming inside an airport, lady tells me to put my phone down and if I continue she is allowed to throw it away. Is it wrong to film inside an airport?

TITLE: My girlfriend [24/F] wanted to break up with me [23/F] - did I wrong her?

POST: We've dated for about a month and a half. She wanted a serious relationship. To preface the situation - she told me about a time when she was having exams, and she vomited. Her parents or boyfriend at the time would take care of her.

I came down with a bad fever and was coughing blood. I took a week off school and work. She took time off studying to spend half a day taking care of me. Two days later, she has her final exam. While I'm at home recovering, she calls me to let me know that she feels extremely ill and threw up in the middle of her exam. I tell her that she should call 911 immediately as I won't be able to come to her and she does that, and is hospitalized for the day. I do not visit her, as I feel quite sick and fear that I may have passed something to her.

The next day, she goes home to recover, but is still feeling quite down. I go to visit my parents to pick up some mail. I ask if she needs anything at this time, and she declines, telling me that she doesn't need me to help her now.

A week later, she tells me that she wants to break up over the situation. Her friend had to take care of her in the hospital, and he asked where her boyfriend (me) was. She also pointed out that I was feeling good enough to visit my parents. I was still coughing blood and had a fever at that point, and wasn't thinking very clearly. I had feared that I may have passed something to my girlfriend and that visiting her in the hospital could be bad for both of us.

TL;DR:","  Girlfriend vomited during an exam, and told me that she wants to break up with me over it. I was sick and possibly passed something to her. Did I do something wrong?","  Girlfriend takes care of me while I'm very sick, then vomits during final exam 2 days later. I didn't visit her in the hospital, and she wanted a breakup after that.

perhaps not directly, but her life is such a mess and he is the only one that can give her stability because he does everything she asks him to. always awaiting a command always willing to let her if need be even cheat on him so long as it suits her needs.

I didn't let that happen. and its caused such a rift between us that its now over. and here i sit. day 5 into no contact. not because i want to get her back but just because i can't deal with the pain knowing her ex is always around or some other guy is always around. the questions the insecurity the sleepless nights wondering if she's snuggling up to another man that's not me. 

She contact me on the second day of no contact sending me a video of her doing cute things basically a movie version of a selfie and how she couldn't stop thinking about me. I ignored it answered the next day saying ""loved the video"" and that was it. She keeps liking my pics on instagram its like she's still with me but not. its just silence.

TITLE: My [18M] Girlfriend [17F] lives in an abusive household

POST: Hello, Reddit.  I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.

First off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.

My girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  

Even when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.

My mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.  I would love to hear reddit's opinion and if you guys think there's anything we can do to help her.  We are all here to support and and do whatever we can.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend lives in an abusive household where her mother physically and mentally abuses her.  She is trying to do everything she can to protect her younger siblings but her mother is very manipulative and controlling.  What can we do?,  GF's mom is abusive and controls every aspect of her life that she possibly can.  Would like to know how I can support her/possible courses of actions I could take to do anything about the situation.

TITLE: I'm [M20] worried about emotional manipulation from girlfriend [F20].

POST: I've found recently that my girlfriend has been saying things which make me feel uncomfortable dye to the way they're said. We're not doing great at the minute so I'm concerned this is changing my thinking. 

Essentially, we had an argument recently and now talking between us is more stilted (we're in different countries right now, by the way). The things that have me worried are when she says things like she needs to talk to me to distract her from thinking about hurting herself and that she ""hopes I know"" she's depending on me to make her happy. 

I don't want to seem overly selfish, I'm concerned about that. Of course I want to help and I have for as long as we have been dating (around a year and a half now). It just feels like some of these things are more of a threat than asking for help. This is partially caused by the fact that when I try to offer suggestions they're met with rejection as being too hard, not what she wants as the solution or simply as not going to work. 

I feel guilty writing this and I feel guiltier that I've been considering the future of our relationship recently. It feels like she's making sure I know just how guilty I should feel if I left. This is made worse by her recently accusing me of fostering her dependency on me while I'm not dependant on her (I'm not sure how I did this and when I tried to offer her ways of becoming more independent they were shot down). 

Am I being selfish here and thinking too much about my self, not enough about her? I do want to help and I don't want to make it all about me but these thoughts keep coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do so any advice is appreciated. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before?
Am I wrong here and being overly defensive or is this manipulative?
Most importantly, where do I go from here?

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend is being manipulative by saying things which make me feel uncomfortable. I'm worried this is changing my thinking and affecting our relationship. Has anyone experienced something like this before? What can I do to fix it?,  It feels like my girlfriend is threatening me to ensure I stay with her. I don't feel like this is right but I'm not sure if I'm being overly selfish.

TITLE: I think my beagle is sick. Can anyone offer any insight/share any similar experiences? (x-post /r/beagle)

POST: So last Friday (March 29th) my 5 and a half year old beagle, Miles, started acting weirdly. He would start shaking and quietly whining. My family and I chalked it up to being in a new environment since we brought him to stay with us overnight at my grandparents' new home. This wasn't too worrying to us, since Miles is epileptic (relatively common among beagles) and we assumed he was having a mild seizure. But the problem persisted through the night and every couple hours he would start shaking again on every inhale. Also, he refuses to jump onto the furniture he knows he's allowed on; he chooses to stay on the floor and whine or I have to pick him up to be on the furniture with me. What I noticed starting yesterday is that he seems to be in pain around his bottom ribs and haunches. I tried lightly poking him in those areas every couple of hours and every time I do, he yelps. 

Throughout all of this I noticed what worries me the most. As any beagle owner would know, beagles can't shut up around food. Never before has Miles acted calm around food, let alone slept in his kennel during Easter lunch in a strange environment. He won't run up to snatch a treat out of my hand, either. I have to offer it to him a few inches from his nose, or, if I throw it on the floor he might be bothered to mosey on over and chomp it up very slowly. 

Does anyone know what may be wrong with him?

TITLE: [insurance] I can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family

POST: Okay... Long story short.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. 

We went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)

I would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.

Sorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.

TL;DR:",  can no longer afford insurance for myself and my family. Wondering if there is a way to navigate the insurance system so that we can get our family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual income,  My wife and I decided to get degrees and have a kid. We apparently made bad choices because now we owe 12k per year in childcare costs and our insurance went from $90 per month to over $500.

TITLE: Me [26F] with my boyfriend [37M] of 11 months, long distance relationship says I'm being to needy.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months, the first few months of which we lived in the same city. He recently moved away for work and we are now living in different countries.

  If I had my way we would be texting trough out the day because that's just the way I operate and when something noteworthy happens, he is the first I want to tell. That doesn't go over well with him because he feels like I am bombarding him and he can't get other things done, which I'm fine with. I've been trying to keep my texting to minimum. 

 We've also had other issues where he was feeling suffocated when I wanted to spend the night with him most nights, but we worked through it.

 So right now we are trying to make this long distance thing work and I know he doesn't like to text or be texted a lot so I suggested (after reading a whole bunch of long distance relationship tips online) that the first person to wake up or go to bed would text the other goodnight or good morning. That way we know we are thinking about each other and it's a way to keep our everyday contact alive even if we are thousands of miles away.

 While he initially liked the idea and texted goodnight and good morning he has not done so these past couple days. I brought it up to him and he got very defensive and said that I was being needy and that he doesn't want to text me because he HAS to be because he WANTS to, which I totally understand. Except when I've tried to just let things flow I'll get one text every two days and that's just not enough I feel to keep a long distance relationship alive. So I would like an outside opinion on this; Am I being to needy? Should I just be grateful for the attention he gives me and leave it at that?

Thinks we should just let things happen naturally but then never texts if we do.

TITLE: How shitty of a person am I?

POST: This is a throw-away, and as kind and respectful as you are Reddit, I want your honest opinions.

Over the weekend, I ended up sleeping with two different girls within about a 14 hour period.

The first girl was early in the day, maybe 1-2pm.  I was talking to her and asked her to come over and get lunch and make out.  Her and I have sort of dating the last year.  I say sort of because it has never been official, we've discussed it numerous times and never decided to make it exclusive.  We have sort of a cutesy relationship in terms of how we act around each other, so it's not a clean pump and dump.  She lives about an hour and a half away, and I see her maybe once a month if that.  We're kind of on the tail-end of whatever it was we've been doing for the last year or so.

Then later that night another girl called and asked to hang out.  She has a thing for me, and I'm conflicted.  She's cool, and a solid friend, but sometimes attractive to me, sometimes not.  Everything was normal, and we watched a couple episodes of LOST, and then I told her I wanted to go to sleep (asleep sleep).  Then jokingly asked her if she wanted to start drinking, somehow we ended up drinking, and 2 hours or so later, she told me she was tired and we needed to go lay-down.  We have a slight history of hooking up.  Like twice in a couple of months.  Anyway, she obviously stayed the night, and we ended up sleeping together.  How should I feel about myself for doing this?

TITLE: I [17M] am confused as to what I want with my gf [18F] of a little over a year

POST: We started dating my junior, her senior year and have been ever since. Now I am a senior and she is away at a college within reasonable driving distance. I love her and she loves me. While we are content with each other (we like to see each other, like some of the same things) I do have a few concerns about us. 

1) I have never had another serious relationship with anyone else. I feel like I cant make an informed decision of weather I an truly happy here unless I take some time to sort me out and try dating some other people to see what its like.

2) While some of our interests overlap, other things don't mix, our love languages are different (I'm big on touch, her not so much, but she puts up with it to an extent), we like different kinds of movies and stuff etc

3) Our families are from different socioeconomic classes, mine higher than hers. This isin't a big deal to me, but it adds stress to when I think about a possible future for us (how we would deal with bills/stuff, her family (and extended family) structure is different, much larger than mine and just a completely different dynamic).

4) While every time I have told her I love her, I have 100% meant it, I think I'm too young to choose a forever partner. I think I need to build my own life and see what else is out there.

I have been discussing this with her and we considered an open relationship so I can see what else is out there, and while she agreed at the time, I don't think she is ok with me being with anyone else while we are ""together"", which I completely understand, but in that case I don't want to string her along if the end goal is to just be ""ok"" this year and break it off when I go to college net year. 

She says I'm selfish, and I agree, but I'm having to weigh my love for her vs. doing what is best for me.

TITLE: How do I [22M] confront my friend (and ex girlfriend) [21F] about my remaining feelings for her

POST: Recently myself [22M] and a friend of three years [21F] (not close, on and off) hooked up and from there began a relationship. We dated for four months before she called time on it in January because she ""wanted to be alone"" and by herself for the last few months of our last year of University (although she followed this up by saying she would probably ""regret"" her decision in a few weeks and that I was ""the best"" boyfriend she'd ever had, great closure, huh?).

I understand all her reasoning behind it, the last year being stressful and to add a relationship onto that would be extra tough. However, although I agreed to still be friends with her, I still have strong latent feelings for her. I have attempted ""No Contact"" a few times but keep getting drawn back into texting/messaging her. Every now and again I will feel like I'm over it only to see her around, get a text or be at a party/gathering with her and have everything rush back.

I'm sick of this, and so have resolved to bite the bullet and confess that I am still attracted to her, and, though I'm aware that at the moment she just wants to be alone and be friends, its not something I can change for now.

I don't, however, know how to approach this. I obviously shouldn't (and don't plan to) do this over text or messaging. However I also feel a phonecall would be too impersonal and wouldn't get my point across properly. I was thinking of inviting her to have lunch at a neutral location (a cafe on campus or similar) and talking to her there.

So, the crux of the matter is what do I say and how do I go about it? I don't want her to feel like its her fault or that I'm going to ignore her / be a dick about it. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion it would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR:",  Still have lingering feelings for ex girlfriend after our relationship ended. How do I confront her about my feelings and how do I go about making a proper and appropriate approach to the situation?,  Still have feelings for a friend and ex girlfriend and want to know how I can tell her this without alienating her completely or coming off as a dick.

TITLE: Me [23 M/F] with my two best friends who date each other [22 M and F] of 4 years, found out one cheated and need advice

POST: Hey reddit, obvious throwaway just to be safe. This is an odd situation with me.

Earlier today I was at work having lunch, when Kate decides to tell me and another co-worker a secret of hers. It went something like ""2 years ago, Adam that used to work here engaged in sexual activies"" - she knew I was friends with Adam, she did not know that he lives with me however. 

Now, normally I would confront him about it, ask him wtf he is doing, he's my best mate - but he tends to not always think with his head. The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. 

I know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.

So reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

I was indecisive and so I told the waiter ""1 of every slider!"". He put down his pad and said ""Really, dude?"". I don't tolerate this kind of disrespect and saw it as a challenge. ""Yes,"" I said, ""All six, with cheese!"" About 35 minutes pass and I've drank all my water. No refill would be given to me. The boys finished their meals and we're ready to leave.

TITLE: I want to understand his point of view on this monogamy issue...

POST: ok.  We have been together 5 years, me and his both 24.  I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner

Quick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  

Similar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.

POST: throwaway for obvious reasons. THIS HAPPENED TODAY.

She posted a pic of herself celebrating something and decided to share on the website, and got alot of points for it. Thus, being seen by alot of people. I.E ME. My first reaction was ""oh good for this person, that's amazing"". My second reaction was something like...""wait I know those eyes"". This was around 2 AM. So the genius that I am decides to message her pretty much stating (insert name here)? I thought to myself, that's not creepy right? It probably is, but she'll understand. if anything she'll ask who this is. NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO WRONG IN MY LIFE. Since i'm still up I decided to log back in and see if I had gotten a reply. she NOPE'D outta there and deleted her account. So I probably made her **SUUUPER** uncomfortable, and people really don't need that. if you happen to read this know that I'm incredibly sorry and I will never do that again. uhh. congrats. ... :(

TITLE: Laid off after two days on the job, what's a entry level person to do?

POST: Fresh out of college, trying to get a job as a server though I have little to no experience with it. I really wanted the job because serving is a skill I want to have experience with. This local business hired me, I told them upfront I had no experience but was a quick learner. They started me off first day as a dishwasher, and I handled it fine. The second day they wanted to start training me as a busboy and ease my way into a serving position. I was so excited for this opportunity to move up that quickly. I paid close attention, asked a question for clarity when I didn't understand something, and made sure that the guests were well attended to. At the end of the night they told me good job and though there were a few things I needed to work on they didn't expect much for my first try at it. 
I go into work today and the manager (who wasn't there the night before) sat me down and told me that they were letting me go because they didn't feel I wasn't good enough and that they needed someone with more restaurant experience. Though I only worked there for a few days I was devastated. It's a shitty shitty feeling when someone tells you you're not good enough. I mean, I'm smart I'm competent I feel like I'll pick things up once I get a hang of things. 

I've been scrolling through Craigslist the past few hours looking at more restaurant positions and all of them say the same thing ""2+ years experience required."" Even a dish washing position is required to have multiple years of experience. I feel like the problem out there isn't that there aren't any jobs, there's tons of them I just looked at. It's just the pool of unemployed is so large that businesses are demanding the highest of qualifications for some of the most entry leveled jobs. So my question is how is someone who isn't as qualified compete in our world today?

TL;DR:","  Laid off after two days on the job, business told me I wasn't good enough for the position and needed someone with more restaurant experience. How does someone who isn't as qualified compete in our current job market?","  Got laid off for not having enough experience, how can someone who is ""inexperienced"" compete in today's job market?"

TITLE: I am [19F], and my mother wouldn't approve of me 'online dating'.

POST: I'm so sorry this is all so muddled, I just don't know how to explain it properly. Also wasn't sure what to flair this as, so I just put it as 'dating'.

I am a 19 year old female, never had a boyfriend and only had my first kiss a few months ago, so I'm relatively 'innocent'. I know Tinder isn't really a ""dating app"" but I installed it a few months ago just for fun, until it turned into me actually agreeing to meet up with guys who I hit it off with. But I'm facing the problem of my mother, who I haven't told that I'm meeting people online, because I know she would get angry or not allow me to meet people.

I've only met one guy from Tinder in real life, and the only reason I did was because I lied to my mum about where I was. Today I was supposed to meet up and have lunch with another guy I met on Tinder, so I told my mum I was having lunch with a boy in the city. I was contemplating just saying I was having lunch with friends, but decided to tell her i was going with a boy, but not that I met him online. Then I realised that i made a massive mistake, as now I have practically dug a grave for myself, when i told her I met him locally when he actually lives nearly and hour and a half away, and became really evasive about other details. So I ended up cancelling the date, and I'm going to be questioned SO much by my mum that i'm going to have to confess that I lied and that I met him online, and that's going to cause a bit of strife.

I feel so pathetic about virtually needing my mother's consent to go and meet people! I know about 'stranger danger' and am safe when it comes to this, so how do I go about meeting people from online with my mother being so over-protective? I honestly don't know how anyone my age does it.

TL;DR:","  19 year old female, never had a boyfriend, installed Tinder app to meet guys I hit it off with, mother would probably disapprove of me meeting people online, how do I go about meeting people with her being so strict?",  Mother isn't approving of me meeting people online and I ended up digging myself a hole by lying. Should I tell her I met the guy online? How should I tell her? And should I stop 'online dating'?

Well the moment i entered the party she made it pretty clear where we both stand. 

She was already drunk and was quite touchy. When we were alone i went for the kiss and we made out a couple of minutes until she had to go back to the party. 

Well over the time of the party we made out on and off when we had time and space. 

We both were now pretty clear that we wanted more. 

The problem was that we had to wait for the party to end. Wellll that didnt happen. I eventually left at 5 in the morning tired we agreed that i d call her the next day. 

Me leaving her alone wasnt the best feeling but staying was a torture i couldnt have made it without falling asleep.

I called her today. We will meet this week.

I think we know each other quite good but i believe she doesnt know me aswell as she may think and that freaks me out.

TITLE: TIFU by throwing my shitty slipper at an old lady.

POST: This happened 10 minutes ago. I was walking home from the grocery store— a full bag of stuff ranging from milk to toothpaste, in either hand. This stuff was really heavy, so I wasn't really looking down, scanning the road for potential shit for my feet to squish; I just wanted to get home quickly before my arms separated from my body. You can probably guess what happened next, I stamped on a surprisingly large piece of dog shit. Or maybe it could be human shit, who knows. I don't know my shit. I didn't know what to do. My house was just two blocks away, but I didn't want to keep walking in my shitty slippers. So I decided I'd try to shake most of the shit off of it. I shook. Nothing happened. I shook harder. Nothing happened. This shit was made of super glue. I see the old lady who always wants to start a conversation with me for some reason; she's approaching me. I freak out. My arms pain really bad. So I shake my slipper really violently, and it comes off and flies right at the old. It hit her left boob, shit side up. I didn't know what to do, again. I was freaking out even more now. I had two options— wait, apologise, take my shitty slipper home and have a fucking long conversation with the annoying lady; or run home one slipper less. I really didn't want to talk to the lady, and eh, I could buy new slippers. I had just a few seconds before she approached; the shock of the flying shitty slipper was still with her. I committed, and ran— nay, wobbled like a penguin wearing one slipper. This still isn't over. The handles of one of the bags tore. It fell off. I lost my wobble-rhythm and the other one fell too. I lost my balance and fell with it. I just left all the stuff there and sprinted home.
I don't know what I'm going to tell my mom.

POST: Male 16. So I've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now, and we really seemed to click. A few weeks ago she was being really flirty, and seemed like she wanted me to ask her out. I was waiting for the right time to ask her out, but she was never just by herself with me to ask. 

   A week went by and I tried talk to her and she just seemed really distant, like she almost wanted nothing to do with me. We had this off and on relationship of her being really flirty and then really distant. This has lasted 5 weeks. This [thread] I posted in r/teenrelationships sums it up pretty well. 

   Anyways, I'm ready to make one last ditch effort/try to move on. What I'm asking for is advice on this one matter: Should I tell her how I feel? I think it could help me get my feelings for her off of my chest and make it easier to move on. On the other hand, if she gets all touched and stuff and wants to go out with me after that, then hey, that's great.

   I do realize that telling girls how you feel isn't really fair to them by overloading them with all of that baggage. I do realize that I could create a completely irreparable relationship with this girl. I'm just ready to make one last ditch effort, or make an effort to move on.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my married online friend [30 F] 3 months, strained emotional relationship

POST: I posted a few weeks back but deleted the post. The summary of the situation is this: I met a female gamer playing an mmo who is currently married with two kids  and is in an emotionally abusive marriage. She has been in this marriage for 10 years. My insecurities caused a rift and our contact has become strained. 

We became close, feelings were very strong and we professed our mutual love for each other. We chatted and Skyped often. 

In time, though, my insecurities and unease with the situation placed stress upon us both which has brought me to where we are. I tried to break off contact two weeks ago and stated as such. She was devastated and I ended up being unable to follow through. We decided our best bet was to try and remove the emotional side from it and I have been unable to do so.

I've really struggled with everything. I feel like I love this woman and I know that my constant worries and questions caused the rift. It became very hard to not feel sad when her husband would call and interrupt our Skype sessions. Or when she suddenly changed factions in the game we played and seemed no longer wanting to play with me. I would make my feelings known and she tried to reassure me. It all became too much, as she felt as if it wasn't enough and she couldn't be enough. 

This past week, I told her that I couldn't handle just being friends right now and I should try to take some space. She explained that she doesn't feel the same as she once did and she doesn't know what the future holds. She said she isn't able to write things off for good yet but space and time are important. 

My questions are this:

Is there hope or is it worth holding out hope for a future? 
Am I wrong to feel so bad about how I handled the situation?
How can I overcome my insecurities relative to this situation?

TL;DR:",  Met a married gamer online. Relationship became strained as my insecurities and worries about her marriage caused strain. Tried to end contact but she doesn't feel the same. Is there hope for a future?,  I've struck up an emotional relationship with a married woman and couldn't handle the situation. Looking for advice on how to preserve our relationship or move forward.

TITLE: I sent my estranged friend an anonymous letter and I don't know how to process the response. Advice would be appreciated.

POST: She and I met in freshman year (I was 18, she 17) as neighbors in our dorm. We lived together for several years (about 3) but at some point started to have our insecurities interfere with our relationship. Our friendship faced several set backs and pretty much fizzled out in a rather dramatic fashion. At first this was okay. I was angry and couldn't communicate or forgive. At the time I didn't want to acknowledge that I had made mistakes too. 

A long while had gone by since I'd thought about her. I've been dealing with a lot and have kind of gone down this hermit path, I honestly have no friends in the city I live in. In my loneliness, the thoughts of our good times came to mind and I just started missing her so much. Now go to several days ago - I sent my friend an anonymous message on tumblr basically saying I loved them and always will. Of course this could be interpreted both as friendship-love or romantic, so this could have been unclear. A few messages later (still anonymous) it was basically said that she had realized who it was and that they had let it go (meaning our past problems). 

QUESTION: Now in my note I had hinted I wanted to rekindle our friendship so, should I take this 'all is forgiven' attitude as she is over the past and that's it- no chance; or, is the person over the past and open to something? Sorry that was pretty drawn out or if this all seems petty. It's just this person meant so much to me at one point. My feelings got hurt and I hurt their feelings, and then it was just done. Time has passed, making reconciliation that much more unlikely.

Am I being delusional or weird for holding on to some memory of a person?

**Here's what I love about my relationship with him:**  

* I love the guy and he loves me

* We agree on all fundamental values & beliefs
* We talk about getting married in general
* He makes me laugh
* He is so smart and caring
* I trust him with absolutely no reservations 
* He is the kindest, most wonderful person in the world and I've never met anyone who didn't like him  

**But**  

* Though we've talked about marriage, there's no proposal/engagement/plan with real goals
* We've been together for so long that I don't remember what it's like to be myself
* I'm attracted to more than one person outside of the relationship, and that terrifies me
* I hate it when I feel like I have to drag him to go out and have fun/justify wanting to go out and have fun (like at bars, dancing, etc)
* He still has 3 more years of school left and that seems like such a long time to wait to settle down
* I feel like I'm trying to justify being unhappy because our relationship is wonderful on paper and I feel like I'm just a shitty whiner/guilty about wanting something different

TITLE: I [F, 24] had a falling out with friend [F, 23], have anxiety when I need to see her in group situations. Help!

POST: I'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.
A few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.

However, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.

Normally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.

Has anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. 

Do you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now? I didn't want to stir drama but was thinking that maybe at least some of my close friends

We've seen each other a couple of times since our mutual breakup and he has helped me through some tough personal times since then, but things got really hard for me after I slept with him over a weekend trip away with some mutual friends. I just miss him and regret ever agreeing to our mutual breakup without ever really voicing what I wanted. 

I'd like to think that we will still remain close and supportive friends, and I hope we do, but being able to see his Facebook and follow his every move was just destroying me and making my depression all the more difficult to deal with. Which is why I've (finally) decided to start NC and just get on with myself. I've unfriended him and it was hard but very liberating. I know I'll certainly see him in person in the near future again due to our mutual friends and common interests, but knowing that I don't have to speak to him again unless it's on my terms is both painful and good.

TITLE: [NSFW] BF [22 m] and I [23 f] can't agree on this boundary

POST: Together 2 years.  I'm using a throw away because this is a bit of an awkward problem I don't want associated with my main.

My boyfriend and I are pretty good at compromising, and have always been good about approaching the problem as a team. However, the current discussion we're having is something we've been unable to compromise on.

My boundaries are pretty strongly associated with interaction. So while I have no problem with my bf looking at porn or gonewild or whatever, commenting or messaging someone on those or other mediums is not okay. 

I found out fairly recently that my bf downloaded mods for a popular game that allow you to ""have sex"" with other characters, and that he had specifically downloaded characters, characters with certain appearances, and some characters resembling celebrities. 

When I found this out I was very upset. Maybe a bit of an overreaction, but I think that's because I saw his comments on subreddits talking about these mods and characters, and a comment that basically crossed the line for me because it was on a nsfw photo album. 

We discussed it, we cried. I reiterated my strong feelings about interaction and commenting and he apologized and said he understood. He suggested he should uninstall the game and mods.

Now he wants to reinstall the game, and had been planning on re-installing the same mods. 

We can't come to a compromise. He feels that the modding is basically porn and is therefore fair game and none of my business. I feel that the modding (and involvement with selecting new mods, new characters and involvement with the modding community) is too interactive and is something I'm not comfortable with, as I feel it crosses the boundaries of our relationship.

TL;DR:","  BF downloaded mods for a game that allow you to have sex with other characters, and I feel that it crosses the boundaries of our relationship. We can't compromise on this issue.

TITLE: Help me save this situation!!!

POST: Hi guys,

So this guy [21M], say Chuck, and I [23M] know this girl [21M] Gloria, let's say. Chuck and I hang out at this regular spot and so have chit-chatted and learned that Gloria has flirted with us both on separate occasions and both of us agreed that she was a helluva catch -pretty, witty, musical, etc. The way that we talked about her was in a respectful ""man, I'd like to get to know her, she's really cool"".

Anyways, up until yesterday, we didn't know Gloria was available. So my buddy comes up to me a few days into it and says ""guess who swiped right?"" It was her! Now he's not very good at starting tinder conversations, so I just up and tell him to give her my number (as a joke, but play it off). I'm thinking to myself ""hell yeah I want her to have my number!"" 

Anyways, he texts ""Jimmy wants you to have his number 555-5555 and here's mine 555-5555"" and I feel like this is still in the realm of funny. But then he goes ahead and puts ""choose wisely"" which I'm worried might be too dead pan. I'm initially not too worried about it because when I last saw Gloria, we had the comfort level (with each other) of cracking sex and masturbating jokes. 

I can play this off in person, but text is pretty hard. And if we scare her from coming back it might come to this. So, over tinder, unless how can he do a follow-up to reconcile this situation and/or let her see the situation as the stupid fumbling of two young dudes that it is?

I asked him how I could do it to make him feel better and he suggested I tell my ex to pick up the stuff from my place. I agreed that I would try but while I think that making him feel is my first priority, I feel a little rude for asking my ex to make the trip. 

He promised he would work on these trust issues, but when I mentioned it to him, he kindly said that although he knew what kind of person I am, knew what to expect, but I had to ""build a rapport"" to maintain and prove that the trust was warranted. I was a little confused because I felt like I deserve to be trusted initially, as I trust him, but perhaps we have different viewpoints.

Are his views on trusting people warranted? Am I an idiot because I trust people too easily? What else can I do to build this trust?

TL;DR:",  Boyfriend is nervous about me returning ex's things. Says I have to build a rapport to prove that the trust is warranted. Am I an idiot for trusting people too easily? What else can I do to build trust?,  My boyfriend doesn't want me to go and drop off my ex's things because of trust issues and wants me to ask him to drive by and pick them up.

TITLE: I [27f] want to propose to my boyfriend [25m] on our 5 year anniversary.

POST: Boyfriend and I have been together for almost five years (August 30th!), in the most loving and amazing relationship I think anyone could ask for. We value the same things, make each other laugh until we cry (or fart), love each other's families, share interests, and respect one another's personal time and space. I can see myself with this man in 60 years, two old farts having a laugh at our grandchildren's expense. He is my guy, and I am his gal. That's really all there is to it. Also, the sex is AMAZEBALLS.

I know he wants to marry me, but I feel like he's waiting until the ""right time"". Waiting until we are a little more financially stable, until blah blah blah. I think within a year or two we will be financially ready to move into a larger place and get a dog and do all that ""pre-kids"" marriage stuff. A nice long engagement, and we're all set.

I want to propose. Personally, I think he'd get a kick out of it. He comes from a long line of feminists. I don't think he'd say ""no"", and really my biggest fear is that I'd steal his thunder. I have something truly spectacular in mind, but would like Reddit's take on it before I do something crazy.

What do you think, guys? Should I go for it, or wait to see if he possibly pops the question first?

POST: I had a bike accident and broke my wrist and separated my shoulder and some road rash. I went to the hospital where I waited 4 hours to get an x-ray. I was also given pain medication that was injected to me without telling me how much each shot would cost. They injected me about 4 times total.

POST: First, stomach cant burp almost. It wants to, but the mechanism to burp seemed fucked up. It cant burp, so I get sick, and it tries to eject everything instead. I hate eating now, since it hurts from the first few bites. And then after I eat a meal it hurts. Lots of discomfort. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. But, could that be due to saliva or something? I noticed when I throw up its...weird. Its like a blob of spit almost...could that be due to swollen tonsils? They stay big, but when I get sick, they get even bigger and hurt. I cant eat or drink for a few days. Also, my lymph nodes kinda get like a ball shape you can feel...

Anyway, that one is not so bad I guess. Ive been smoking MJ, and even with that I cant eat. But If I smoke a LOT, then I can at least eat a few bites. So, found a fix..

The sleep problem seems to be destroying me right now. I cant sleep from the time 11-2 is seems. For the last year at least. I have hypnagogia, so I play a ""movie"" or dream before I fall asleep fully. Ill be in the deepest thought you can ever have, and it will play automatically. Its sorta like inception. But after the movie, usually around 30 minutes, ill wake up. but lately ive been catching myself even before that. when it starts, ill think, wtf am i thinking about, and then be like, DAMN. When I finally fall asleep, i feel im not sleeping deep. Or if I do, no more than a hour. I wake up exhausted. I never get the tired feeling/sensation/chemical until the day. I take a nap, and I feel so much more rested after a few hours. But I cant take naps during the day everyday. Even if I dont nap, Ill be god damn tired all day. Then 11 comes and im fucking wide awake. Its hell. Weekend or weekday I cant sleep at night. Ive tried just about all the things they tell you to do. None work.

TITLE: Update Me [38 M] trying to figure out if my wife [34] of 2.5 years, cheated on me in the past

POST: [Original post](

Okay I finally talked to my wife. I was really nervous and tried to set up a good opportunity. When it got as good as I though it was going to get I just said ""So, did anything ever happen between you and dude?"" Not the smooth delivery I had hoped to make.

She said ""You mean like romantically? No, no never."" She seemed very sincere, and I believed her right away.

I went on to tell her all of the reasons I was worried, and she was very understanding. She was upset that I didn't trust her.  She did start crying when I told her about my fears that our daughter might not have been mine. She was upset that I would even think that, which is what I anticipated, and one of the main reasons I waited so long to tell her.

I put her in my shoes and asked how she would feel if a female coworker of mine acted in a similar way. It seemed like she hadn't considered that, and she admitted to being jealous and insecure in the past, which made me feel better.

She made lots of reassurances that if she was ever unhappy enough in our relationship that she would think about seeing someone else, that she would let me know things were bad way before it got to that point.

It's hard to describe how you can tell someone is telling the truth, but I could really tell. Unless she is some kind of amazing liar, which I think I would have known about after 16 years.

She did defend her douchey friend's actions a little, which I was bothered by. She said he always says things like that and doesn't really mean anything by it. I still think he's just a dipshit. I told her I didn't want to hang out with him and his wife anymore. We have moved 1200 miles away from where they are now, so it doesn't really matter.

So, yeah I am the paranoid insecure jackass that I was hoping I was.

Thank you all for your thoughts and advice.

TITLE: There's something to be said for some time off

POST: Last month (July 19th to be exact) I went for a 6 mile run and totally blew my knee. I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.

I got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training. I had been running about 25 miles per week, 5 days per week, and did two short (15 minute) basic calisthenics workouts on short run days.

When I had to stop running I started working out 4 days a week doing about 30-40 minutes on a hill climber set to maximum incline and resistance and was doing about 30-40 minutes of core and upper body strength training. Over the last 5 weeks, no running, I have unintentionally dropped about 3 pounds with no dietary change. I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.

But here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old ""normal"" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace! I only stopped because I didn't want to go from zero to 60 and risk reinjury. I feel like a million bucks!

TL;DR:",  After a serious knee injury I started strength training and have been running again and dropped 3 pounds with no diet change. Today I went out for my first run since July 19th and felt so strong and fast!,  Took 5 weeks off for an injury and concentrated on strength training and my first day back to running was fast and easier than ever before!

TITLE: Me [20F] with my boyfriend [27 M] of 1 year, on a break because of his lost desire for sex.

POST: We went a few days without talking at all so I finally ask him what's up. He keeps saying he can't explain it but he's sorry and that the fire is gone from the relationship. We meet up to talk about it in person and he says he lately has no sex drive, asks me why we need to have sex every time we hang out (2-3 times per week usually).

This made me feel really insecure and took my self-esteem down a notch but told him I wanted to fix it. His solution was to keep on doing everything else the same but just take a break from sex to see if that fixes things. I feel that there is an underlying issue with the relationship such as him just losing interest because we've been together for a while. So I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely and see how it feels.

On my end it feels like shit. I want to call him just to talk about our day or to say I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate to him. It gets a little easier each day so I'm wondering if I should break it off completely so there's no lingering hope of getting back together. That's the only way I see myself truly moving on.

Should I stay in a relationship where he is confused about his feelings and physically uninterested? Or should I break things off and try to move on?

It's been going well, met each other's friends etc except today she discloses that she slept with someone approximately 1 week ago. It's someone who she previously was interested in a romantic relationship but rejected her. She stated that she was enjoying what we had etc, and she feels this person would not have a relationship with her,

At the moment I have let her cool off (she's feeling a lot of guilt, confusion) and have told her to have a think. I think I'm happy to continue if she is able to prioritise and choose me, and really work on this. This might involve having to drop contact with the person she cheated with However it feels so early to be having to work on our relationship.

TITLE: Reddit, what kind of effect do you think that crime shows/movies might have in reducing the occurrence of thought-out, ""intelligent"" crime?

POST: I had this thought a few days ago when watching an episode of NCIS and they did the usual ""create a super high resolution image from a very low resolution image."" I got to wondering how much of it is real and how much of it is fake (or, conversely, how much might be under-exaggerated). Based on these types of shows/movies (bank robbery, conning, etc.) where the bad guy nearly 100% of the time gets caught, only an idiot would think it would be a good idea to do any of this stuff, and from my [limited] knowledge of the general criminal, I'm under the impression that they are mainly uneducated people in dire situations (or psychopaths/mentally unstable.. but I'm thinking mostly with regards the heist type of crime -- not assault or murder) that are driven to extreme lengths to make the ""easy""/""quick"" dollar. So I wondered, is it possible that these shows/movies that show the criminal, no matter how smart and creative, almost always getting caught could actually be (subconsciously or consciously) reducing the amount of more well thought through crime throughout the world?

TL;DR:","  Is it possible that crime shows/movies that show the criminal almost always getting caught may be subconsciously reducing the amount of well thought out, intelligent crime throughout the world?","  Could broadcasting hugely technologically advanced law enforcement always being able to catch the criminals be a way of making ""smarter"" people automatically not consider a life of crime?"

Now last november she came back, at that time I was at sea (working in the Navy). Since February we've been seeing each other again, been to the movies, restaurants, just hung out at each other's places etc, it's been fun. 

Couple days ago I asked her, what does she think about a relationship, to which she replied that she's not really looking for anything serious. I reluctantly agreed. Since we've known each other for some time now, I won't start ignoring her just for that, better to stay friends. 

2 days ago I had a party at my place, to which she came also. By time others fell asleep, we stayed up the whole night, drank and watched some stupid cartoons and spooned like there's no freakin tomorrow (got horrible blue balls from that). For a girl, who told she's not looking for a relationship, that was kind of odd thing to do, am I looking at ""friends with benefits"" kind of invitation or something? Confused af.

We are in the third week of her moving out. I am in our house that we bought 2 years ago and the daily reminders of her being gone are finally settling. I feel like I am the only one trying to make this relationship work right now.

She has been in therapy for 2 years and I just started 4 weeks ago. I am coming to many realizations and am confronting the issues that I made in our relationship. I know that now that I have seen that fear was controlling me I never want to go back to that dark place again. She tells me that she is afraid of feeling trapped in the relationship and not being able to keep her voice to ask for what she wants.

She isn't working on rebuilding the relationship, she is trying to figure out if she wants the relationship at all. 

She is the most important person in my life. I love her so much and it hurts an unthinkable amount that she doesn't want to try.

(Reason for my lack of experience is being extremely shy, low self esteem)  Reason I've started online dating is an attempt to salvage what's left of my life.. figured even though I wasted so much of my life at this point there's no reason I should just die as a lonely virgin, so i decided to at least TRY.

After about ~5 or so weeks I've met two girls so far, got at least one more to meet in the near future.  Problem is, I am a bit awkward (Ok, I am a lot awkward.)  I feel like I do not ""click"" with anyone, and would not really know how to flirt, etc.  Question is this: how important/real is this ""chemistry"" thing?  If I don't feel anything, is it possible to develop these feelings over time?

In other words, should I force the relationship forward just because I so desperately want one?  Or should I move on when I don't detect this ""chemistry"" thing, and have the gross audacity to actually *turn down* an attractive female when I'm a 30 year old desperate virgin?

TITLE: TIFU By trying to have two females hook up in my backyard.

POST: So this happened about 20 minutes ago.

I was in the back yard, replacing a damaged sprinkler head. I dug up the old one, and removed it when I noticed that the hole was slowly filling with muddy water. It was so murky, I could not see the bottom of this 5 inch deep hole. So, I get the new sprinkler, attach a 1 inch male coupling to the bottom, and then attach another 1 inch female coupling to that, so that the new sprinkler would sit a little higher, therefore be more visible while mowing. I lower this into hole, and start twisting, hoping that it will snag onto what I had assumed was another male end at the bottom.

After doing this for about 2 or 3 minutes, I am starting to get frustrated. I reach in there to feel around, but the hole is too narrow for my grizzly-like hands. I try using towels to get the water out, to no avail. I try to widen the hole by using said water to turn dirt walls into mud, so that my hand might fit better. At this point, I am ten seconds away from making the hole larger using a shovel, and possibly having more dirt and debris fall in, when I look up at the old sprinkler head. I realize my foolishness. Attached to the bottom of it is the male coupling that I had been attempting to attach my female coupling to.

I pop off the new female coupling, sink that sprinkler in, give it a good twist, and vam, bam, boosh. Filled up the hole, and am now sitting here, glad none of my friends were around. After realizing my mistake, I had it done and said with, within 1 minute.

POST: Hello /r/relationships. I've been dating this girl for 2 weeks (only had one date, we're both in the army so it's kinda complicated), but we've known each other for two years, and been great friends for over a year. We've had a hiatus after some ugly things surfaced, but lately we got in touch, and I decided to ask her out, because I'm 18 and never actually had a girlfriend or even a date before.

So we went out and whatnot, but no touching or whatever occurred. While I'd usually be concerned she's not interested in me, knowing her personality, she's quite shy and somewhat fears touching and whatnot, so it's understandable. 

Tomorrow we're going on another date, and I was wondering if to just flow with the situation, or somewhat push forwards and ask her if she wants a more serious relationship, i.e. actually be a couple. While she shies away from contact, when you approach her with these things, she's honest and says whatever's on her mind. So I was wondering if I should or shouldn't do so - because we've been good friends for over a year, we know each other well, so is it worth bothering going on regular dates or should I just try and ""force"" the issue on her?

I was living close to his house and he asked if I wanted to hang out sometime.  I didn't think anything of it.  I knew he and his wife had divorced and figured he wanted to have an excuse to go to the bar.  

We had a few drinks and went back to his place for a couple more drinks as the bar closed.  He switched from beer to some heavily poured mixed drinks at a fast pace.  He began to talk about his life and got into some DEEP shit, and got emotional.  I just kept listening trying not to be a douche, thinking maybe I am helping.  Then he started saying ""I haven't felt so close to anyone like this before"".  I said ""that's understandable, you are talking about some heavy stuff"". He kept going saying "" I feel like I want to hug you.  Maybe hold you if you want to sit over here"".  I told him I was comfortable where I was.  He kept going and I politely got up to leave and he changed his tune quickly.  He tried to give me a hug at the door but I switch it to a handshake.  I felt bad but not much I could do.  He was ten years older, two levels higher than my boss, and most importantly I am straight.

A couple of weeks later I did something at work that would have been cause for immediate termination (one of those bureaucratic safety things where no one could have been hurt but it's just a rule).  He was in charge that day and he changed the violation to a lesser offense that allowed me to keep my job.

To start off, a little back story; my girlfriend is of Christian background and I'm not, and she did tell me she didn't want sex before marriage about 4 months into the relationship. A but late, but I respect people's decisions and don't want to push them into these things. She's a Virgin, I'm not, but I thought this girl was awesome and though ""fuck it, not worth breaking up just because she doesn't want sex"". 

So recently, Valentine's day, I (stupidly) brought up the situation of living together and sex before marriage, I always saw sex as an important part of a relationship and a way to intimately connect with your S/O and express your love. I also feel that living together before marriage is a great test, because some people cannot stand living together even when in a relationship. My girlfriend believes all this should happen after marriage. 

A part of me feels like it's her parents who are also heavily influencing her decisions, she always brings it back to disappointing her parents with her decisions. Whilst I respect that, some times I feel her parents are controlling her indirectly. Am I wrong to think this?

So after an argument last night, my girlfriend and I came to the point of ""do we break up, or wait till marriage"". And I'm left here really confused and stuck. I don't want to break up but at the same time I'm so worried,confused and I feel like I'm missing something now. Have you been in this situation? Do you have any advice that can help me?

POST: I love my husband sometimes, but I don't love him all of the time. I may feel bad for him sometimes, and try to love him out of pity, but I know that isn't love. I just had to get that off of my chest. 

My husband knows that I loved him enough to have given my virginity to him. 

I don't like it when he guilt trips me to try to get into my pants faster when I don't feel like having sex.

Sometimes I'm not sure why I married my husband. I hope that it's not out of pity. I'm scared that if he ever finds out that I get guilt tripped easily into ""love"", he'll get angry that I may not love him as much as he loves me.

What should I do? I'm scared that he has already figured it out that I may never love him as much as he loves me.

POST: So I've known him for a few years now, but only recently have we started dating. He's definitely someone that I care about and he hasn't given me any reason to doubt his sincerity.(so far)

BUT, the hardest thing is that he goes out dancing a lot (that's where I met him and we do that regularly) and has SO many friends that are girls. They are beautiful, smart, fun, creatures and sometimes it's just really hard to trust that he's really just interested in me only.

POST: I had given him the passcode the day before while I was driving so he could change the music.

Prior to this I had been very clear about having trust issues and really enjoying my privacy. He claims that if the tables had been turned and I looked through his photos he wouldn't have cared in the slightest. 

In his defense he was slightly sleep deprived...and although he apologized he thought most people he knew wouldn't react the way i was and thought I was being overly sensitive. 

For the record, there were no inappropriate pics but there were some embarrassing selfies i had taken while drunk, lol. So I'm pretty mortified and honestly that's contributing to my anger. The bottom line is that I feel it was an invasion of privacy and it says a lot about him, what do you guys think?

TITLE: Don't know if (or how) I [22F] should tell my boyfriend [25M] I really don't like what he got me for Christmas.

POST: Yeah I realize it is now a long time since Christmas and this part of my dilemma, which I guess is my own fault. So for Christmas my boyfriend (of ~10 months) got me a gift certificate for a ""makeover and photoshoot"".  I can't really imagine doing anything much worse than spending my day having my hair and make-up done than having my photo taken for two hours. Okay, maybe a bit dramatic but I'm really not that kind of girl and my boyfriend does know that. I guess he could be hinting that he wants me to dress up a bit more but I didn't really think he cares – I think it is more likely that someone told him it was a good gift idea or something he got for an ex that they really liked.

Anyway, I pretended I liked it and hoped he would maybe forget about it and I wouldn't have to use it. But, more recently he keeps asking me when I'm going to go and if I've booked it yet. I'm all ""oh yeah I'll do it soon I'm so busy at the moment"", which is obviously not an excuse I can carry on forever. So my question is should tell him I don't want to go? I would feel bad because it has been a long time now that I've pretended and he probably did put quite a bit of thought in what to get me. Also what if I do tell him, what would be the best way to bring it up without sounding like an ungrateful bitch? Or should just suck it up and go? Obviously I could make it through, especially if I had a drink or something before to help me enjoy it a bit more but I really don't want to. Any advice is appreciated.

POST: My story is, (24m)i have been out of relationships and even have had literally no sex life for a while.  I met a girl(22f), who i think is awesome, and she has a boyfriend.  That isnt the problem.  I respectfully act as a platonic friend to the girl i originally had feelings for, and to a lesser degree her boyfriend.  Now, somehow or another while i was drunk and we were all hanging out at a bar one of her friends(19f) came up to me and started giving me compliments and all that, she posts on a sexual comment i made on fb later on that night, i get her number not very long after (next day, first time we talk on fb).  We have been meeting up to see eachother with other people around and she always kisses me, which i am loving.  I even got her to go see a big concert with me in a city thats 30 minutes away (she brought her friend tho, and we didnt do anything but kissing/a little dancing)  Yesterday i txted her early in the day and she said ""Im in a terrible fucking mood"".  I ask why, she sais its personal, so i say ok, you dont have to tell me if u dont want, as long as you still talk to me.  she sais ""okies""  and i guess i may have danced around it to see if she would let anything else out.  ""so what are you pregnant?"" lol gawd no etc etc.   well, i finally send her a last one saying to hmu if she wants to hang/talk/wtfever.  she didnt, and instead made open facebook posts about how happy she was and shit.  

heres where i fucking blew it reddit:  seeing the fb posts i txted her ""hey u up? i wanna talk to u im gettin this wierd feeling that i missed my chance or somethin...""

its 730 am.  should i just go get drunk or something and try not to think about it? cuz im kinda stewing in what closely resembles highschool style rejection.

TITLE: How can I convert a print book to an ebook?

POST: There's a book I'd like to read that isn't available as an ebook.  I'm perfectly willing to buy a DRM-laden ebook version of this book, but it's simply not available.  I bought hard copy of this book (actually 3 books, but that's splitting hairs) but, being a techie, I'd really much rather have an ebook.  Preferably in .pdf, .doc, .rtf, or some other flexible, easy-to-use format.

There has to be some way of turning a physical book into an ebook other than individually scanning each and every page by hand.  I'm sure there's some kind of specialized machine that can do it, but I don't have one.  I'd be more than willing to pay for temporary access to such a device; maybe mail the book away, or bring it to a Kinkos-like place.  The thing is I can't manage to find any service that does this.  Maybe my google-fu is weak, but all I can find are websites and programs that convert one ebook format to another, and 1 or 2 services that are only intended for authors/copyright holders (and they make you sign a thing certifying that you are such).

TITLE: Dating a girl with a dog that hates men - How do I overcome this adversity and make this pooch at least tolerate me?

POST: Been seeing this girl and it's gotten the point where we're sleeping at each others places.  She has this dog, kind of a poodle or something (not exactly sure on the breed, small, white, kind of curly hair).  She (dog) is cool in the dog park, pretty decent on a leash, but in her own dwelling, does not like men.

Dog has no history of abuse by men, but the dog does not like men.  She is pretty territorial and barks when I even get close to her closet door (where she keeps the dog when I'm around, it's a huge closet, no sketchy neglect or anything).

Getting to the point where I have to meet this small beast and make nice-nice.  What is the best way to do so?  Apparently, she nips at hands/heels and will just stare me down and growl the entire time.  Should I arrive with treats?  I've raised pups on my own and never had a problem but mostly German shepherds and Dobermans.  Never thought I'd struggle with a poodle.

TITLE: Me [27 M] with my fiancée [27 F] 3 years, she proposed to me over a year ago and has been pressuring me to ""counter propose"" ever since.

POST: Our relationship has been great the past 3 years.  We rarely fight and we have a lot of fun together.

Backstory: over a year ago I ended up helping her with a medical issue and took her to the hospital to be treated for dehydration.  Carrying her in my arms, the whole nine yards.  She felt extreme gratitude afterwards and decided to throw tradition out the window by buying a pair of wedding rings and proposed to me, taping the whole thing using her laptop and recited a speech for me.  She liked it, so she put a ring on it.

We've been pumped about getting married ever since then, and have been waiting for her to be done with graduate school before we officially drop the money to tie the knot.

The problem is that in my mind, and from what we've been telling everyone, we are officially engaged and that she proposed to me.  She's been wanting me ever since to do a counter-proposal, where I basically propose back, and have a whole long written confession of my love for her.  Now, I obviously have no problem in doing so, but she said she feels like until I do so our engagement is ""fake"" (her words).

I feel like it's a bit messed up to have that sentiment.  Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I think that whatever proposal I come up with is just going to fall flat of her expectations, considering the magic of the surprise will not be there.  Not to mention, it kind of kills the mood if she is literally *asking* me to propose to her.

Am I being an asshole?

POST: I'll keep this brief. I always wanted to be married, want a family and kids, that hasn't changed. Dating has been crappy for me as I've been so focused on working since I come from a very poor family. I'm 27 now, doing well with my career (well enough for now anyways) so I have more ""time"" for dating.

Used Tinder for a while, had some fun flings, met a chick who was in an ""open marriage"" and just wanted to date. I thought it would be easy sex, went along with it. One thing led to another and now I love her, and she loves me. She admits this, but does not want to leave her husband (which was the first guy she ever dated, and according to her friends screams at her and manipulates her and is garbage, but it's her decision)

So, she doesn't want to leave him, loves me, I love her... I've been dating her for around four months now and I've been keeping it going hoping to build a bond with her and when I can have a 'very' serious talk with her about things I'll have more of a potential for her to consider my words about our future.

I need some advice. What should I do here? Should I stop seeing her?

TITLE: Me(22F) with my sister(18F) and her boyfriend(17M) Should I say something?

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for a little over a year now. They are each others first relationships. 

I recently got out of a 3 year abusive relationship. My anger toward my ex might be clouding my judgement but I'm not sure. 

For a while I've been noticing dysfunctional things in their relationship that remind me of my ex. Her boyfriend is acting like a typical 17 year old boy and is really into the physical aspect of their relationship. My sister is borderline verbally abusive to him. She says things like, ""I don't know why you love me, maybe you shouldn't."" I feel that she treats him poorly, is rude to him and expects way too much out of him. She tells him that we, her family hates him. I've heard them talk about getting married when he turns 18 so they can have sex without getting in trouble with my conservative Christian parents. 

My sister leaves for college in the fall and I think that's creating more strain. They fight a lot more often. 

So I'm wondering, do I say something to the boyfriend? I've talked to my sister but she doesn't listen, she just assumes all my words mean I hate her relationship and her. I think there's potential for mistakes, heartbreak and regrets on both their parts and I don't want that to happen. Should I talk to her boyfriend, tell him we don't hate him, we just have concerns?

TITLE: Reddit, I need your help with an over-protective mother.

POST: I'm 17, and recently started seeing a 20 year old. We've become extremely close, and since I met him I've been much happier and more motivated to do well in other areas of my life. I already get good grades at a difficult school, play sports, and have never had problems with drinking or drugs. Our relationship is what keeps me balanced.

My parents have been divorced for several years, and I live with my dad nearly full time. My mother is a bit over-protective, so I anticipated some difficulty, but not like this. She thinks that the age difference is too great for somebody my age, and doesn't want me to date him. This, I understand; it's her prerogative to be concerned. It can be worked around. The real problem is that she is now trying to attack my dad legally for being a bad parent, neglecting my safety, etc. On top of this, she refuses to talk to me about how we can compromise, just insists that this is in my best interest in the long run. 

I've been looking for articles about how being in a stable, loving relationship is healthy for young adults (articles seem to be the best way to get through to her), but I can't find many that address the pros of teenage relationships. What I really need is to convince her that this is a healthy thing, something that falls in line with her need to 'shape me into a good young lady'.

Any ideas?

Note: ""you're 17, you're too young to be dating, just enjoy life and don't feel like you need to be with somebody..."" Yes, yes I know.

TITLE: Roommate's boyfriend never leaves, but its more complex than it seems. Please help!

POST: I live with some college girlfriends in a small city in a very old home. I pay rent, utilities, (which include water, gas, heat, cable, internet, etc) and my own foodstuffs since I'm on a specific diet. I have known this girl for 5 years, and she has a boyfriend that NEVER leaves. It's not like he's a typical mid twenties burnout either - he's a teacher in a great school district, makes good money, and has his own place sans roommates less than two city blocks away. 

Basically, he is always here. Never leaves for more than his workdays and to pick up clean clothes from his place. He literally lives here, showering, cooking, doing laundry, and hanging out in the common areas even when his girlfriend isn't here. PLus, they have loud sex every night, which doesn't really bug me, but its getting a little annoying when you have early mornings and you are awoken to a slamming headboard at 2am every night...

Here is the real problem though. Many other sites that address this problem suggest that the boyfriend should chip in with rent and/or utilities. Here is the kicker - the roommate doesn't pay rent since its her fathers place. She has a joint bank account with her Dad (who is my landlord) to which she pays me the utilities that are in my name. She is a new grad and unemployed, so I know she isn't paying rent with her own money.

Myself and the third roommate are getting seriously frustrated. We both work hard at out entry level jobs to make ends meet, plus the work in maintaing the house. I basically feel like I am financing their love nest, and I'm sick of it. 

Sorry that was so long, I feel much better getting all that out.

POST: These past couple of years I had it very rough when it came to socializing and being happy. Well, friends kinda used some drugs and I was left alone for a while I later found out...but, before that....

I started to stay away from it as I lost confidence, had low self esteem,etc. I eventually and mutually met someone. I was shy but she was outgoing so I guess it evened out somehow.Asked me alot about myself and it felt good. We were going to be meeting more often so next time....when that came she randomly came over and hugged me and introduced me to some friends. We talked for a bit,said she was a bit concerned with her apperance and then she blurts out...let me give you my number, we will get lunch soon which we did. Went well. 

I bonded with her more and more as I saw her, got a random selfie with her which was odd, but also was called sweet for a thank you I gave her. 

Now there was times she was very rude or inconsiderate. She is known by others to be immature but I look past that most of the time as she did help me out. 

The weirdest event was her kinda following me. I was going to a game with friends and invited her and her friends like a week in advance. Gave her a heads up and she said she was busy, so I left it at that. I go to the game and was walking around and look down and saw her and all her friends. Okay someone else could have had an idea to go but come on that was a bit weird that she showed up then and there when she basically said no.

TITLE: Has screen-sharing been throttled on Skype and are there alternatives?

POST: Hello friends!

I am in a long distance relationship and as such Skype has been a major boon to the quality of our lives. This has been downgraded somewhat recently.

Me and my girlfriend would screen-share so we could enjoy movies and episodes together. It might not seem like much but we cherished the ability. I subscribed to the Skype service solely to keep that for us. 

Some time ago screen-sharing just stopped being able to cope with running video. I think this was around the time Microsoft acquired Skype although I'm not sure. This is confounding since both of us still enjoy good web connections and use high definition webcams that stream very well under normal conditions. 

Furthermore we have discovered that if we screen-share for any reason our call is seemingly throttled and we have to recall to regain quality.

I have googled this to no avail and I was wondering if anybody has any knowledge about this situation and/or knows a working alternative?

TL;DR:",  Skype screen-sharing has been severely downgraded recently and if we screen-share our calls seem to be severely slowed down. Has screen-sharing been throttled on Skype and are there alternatives?,  Is the Skype screen-sharing service throttled now and are there alternatives for watching video together over the internet?

POST: A few months ago, we had a pretty big argument. She was upset over it, and I asked her repeatedly if there was anything that I could do to help. She said that she was fine and during the week we had tons of fun so I genuinely believed she was fine. The next few days she messaged me telling me that she's horribly sad, and that she can't believe that I let her feel sad when we were together. 
(Oh! Quick note, she lives in a college a few hours away, and comes to visit every other weekend along with her best friend.) 
Now, this isn't the first time she gas done this, this happens weekly, where she does not communicate clearly how she's feeling and what she wants me to do, then she explodes on me. 
I was furious that she would have the nerve to tell me that I didn't try to make her feel better when I had at one point begged for her to tell me how she was really feeling, so I ended things with her compulsively (over text, so a total dick move on my part). She then called me a few seconds later telling me she was sorry and that she was wrong. I told her that I made a super compulsive decision when I ""ended things"" and that I was sorry and didn't mean it at all. That I just acted without thinking.
Everything was fine and dandy, until recently.
 This is the problem:
Now she's telling me that she is VERY sad because I broke up with her (even after I apologized to her for doing so, and practically begged her to believe that I didn't mean it) and she says that she is feeling insecure about the relationship because I had ""ended things."" She wants me to make it up to her by doing this grand gesture for her as a way of showing her that I really do love her (which I do) and to make her secure of this relationship. She wants me to make her feel better. And she's very upset that I have not done it yet.

I'm 27 and she is 28.  We've been together 2 1/2 yrs. and we live together.

Yesterday she got mad at me over the phone for not wanting to go to the beach the next day (she was on a lunch break). After we hung up she texted me and said I never try to spend time with her. I apologized and said let's go. She said she was over it and will go with friends. 

After that she texts me and says she is going out after work with friends and wont be home until late. She also said she can't go to my friends wedding next week. 

She doesn't come home  till midnight last night and when she walks in she doesn't speak to me and proceeds to watch tv in the living room and then she slept on the couch. 

In the morning I wake and she is in the bed. I try to hug her but she pushes me away and says  nothing. I fall back asleep. When I wake up again she is in the living watching tv. I say good morning and she doesn't reply back.

TITLE: TIFU by flooding my classroom and forcing my entire class outside for 2 weeks.

POST: Okay so to start things off this didn't happen today, more like 12 years ago. 

So I went to a small country primary school in Ireland. We had maybe 200 students total, if even that and my class (6th class, highest grade in the school, we were all roughly 12) shared a room with 5th class. The school is just outside of a small town and on rare occasions the water would turn off completely. This has only happened maybe twice while I was at the school.

One day the water went, towards the end of the school day. We had PE outside at the end of the day and afterwards some of us stayed playing until we were getting picked up. I went in to get my stuff before going home and went to wash my hands. Turned the tap on but nothing came out. At this stage the school was basically empty and the teachers were gone home. I didn't notice that the plug was in the sink and didnt think to turn the tap off again as there was no water coming out.

Shoot forward to the following morning and the room is completely flooded. The room is about 90% carpet so that is completely soaked and starting to stink. Its early june at this point and while I know Irish weather gets a bad rep it was a nice summer. We had to spend the last 2 weeks of school outside (literally no there room in the school for us) and while we did do some actual work we mostly got to play. We had taken our exams for secondary school already so there was nothing to study for. 

I never told anyone it was me but I knew immediately that I had done it. I spose it worked out for me but I know it probably cost the school a good bit of money seeing as it was a small school. Principal also took the blame for it cause she used to check to make sure the taps were off to avoid this. Felt bad for her but it was pretty good for me.

TL;DR:","  Went to school, didn't turn off tap properly, room flooded, class spent 2 weeks outside, Principal blamed me.","  Flooded my school when I was 12, had to spend 2 weeks outside, teacher/principal took the blame for it and cost the school some money but I was never found out."

TITLE: My [23M] sister [20F] got engaged 4 months after I did, am I wrong for being upset?

POST: My sister and her boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 years and lived together all through their 2 years of college (canada), and my fiancee and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. We got engaged 4 months ago after living together for 1 year. My sister brought it up to me that she wanted to know if I had any problems with her getting engaged since I just got engaged, at first I told her I was happy for her and then before it happened I told her I'm mad about it because I feel like they are going to take away our moment and showing off our engagement. When I told her I was mad she apologized and said there is nothing she can really do and that she doesn't want to or plan on taking away from their our engagement, but i'm still upset and feel like they only got engaged to one up us and because we got engaged.

Am I in the wrong for being upset about it or is she being a terrible sister?

TITLE: How do I tell my professors that I missed two weeks of class because I was going through opiate withdrawal?

POST: From sometime in October until just before school started up again two weeks ago I was hooked on pain killers. I started with morphine and eventually got to a point where I was doing almost any opiate I could get my hands on, with the notable exception of heroin. 

I made the decision to stop after the holiday break because I saw how my world was falling apart: my grades dropped, I became a farcical character in my social circles (became ""that guy who's always high""), and I had a couple close calls with the police.  These, among other reasons, prompted my family to tell me how worried they were about me, so I decided I could just go cold turkey and it would not affect my studies too much.

Wrong.  I have missed almost every class since two weeks ago, with little to no contact with any professors.  The few classes I did attend I went a sweaty, detached mess of a man.  My problem now is that I need to pass these classes, preferably with decent grades.  This is my last semester and I really want to be done.  

So, I come to you, Reddit, with the hope that some one out there can point me in the right direction, so I might get my shit together. I don't really know how to approach anyone about this in person, and I'm absolutely terrified of facing my peers and my instructors. Also, to the best of knowledge there is nobody, including parents, friends, etc., that knows the full extent of my problem.

Ideas?

TL;DR:","  Was addicted to opiates, decided to stop, missed almost every class since then, need to pass them with decent grades.  How do I tell my professors?","  I started started getting fucked up, I quit getting fucked up. Now I need advice on how to tell my professors so I can get my shit together.  Help?"

TITLE: 18f. Am I going insane? Are my relationship expectations too high?

POST: I hope I am posting in the right subreddit for this. Lately I have been feeling....anomalous(?) regarding what I want out of a relationship. Another fling of mine was recently ended because he 21M did not want to ""marginalize his friendships."" When I am in a relationship, I want a Tabula Rasa -- a complete clean slate. I don't want my significant other to be facebook friends or have any contact whatsoever with previous ex-girlfriends and/or people he has slept with. I provide the same respect. I am accepting of friends of the opposite sex as long as there is not a sexual or romantic past. It would make me uncomfortable if they were to hang out independently though, and I would prefer a group setting. 

It's as if my ideals are from another planet. All of the men I have met seem to think my relationship expectations are absolutely ludicrous. I, on the other hand, do not think it is expecting too much of a person. I am feeling lonely and as if there is something wrong with me. Am I being overbearing? I would really appreciate some objective opinions.

TL;DR:",  I am feeling weird about my relationship expectations. I want a clean slate and am not comfortable with my significant other having any contact with exes or people he has slept with. Am I being unreasonable?,  I don't want SO to have contact with ex's and all the men I have met find this to be controlling. Am I wrong for wanting what I want?

POST: -Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit but I figured it was a good place to start-

So I just started my college career (woo) and one thing I'm not sure about is female friends. I had friends who were girls in high school, but all of my REALLY close friends were guys. I'm on a co-ed floor, and I'm getting pretty close to a girl who lives near me. I have a girlfriend (goes to a different school) and she knows that, so she knows that I'm not interested in more than a friendship (I would hope), but I'm really interested in being close friends. However I'm not really sure what I can/can't do with a close friend who happens to be a girl... Like if I went to get food with a close guy friend or took a bus from campus to a store to get something with a guy friend it wouldn't be weird, but are there some things you don't do with a friend who's a girl that you'd do with a friend who's a guy?
Thanks for the help, I don't wanna like lead her on or something that would ruin a friendship because I really would like to be friends with her.

TITLE: So I have this friend...[M]

POST: One of my best friends, lets call him Greg, has a routine. Once he meets someone he wants to be friends with he ditches all his current friends and becomes best friends with the new guy. 

After about a month, Greg comes back to his old friends with the new friend and integrates him in to our little group. Everything is great; everybody is friends. 

But after a while, Greg stops being as close with new friend in order to make the new friend, say Allen, feel like he messed up and lost his chance to be friends with Greg. Allen is mad and acts like a dick to Greg and Greg does it back. After a while, Allen decides to stop being friends with Greg, but that would mean losing all his new friends who he met through Greg, who he likes better than Greg anyway.

Unfortunately, all of Greg's friends are on Greg's side because he put them though the ""best friend"" routine too and they have turned in to his brown-nosing army. 

Allen can either apologize and keep his friends, but be caught in Greg's manipulative trap again, leading to the same outcome or stop being friends with all of them.

What should Allen do?

TL;DR:","  Friend Greg puts new friend through best friend routine, stops being close with new friend to make new friend feel like he messed up and lost chance to be friends with Greg.

TITLE: My (27m) relationship questions!

POST: Hi reddit. I have been doing a lot of self reflection lately, having just come out of a 1.5yr relationship 2 months ago. 

There's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. 

I had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. 

It's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. 

Can anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships. Any more info needed or questions I'll be  sure to answer! Thanks

TL;DR:",  Was in a 1.5yr relationship. Was very attached to ex-gf. It negatively affected my self esteem. Don't want this to carry on into future relationships. What is going on?,  I would enter a state of anxiety when apart from my ex. Very unhealthy. What can I do to not carry this over into future relationships.

TITLE: Me [19M] and my ex gf [18F] have just broken up and I need some reassurance

POST: Will start with a little back story:

I had been with my gf for a little over a year, and it has honestly been one of the happiest years of my life. My gf adored me and made me so happy. I moved away to university in September whilst my gf stayed at home and we've seen each other semi-regularly since I've been away.

Since I moved away however it has felt different. Don't get me wrong, the amount I love and cared for her hasn't changed, but I have been beginning to feel that I am not ready for a serious relationship at my age. There are many things that I would like to do whilst I am still young that I couldn't do with a serious gf and I was beginning to not be able to be the bf I wanted to be for her because my heart wasn't 100% in it. It had gotten to the stage where I just knew I had to end it because I was, and have been for a while, staying with her to avoid upsetting her, as opposed to it being what I truly wanted which are not the right reasons to be in a relationship.

I know that my gf is completely crushed. She straight away blocked me on social networks and now I am scared she will never talk to me again. I know I have really hurt her, but I want nothing more than to remain friends with her eventually, but the hurt I know I have caused kills me inside, even though I feel I have made the right decision because I wanted it to end on good terms (well terms that weren't fighting terribly etc.), I still feel like shit because of what I know I have done to her.

I am just looking for some reassurance that my gf will be okay from people that have maybe been in similar situations themselves, because right now I feel like a terrible person and it's horrible.

Sorry if this message isn't the best written, but thank you for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR:","  Was with gf for a year, moved away, realised I wasn't ready for a serious relationship, broke up on good terms, still feel awful about it, looking for reassurance from people who have been in similar situations","  Broke up with gf, I have crushed her, need reassurance that she'll eventually be okay because I feel like an awful person."

POST: We've been dating for a little less than a year, on and off, and have been FWB for two.  Have broken up once before, got back together at Thanksgiving.  We don't have plans to see each other on V-day - he'll be working all day, and lives a 12 hour drive away, and I have to work this weekend.  I told him I would drive up next weekend, and he is planning our ""V-day"" already.  I am certain that I want to end the relationship; however, he does genuinely care about me/love me and I want to minimize the damage.  Would it be better to get it out of the way now, via Skype, or should I drive up next weekend and then tell him? I'm worried that it will be worse if I come up, he's planned a great V-day event, and I ruin his weekend.  Is it a dick move to end it via skype?  I know the timing is terrible, but I really don't want to hold out, miserably, for another month just because of a Hallmark holiday.

TITLE: So...the month of December was pretty much a giant middle finger to my progress so far. Time to pick up where I left off!

POST: This is my first post here so I'll fill you in on my story so far:

5'10"", male, 23 years old, currently 173 lbs (in the normal range, but I've still got more fat to lose to reach my goal).

At my heaviest I was 235 (in 2008) which I slowly brought down to 200 by July of 2011. From August to November I got more serious with my diet and exercise and got down to 165.

Then came December:

Final exam season hit, and along with it came copious amounts of coffee, energy drinks, and general bad eating habits as well as lack of exercise. However, I was alright with relaxing my diet as I was stressed about exams enough already.

Then exams finished and I went home for Christmas, where my mom had a fridge full of terribly delicious foods and snacks. Chocolates and candy were everywhere for guests (and me, apparently.) 

Combine that with seeing friends from home and drinking every other night, eating out most of those nights (and not making sensible choices, no less!), plus Christmas parties, Christmas dinner, New Years Eve party, etc. 

Long story short, 8 pounds gained. In one freakin month!

That's pretty much a whole month's progress. Gone. Not to mention the wasted month that I could have used to lose ANOTHER 8 pounds. I'm so frustrated with myself that I let it get that bad.

But I've now moved back to my place, where I have control over my grocery list, and I'm getting back on track. The chicken and vegetables are back on my list of staple foods, and its goodbye to all the sugary, processed, or deep-fried garbage that I inhaled last month. 

Thanks for being here loseit! You guys are what make it possible to say no to my previously unhealthy lifestyle and strive for a better life :) Wish me luck!

TL;DR:",  December sucked. 8 pounds gained in one month. Moving back to my place and getting back on track with healthier eating and exercise. Thanks for being here loseit!,  December was a perfect storm of events in my life that I used as excuses to eat/live like garbage. Now all temptations are gone and its time to lose it again!

TITLE: TIFU: By looking at my GPS.

POST: So I was driving to Upstate NY to help my SO move some of her deceased grandmother's possessions home. I had just driven from CA to VA without an incident. I was 13 minutes from my destination. A police officer was passing me as I looked at my GPS, which is on my phone, which was resting on my knee. He pulls me over. Mind you I was going the exact speed limit in the right most lane. 

Turns out that in the state of NY, I dont live there and I have obonly been there like 2 times prior, that driving while holding an electronic device of any type is illegal. So he takes my license and does a check in his car. It takes forever for him to do the lookup. While he was doing the lookup another officer pulls in behind him.

I have watched cops before. It is never a good sign when backup arrives. I am thinking that I have some hidden parking ticket or warrant. Great I think,  as I soil my pants just a little. The officer comes back up to my window. He hands me my license and apologizes that he is force to give me a ticket. He is nice enough to give me the DA's number and lets me use his pen, so long as I dont stab him in the neck with it. I asked if it would get me out of the ticket, had I stabbed him in the neck. He said no. 

I thanked the officer and asked if I were allowed to drive while holding printed instructions. He informed me thst in NY, at least, I could be drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette, eating breakfast, and read the Sunday paper. I just needed to keep one hand on the wheel. I thanked him and went on my way.

POST: The day before she said this, she was at my house and I was complaining about how she never does anything when we're alone together, she always waits for me to do something. She doesn't touch me ever and she doesn't ever make a move. I need my physical stimuli haha! 

Anyways, that day I just felt so alone. She would literally stare into blank space instead of looking at me. She wouldn't acknowledge me stroking her leg or anything. All she wanted to do was play mariokart it seemed like. When I started complaining, she said that sometimes she feels like she doesn't know me and that she feels like we have way different takes on how a relationship should be. 

She had to go home and we didn't finish the conversation, but I told her we need to talk about this face to face and not over messaging and she said okay. The problem with that is, she never has any time to talk face to face because she is in color guard at her school, but I was willing to wait until she did have time.

The next day, I tried talking to her over messaging, not about anything just a ""Hey, How was your day?"" and she blew me off. She said she had too much homework so she couldn't talk to me. I said, ""Okay, sorry, but real quick, can I pick you up from school tomorrow?"" and she said, ""I have things I need to do tomorrow, sorry"".

I said, ""What about our relationship though? We really need to talk."" and that's where she said, ""grades go out Friday, my education and eligibility for color guard are more of a priority right now"".

TITLE: Apparently I want to sleep with my two best girl friends who I can never touch.

POST: Sorry, title sounded a little awkward but I guess it makes sense. So basically the other night the girl I've been sleeping with (call her F) regularly comes over and stays over, we have sex and then pass out before we have class the next day.

I have a really hard time sleeping, especially staying asleep, and so a lot of times I'll wake up, but F is a really sound sleeper and it never really bothers her. I remember waking up at least twice, and both times F was snuggled next to me, her head on my chest, but when I looked at her, it wasn't her. 

I'm in a fraternity and so we have sweethearts who are some of our best friends, but one of the things is that we absolutely CANNOT sleep with them or have sexual or romantic intimacy, since that would put the relationship between the girl and the entire chapter at risk. BUT, both times I woke up, I saw a different girl. Two of our sweethearts (call them S and B) both have a lot of physical similarities to F, all short brunettes who are cute, and so somewhere along the line of waking up I saw first B, then S, instead of F when I woke up. 

I loved it. I like F a lot, but we're just keeping things casual so we're not in a serious relationship or anything, but I spend so much time around S and B as friends, with no romantic or sexual stuff between us (except one time with S before she was a sweetheart). But, I can't act on the feelings I have towards either one, which is that some days I feel as though I might be in love with one or two of my best friends, and that maybe the girl that would be perfect for me is standing right there, and I can't do anything about it.

I just wanted to tell someone this, because obviously if I tell any of my brothers/other sweethearts shit might hit the fan and people would look at me differently.

I have been seeing this girl for about 6 months now and it started out well. She was unemployed and actively seeking employment and living a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise. She is a nice girl and my freinds like her and get along with her well.

She had a previous relationship that ended badly and she got abused by her partner. She is on heavy medication to treat her depression and sometimes will cry for hours for absolutly no reason. I do my best to comfort her but it is hard for me to understand how it feels as i have never really felt bad depression.

I have been helping her look for work but now she doesn't even try. She has done self harm in the past and has bad scarring up her left arm. She has also stopped exercising and gained weight but she is still the kind person she was when i first met her.

I have talked to her about work and exersise and she gets upset when i mention her weight and just says she is still looking when i ask about work. She texts me at least 40 - 50 times everyday when im at work because she is bored. She says things like ""promise you wont leave me"" and ""i dont know what i would do without you"" things like that a lot.

I have tried talking to her parents aswell but they baby her too much and wont push her to do anything which i think may be the cause of the problem.

If she is away from me for more than 2 days she gets upset and depressed. It is starting to affect my personal and work life but i am honestly scared she will harm herself or go off her meds if i break up with her. To be honest i dont want to break up beacause i like her a lot. I only want to help her but how can i do this if she wont help herself?

TITLE: Me [22m] decided to break up with my girlfriend[22f] and I don't know if it's a good moment

POST: I wrote a post yesterday explaining that I want to break up my 4 years relationship.

I said that I don't feel the same, because she hates my friends and she is living miles away from me because she doesn't have money to stay in the city to continue her degree.

Today she has failed an exam and she is coming next monday to see it.

Is it a good moment to speak about my feelings?

I'm not sure if it's the right moment but I don't know when I'm going to be face to face with her again. It could be months.

I need advice.

POST: I'm 32/F he's 29/M, together 1 year friends for 2 before that off and on. My guy we'll call Luke and I went to our first pregnancy appointment today. I'm about 6 weeks. We've had a crazy day with his car not working right, supposed to be fixed but the hood flew up and crashed into the windshield while on the highway. Took it to his mechanic and we got another car to get home in. 

On our way to my place there's this stray cat in the road and it darts back across the street in front of the car. Luke doesn't even brake or swerve to miss it. We've talked about moving in together but he doesn't want my cats to come along. He's never had indoor pets or much of pets while growing up. Cats have been my companions all my life. My first pregnancy 9 years ago I went it alone and because of where I was living I had to give up my cats then to have the baby, alone. I gave them up. It wasn't feasible then. So here we go again. He wants me to give them up because he doesn't want inside pets. My Harley has food allergies and is racking up lots of debt for me with health problems and expensive cat foods. Mallory can be obnoxious sometimes. 

He lives with his parents has for 7 years now. I have my own apartment and bills and such. He's never had to be responsible or adult until now. He won't have a civilized conversation about keeping the baby or not. Is this really a good choice, what's the right answer? He says we can do it but the cats have to go. Even then he still wants to maintain two apartments. I get SSI Disability and am looking for work. He has a stable job. We need each other to do this right. But his lack of empathy tonight with the stray cat leaves me feeling scared of him. 

Any advice? This is my first time having a partner to have a baby with but I feel like I'm doing all the sacrificing.

TITLE: Me (21F) with my boyfriend (22M) of four years, in love but I have an intense fantasy of having sex with a woman.

POST: at the start of my four year relationship, I thought I was completely straight, realised I was also attracted to females, but never had any desire to experiment. as I became more sexually experienced I realised I wanted to have sex with a girl. it's something that has been on my mind for about 2 years and I can't seem to get over the fantasy. 

my boyfriend knows about this, though probably not aware of how strong my desire is. I don't think I could go my whole life without doing it, I mean i could, but I would definitely feel like I am missing out on something. it's started to affect how satisfied I am with my relationships sex life (we still have sex frequently, and I enjoy it, but I find my mind wandering to how it would feel if it were a girl). 

my boyfriend has actually said he would be okay with me doing it, and thinks it would be hot. he's even suggested a threesome (not sure I could do that) or him just watching me with another girl. I'm more inclined to the latter option, but if the girl was willing to include him in it as well, I might consider it, although the idea is a bit nerve wracking for me.

so my question is, is it possible to explore your sexuality outside the relationship without damaging it, and if so, how would I even go about finding someone that would agree to sleep with me (us), no strings attached, possibly have my boyfriend watch or join in?

TITLE: Do I [20 M] tell my SO [20 F] that she has gained weight?

POST: Let me preface this by stating that I have nothing at all against fat people. It's a body shape like any other and should be respected as such.

That being said, both my girlfriend and I would prefer to stay in shape. About a year ago we agreed that if one of us were to even start putting on weight, the other would let them know. Well, over the past few months she has been getting a little heavier. Nothing crazy or off-putting by any means (I'm attracted to her regardless) but I can't help but think about when we made that promise. 

We're very close and communicate well but she can get rather emotional sometimes so hurting her is the last thing I want to do. She mentioned to me that her mom had just recently commented on her weight and she (my SO) seemed pretty offended. 

For background and to preemptively answer some comments that may pop up: We don't live very close to each other and have relatively busy schedules so asking her to join me at the gym would be difficult. She's active through other activities but her diet isn't great.

Should I say something? If I did, how would I bring it up?

TITLE: I am just so confused

POST: So last month at a party for my grandma's birthday, my grandma says there is this girl that she wants me to meet.  I'm apprehensive because my grandma is famous for setting my brother up on a date with a one armed girl. No offense to the one armed ladies out there, it just took my brother by surprise.  I also haven't dated much (read: at all), but I finally got a handle on some major depression and anxiety that has ruined my life for the past 10 years, so I agree to meet her.

So we go on a few dates, and awesomely enough she is not only cute as hell but fun to talk to and hang out with.  I have an awesome time, and as far as I can tell she has a great time too.  Couple of days after we last get together she asks if we can put off getting together again while she hunts for a job.  I say of course, because that seems pretty understandable to me.  

I text her a few times, asking how the hunt was going, or seeing if she had time to get dinner blah blah.  Didn't ever hear anything back.  5 weeks go by, don't hear anything.  O well, she is either still on the job hunt, or just not interested I suppose.  Then this morning I get back from the gym to see she accepted a facebook friend request I sent her a long time ago.  According to my notifications, she accepted the request, liked some status I made yesterday, then unfriended me.

So I write this to repeat that cliché of I don't understand women.  Also, I'm letting facebook news bother me, so that's pretty cool too!

TITLE: Reddit, where the hell should I get married? Help!

POST: * My fiance and I live 300 miles apart; he lives in St. Louis, and I live in Alabama. 

* In seven months, I'll be moving to live with him permanently.

* Our tentative date for the wedding is May 2013. 

* We have no idea where to have the wedding. 

I'd been leaning towards having it in St. Louis, since by the time of the wedding, I'll have been living there for a year. Also, the city has more of a ""party"" atmosphere in general. Many people in the South (parts of my family included) can be a little uptight when it comes to alcohol. I want the wedding to be a drunken celebration, and I want to attract a fun crowd.

My mom really wants me to have it here in Alabama, because she thinks most of my family won't be able to afford to go if we have it in St. Louis. She says it's customary to have the wedding where the bride's family lives. 

Another argument she has is that my family is much larger than my fiance's, so I have more people to accommodate. She tells me to have the wedding where I want, but I know she'll guilt me forever if I don't have it here.

I wouldn't mind having it in Alabama, but I think it would make planning harder. I would love to have my family/friends to be able to come, but I also want *his* family/friends to come too.

My fiance is little help and doesn't have a strong opinion either way. His parents aren't picky where the wedding is either.

I've asked others for their opinions, but I was hoping that maybe Reddit can provide some magical answer that I haven't thought of yet. Or maybe some insight I haven't yet considered.

TITLE: Hey r/jobs, I need some advice on an upcoming promotion!

POST: First off let me say that I love my job.  I get to do what I love, in a killer place, but I don't really make a lot of money considering the field I'm in.  I work in a non-profit museum institution doing video production, and AV technical support as a secondary element to the job.  My salary is barely ok for an entry level position in my field (~30K), even though the work I've been doing up until this point is quite beyond entry level imo, but that's neither here nor there.  

My predicament is that my boss is taking a job elsewhere, his title is manager of AV, and they want me to take his job, but keep the creative responsibilities I have now.  While I agree I do want to keep making creative videos, I'm weary that they're going to try and dump his work load (relatively little in comparison) on top of mine with a minimal raise.  There is very much a rank non-profit culture here, very top heavy, and upward mobility is notoriously difficult (just as a caveat to anyone who might understand the particulars).  

And so my question is, how do I figure out in a cordial and non-confrontational way how much is fair for them to offer me for the promotion with additional responsibilities?  I realize I could just ask my current boss how much he's making but that doesn't seem proper or legit, plus he's been here for 20 years so they can always pull the seniority card.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!

TITLE: [16/m] I can't decide whether or not I should break up with my partner [16/f]

POST: I've been debating on the topic on if I should end my relationship. I'm not sure if what I feel for (let's call her Kelly) Kelly is genuine love, yet I have a strong feeling that it really is. Perhaps it's just because I'm going through high school and this is just the result of raging developing testosterone, but I digress. The kicker is that Kelly is near-depressed and mainly relies on me for emotional and moral support because of her abusive family and she can be self-abusive if she reaches a certain point of sadness (Note: when we broke up before it was because of her abusive father getting mad at her and out of emotion she broke up with me since I didn't come to offend her. In retrospect, she felt guilty about it and decided to re-start our relationship. She said she became a shut-in and didn't eat for two days, looking back that seemed somewhat ridiculous.) I feel like she also expects too much of a person like me with no type of job and her unneeded materialistic ideals are malicious to both my psyche and my bank account (I have no job). More and more, we are having arguments and fights starting for no apparent reason; just earlier today she got angry at me since I decided to hang out with my friends instead of her (but I was going to see her in a few days anyways). I also feel like that she'll become terminally depressed since she tends to be over-dramatic about things and do dangerous things to herself... I care for her, but her security, well-being, and health may be in danger if I end our relationship. Please respond, Reddit.

I'm finding it hard to understand something. My ex GF broke up with me 6 months ago, I tried winning her back for 6 months. We would see each other once every 2 weeks and we'd get on like 2 peas in a pod and she kept leading me on, however 2 days after seeing her she would tell me it was a mistake and that we can't speak anymore. This of course was really unfair and caused me great depression.

She doesn't want anything to do with me however she still messages me. Surely if someone wanted to cut someone out of their life they wouldn't go through all the trouble of constantly messaging someone?

I kindly let him know that I feel he isn't addressing me respectfully and he says nothing in response.

TITLE: Me (28f), my husband (29m) and his family Christmas Party.

POST: My husband and I have been married for three years.

We moved back to his home town shortly after getting married. One of the downsides to moving to his home town is that we are insanely far from my family, but our job prospects were better there, so we went. He has a very large family of Uncles, Aunts, and cousins galore. All very nice people, no real issues there.

The problem is that they have a yearly Christmas party and I have very bad anxiety issues. The past three years I've sucked it up and gone any ways, ending our visit with very bad panic attacks and my poor husband has had to cart me away back home (not that he complained).

We tried to compromise last year a little bit with going for two hours, but I really felt like I was ruining the party for my husband, who really only sees his family this one time a year, regardless of how close we are.

This year, I said that I'll just stay home and he can go as long as he wants. He's reluctantly agreed but is worried about what to say to his family about my absence. He doesn't like to lie, so he doesn't want to say that I'm home sick, but he also doesn't want to have to explain my anxiety, because thus far his family hasn't put that together yet and they would likely (this is just a guess) say that I should be going any ways to get over it. He doesn't want to argue with them the entire night about the benefits of treatments for anxiety disorders.

So my question is, what should my husband tell them when they ask where I am?

TL;DR:",  Husband has a large family of cousins and uncles who have a yearly Christmas party and I have bad anxiety issues. Husband doesn't want to argue about it. What should he say to his family when asked where I am?,"  Anxiety keeps me from the party. Husband doesn't want to lie, but feels the absolute truth would just cause a non-stop discussion about my anxiety (not fun!). What should he tell his family about me not being there?"

TITLE: Me [18M] and a newly met girl online [22F] What do i do now?

POST: So I recently posted on CL looking to meet with someone new in my area for nothing too serious but something that could develop in the future and I got messaged by a girl who was interested. We Exchanged numbers but have been talking online more. 

Our plan was to get to know eachother and then maybe meet up and go on a date but in the few days we have been in contact she hasn't been engaging me in any convos. I text her and she doesnt respond but does when she is online through skype. I don't know if its a change of heart without telling me or something else but I really want to talk to her more but not come off like im pushing too hard or acting like a stalker.

She initially gave me her number and sent me a photo of what she looks like without me even asking so it doesnt seem like she isn't interested, and when I do initiate a convo she replies to me, but every time I bring up the idea of talking in person or arranging to meet up she seems to either not reply or ignore answering the question, and I cant work out why seeing as our main intention was to meet up!

So what do I do now to get her to talk to me and/or want to meet up without seeming like im being forward?

TL;DR:","  Met girl online, plan was to meet up but she hasn't been engaging me in any way and seems to ignore my attempts at talking to her.

POST: I've been dating this guy for just over a month, but we've spent pretty much every second of our free time together. As in 6 sleepovers a week, and Friday night - Monday morning without a second apart. So it feels a lot more serious than your average one-month relationship. 

He invited me to spend Mother's Day weekend with them. They live a few hours away. I would not be going home for the holiday anyway, so that is not a factor.

My questions:

1. Is it too early to spend a whole weekend at his parents' home, regardless of the holiday?

2. Is it too early to spend what I consider to be an important family holiday with his family?

My instincts are telling me that I should just wait at least another month, but I don't want my declination to put a damper on the relationship or hurt his feelings.

TITLE: Could use some advice...

POST: Fair warning, this is my first post to Reddit, and I'm on mobile. Please bare with me.

A week ago, I decided to start a (hopefully) lifelong journey to slowly yet steadily improve my life. I bought a scale, and weighed myself at 340lbs. I wasn't nearly as upset as I probably should've been, considering I was expecting closer to 400lbs.

That very day, I took the first step. I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.

The next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! 

Now for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week. And I'm actually having trouble meeting this. Just wondering if I should be concerned if I'm not even coming close to the calories that are suggested I eat in a day. Note, I do NOT feel hungry.

TL;DR:","  Was 340lbs, started tracking calories, discovered I don't over eat, and have cut out soda completely. Still not meeting the calorie goal I set for myself. Should I be concerned?","  Having difficulties meeting my calorie goals, and sometimes end up 100s below an already low goal (for someone my size), should I be concerned?"

TITLE: Me (23F) with my boyfriend (26M) - how do I get over something that wasn't his fault but is still causing anxiety and insecurity?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months, and now, things are wonderful. However, while I logically acknowledge his, it's hard for me to feel it emotionally. 

Early on in our relationship (March-mid June), he underwent a lot of life stress that caused him to become a completely different person - he was distant, doubting the relationship for no good reason, regularly 1-3 hours late to meet me, etc. We talked about breaking up (amicably) but we didn't. During this time, I tried my best to be understanding and I basically put aside my needs (e.g. affection or wanting to hang out more) so that he could have space to deal with his stress. As a result of everything, I became a little depressed and also incredibly, frequently anxious about everything.

Now, he is back to being wonderful, affectionate, supportive, and considerate again. However, because I've been habituated to negative norms for those 3 months, I have a hard time re-setting and accepting the new norm. Even though things have been good for 2 months now, I'm still  cripplingly anxious. I still don't give him the benefit of the doubt. I still worry that we are on the edge of breaking up. 

We've talked a lot about this and we don't know what to do. I know that his feelings and actions in his stressful period are no longer relevant or applicable. He's debunked some of my worries, like my fear that he doesn't think our relationship is good. He's working to address my needs. I know I need to get over the past, but I don't know how. My pent-up emotions are now bubbling over and I'm more irritable, negative, and accusative, but I don't want to be. It's not that I can't forgive him, since he didn't do anything wrong, but I don't know how to change my fearful, anxious mindset and cognitive distortions of the present. 

Does anyone have any thoughts, advice, or similar stories? Thanks!

TL;DR:","  Boyfriend went through a lot of stress early in our relationship, which negatively affected our relationship. Now things are great again but I still have lingering anxiety and worry about the past. How do I get over it?",  Boyfriend went through a super stressful time that put a strain on our relationship.

TITLE: I [17/M] have a crush on a girl [16/F], we're good friends and I wanna get a relationship going, how/where to start?

POST: Hello everyone, this is my first time asking the internet for advice on something but I really want this to work out for me.

So basically; this girl and I have known each other for about 4-5 years and we're pretty good friends and we get along pretty well, I'm good at making her laugh and she's great to talk to.

When it comes to relationships, I've never even been in a semi-serious one before, although I'm after a stable, happy relationship that revolves around actual love and caring for each other, rather than the increasingly more typical ""whoo, relationship means sex!"" kind of relationship, what I'm trying to say here is I want this to count.

I don't really want to go into too much fine detail here, but I'm after advice on how to get the ball rolling, whether digitally or in person. (I know in person makes them feel more special, but if I can't muster the courage, nobody's gonna be feeling special but me after I blow my chance.)

Would it be better to ask her on a date? Just tell her how I feel about her and see her response, then move forward or withdraw depending on the response? Or the typical ""Will you go out with me?"" kinda thing.

Now let's say we get this going, then what? We're both currently attending school, I don't have a job, so I have little to no income, so movies and dates can't really be a common thing, maybe occasional... maybe...

I'd just like to reiterate that I lack confidence with relationships to the point I am actually slightly depressed (Not attention seeking, just elaborating on the case, haha).

TITLE: Is he just not that into me? 26f

POST: (repost from /r/okcupid because I'm dumb)

Ok, I feel like such a high schooler having to ask this, but I was hoping reddit could help me out here. I'm newly single and I feel like I'm completely lost trying to get back into the game.

So, I met a guy on okc. Things seem to be going really well. His picture wasn't that exciting, but we had a lot in common so I gave him a shot. He's funny, nerdy, loves all my favorite stand-up comedians, loves Firefly, blah blah blah. On paper, the perfect man. In person? He's also freaking GORGEOUS. And still funny and nerdy. He's the first guy I've met on okc who I felt genuinely excited about, rather than just cautiously optimistic.

So here's the rub: we've been on four fantastic dates, but he hasn't made a move. Not even a peck on the cheek. I'm starting to wonder if he's not attracted to me. He seems like the type of guy who's been a nerd his whole life, and doesn't realize he's hot, so his confidence might not be there. I'm tempted to make the first move, but I also suspect he's just old-fashioned, and that would completely turn him off. What do I do? How many dates do you all usually go on before it feels right to make a move? How do the men of reddit feel about the woman initiating?

TITLE: Me [26 F] with my BF [26 M] 5 years, I'm no longer sexually attracted to him

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years, we met in college and had one year together since then we've been long distance going from seeing each other every month for a weekend to now we have 7hrs between us and we see each other every 4-6 months. I will be graduating (Masters degree) in June and we had planned for me to move down to where he lives.

I truly love my boyfriend but our relationship has become stagnant, he's been depressed for a while and started taking meds for it (relevant in a bit), he seems to think that everything will be great when we're living together but the last two times I saw him (Christmas and Thanksgiving) had me reconsidering my relationship. He got absurdly drunk at two events we attended and it was mortifying, he stated it's because he's stressed, depressed and knew we would be parting soon, again. 

Bluntly, I am not attracted to my boyfriend sexually right now. Sex with him was a chore the last two times we saw each other (if I'm completely honest it's always not been the best), he couldn't finish because of his meds. Usually he can't finish inside me for whatever reason and instead jacks off which does nothing to make me feel desirable in this relationship. 

I love him but I question how well I know him, he is very closed-off and whenever I have pointed out concerns/issues he says it'll be better when we live together...

How do I fix this? I don't know what to do. My entire adult life so far has been tied up in this guy. I love him deeply but I feel dread at the thought of a lifetime of our current relationship/sex life. I tried to keep this concise, if you have any questions I can answer them in the comments.

I thought about it for a while, and concluded humans are similar to robots. From what I know, we have signals going through our bodies and neurons interacting to give us everything that makes us human (consciousness, self-awareness, etc). So I figure any type of artificial intelligence that reaches this level should be given the same rights, right?

Sometimes I have a really hard time coping with it. I guess I wanted to see if anyone had any advice they could offer? 

It's like this awful rollercoaster sometimes. I can't believe he did such a hurtful and selfish thing to me, and to the other woman. She and I have talked at length, and while it's been helpful at answering questions, it's also just something else to be sad about. 

I know he regrets what he did. He's taken full responsibility for it, he hasn't shied away from anything I need to ask, and he's gone the extra mile to show me he wants to earn my trust back. 

Honestly sometimes I just feel so broken. And I don't want to keep throwing it in his face because he's well aware he fucked up and it's something we can either move past or stay stuck at. 

I want to move past it. I am obviously hurt and angry with him, but also with myself. I feel like by staying with him, I am making what he did okay. Or that I'm not respecting myself. On the other hand, I know people fuck up, and I've never been one to give up on people.

POST: I have been dating my girlfriend for eight months now, initially casually and seriously since two months. She is American and we both live in the US, but I'm originally from Spain and my family still resides there. We are both going on vacation to Italy next week and have an eight hour layover in my home town. Although we haven't decided what to do during this time, it is quite likely that she will meet my parents.

My mother is disabled due to a severe stroke she had a few years ago and can no longer speak, walk, nor take care of herself. She stays at home with my father and has a nurse take care of her while my father works. I have not yet mentioned this to my girlfriend, partly because I have not found a good time to bring it up and partially because I am very reserved about sharing this information with other people. I believe I have also not completely made peace with the situation and have only ever confided it to my best friend and my now ex-girlfriend.

My girlfriend's family also has various medical issues, which she has always been very open about. Although I know that my situation is nothing to be ashamed of and that I have every right to avoid telling her until I feel comfortable, I can't help but feel a bit lousy about not telling her earlier. I just hope that she doesn't feel that I did not trust her enough to tell her without the pressure of her meeting my parents and that this has a negative effect on our relationship. The truth is that I absolutely trust her with this and that she is one of the most important people in my life, it's just that whenever I tried to tell her I got cold feet.

I guess all that I am looking for with this post is some reassurance that she will probably completely understand why I have withheld telling her and that I didn't do anything wrong or questionable.

However, she says the partying days are pretty much done, but I suspect that is because she goes to an online school, but that will change at the beginning of next year when she'll go back to a real high school because it looks better to graduate from.

Like today she, without telling me, went to a ""pool party"" as she put it, that consisted of her, 2 of her friends (both girls, and 4 guys. That made me extremely unsettled. Am I over reacting, or am I justified in being unsettled by this? I feel weak and insecure when I keep telling myself that I shouldn't be. Any advice on how to get over this?

First let me preface this by saying that I haven't dated in about 4 years.  My last relationship was during my junior/senior year in high school and it lasted almost 2 years before it ended badly.  Just thought you guys should know so you have some background info.

Now for where I need advice.  I haven't quite met this girl yet, but I saw her at my roommate's ex-girlfriend's apartment.  My roommate and I live just a few doors down from them.  Based on what I can gather from friends that went to high school with her and a quick glance at her facebook page, she seems like she would be a pretty good match for me.

So I guess the question that I am posing is how should I go about getting to know this girl?  Should I just outright ask my neighbors about her and if they would be willing to set me up on a date or invite her to a group get together type thing.?

If the latter option happens (group get together), any advice on how to know if I should ask on her on a date will be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR:",  Saw a girl at my roommates ex-girlfriend's apartment.  She seems like she would be a good match for me.  How should I go about getting to know her and setting up a date?,  Girl I want to pursue is a friend of my roommate's ex.  Not sure how to approach getting to know her.

TITLE: Help I [23/M] made the worst mistake of my life. GF [23/F](serious)

POST: I fucked up. I have been with my gf for 4 years and I was happy. I just threw all of that away 2 nights ago. I was drinking with some coworkers and it was this one coworker. I instantly regretted it and the morning of I told my gf my mistake. She cried and just ran out. I myself hate cheating too. I have a biological father who did that to my mother and I fucking did the same thing. She's on the other coast right now we were suppose to go together but I fucked up the previous night. We were planning on moving in together in September but I fucked it up. We haven't talked since she left. She said were on a break right now and we'll talk when she comes back in a week. I hate myself so much that I think the only way to make this right is if I just end myself so I can never hurt her again. I tried twice. My biggest fear right now is even if she takes me back it won't be remotely similar to what we had before. I don't think she'll be happy like that. I honestly don't know what will happen and I don't know if I can live with the results.

TL;DR:",  I cheated on my gf with coworker. She left immediately after I confessed. We haven't talked since. I hate myself so much and think the only way to make it right is to end myself.,  I cheated on my longtime girlfriend who I saw my future with. I'm scared and hate myself. I love her.

TITLE: I'm (18m) having trouble asking out my best friend (18f)

POST: I feel that this is going to be a long post. To start we're both in our senior year of high school and have known each other since sophomore year. When we first met I really didn't notice her that much and didn't talk to her until another friend introduced us to each other. After that we really hit it off well and I just thought we could be really cool friends.
Fast forward to next year and we have the same class again so we hang out constantly and try to partner up because we're both awkward around other people. (Side note we both are also on the swim team at our school so we naturally hang out a lot) People immediately notice and assume we're going out but we both fervently deny it as we're just friends. I was considering asking her out at this point, but was crushed when I found out she had just started going out with another guy before I could even ask. They break up at the end of the year because he was an asshole to her. 

Fast forward to this school year and I finally get her number so we're chatting pretty regularly and not relying on school to talk anymore. I'm finally getting my confidence up to ask her to homecoming just as friends so she wouldn't feel awkward when she tells me her friend introduced her to a football player from another school. They never date but he decides to take her to homecoming so I never even go just saying I hung out with friends that night. Except that my best friends date never showed up, and that she was forced to tag along with a friends group. At this point I'm getting frustrated and want to protect her from more bad relationships but I don't want to ask her out and ruin our friendship should it not work out. I only recently asked her to prom as friend after mustering my confidence and want to be able to try to ask her out then. I've never been in a relationship before because I hate the awkwardness that it causes but I really like her. Is there anyway I could tell her how I feel without ruining our friendship?

TL;DR:",  I really like my best friend but she's already seeing someone else before I can ask her out. Is there a way to tell her how I feel without ruining our friendship?,  Trying to ask out best friend but don't want to ruin our friendship should it not work out. What should I do?

TITLE: [24/M]I am having anxiety over the girl I'm seeing (24/F) because she's afraid to take the next step.

POST: Hello people, I am in need of some relationship advice.  To preface this I have to start by saying I've been cheated on in the past by 2 different girls one of which I was just shy of getting married to before she came clean...so I'm not the most trusting person in the world anymore.
I have been seeing this girl for about 3 months now and when I first met her roughly 4.5 months ago she still had a boyfriend. I am aware that this looks like a rebound thing but he was a long distance bf and we've taken things very slow because I wanted to ensure that I was not a rebound. Things have been going smoothly with us and we get along very well. Over the summer she got another job and is moving to a new place (which is closer to her work and to me coincidentally) so she has not had as much free time to spend with me the last few weeks. Here is my problem, she is afraid of commitment especially since she just got out of a 2 year long distance relationship and she does not want to commit to becoming official. Another reason is that she has very little free time lately because of the new job and getting her house ready for the move. I have a growing fear that she doesn't want to commit because she wants to ""shop around"" I have this anxiety even though we have had the exclusive talk.  

So how do I bridge this gap of where we are in the relationship?

TITLE: TIFU by Being Nice

POST: So I met this guy at the beginning of the school year, thinking that he was a pretty cool dude to hang out with. I was nice to him, cause he was nice to me.

Fast-forward to a few months later. I'm sitting in class, next to him, and I see flecks of white stuff coming out of his mouth. Like those little wet white boogers that you sometimes get. I was concerned about this, not for his sake, but for mine, as I didn't want any of that crap getting on me or my stuff. I decided to keep a close eye on him from then on.

I wonder now whether or not if knowledge is better than ignorance, cause I go through a living OCD hell of one huge dilemma; getting the fuck away from that disgusting boy.

He rotates his jaw while his mouth is closed, and then professionally blows out a ball of condensed phlegm, just like how those Amazon tribes blowdart animals for food. He spits out his inner mucus around his radius of 5 feet, splatting everything with that fucking disgusting fluid of his. He spits on the inside of his shirt, on his hands, on his pants, on his comb, on his backpack, on other people; basically everything.

I could perhaps tolerate his presence if he didn't spit on his dirty fat paws, and start using them to touch other things. Worse, he's a very touchy feeling kinda person, so he tries to touch other people and me. I try to avoid him like the plague, but he has some kind of a homing sensor and he pops out everywhere I go.

I don't know what to do. I fucked up by being nice to him, and he's trying to get close to me; literally and physically. Redditors, what should I do?

TL;DR:","  Guy I was nice to spits on everything he touches, including me. I try to avoid him, but he has a homing sensor and pops out everywhere I go.

POST: I really could use some insight. 

If you look in my history, my girlfriend was disillusioned to my friendship with my ex. I since cut off contact with my ex, have had many long talks with my girlfriend. 

My girlfriend is still upset. Very upset. I have taken her on a few dates and we still spend time together, but she isn't really enjoying herself. She wants me to ""wow"" her with well-planned dates and extra time and effort.

That's fine with me! If that's my penance, I am not afraid to do it. However, since the event (a week ago) she hasn't contributed anything to the relationship. She's happy on dates and upset when I don't plan anything.

TITLE: I [17/F] don't know if it's appropriate to give my number to a guy [18/M] who went on a couple dates with my friend's [17/F] older sister [19/F].

POST: About a year ago, this guy asked my friend's sister to prom. He was interested in her, and she basically had no interest in him. She said yes, but only as friends. Even after this he clearly still had feelings for her. She didn't really have any interest in dating him, but she thought maybe she'd try going on a couple dates with him. She wasn't sure if she genuinely wasn't interested or she was just scared because she hadn't really had any relationship experience before. 

I know this guy because we have a class together and we sit together. He's somewhat shy, but sweet and funny. We've spent some time together, we co-led a group of kids at a volunteer event, and obviously I'm around him every day. I definitely have at least some feelings for him, and I can't really tell if he reciprocates, he's just generally a very quiet person.

Him and my friend's sister went on a few dates, and as it turned out it was somewhat awkward and very very platonic. Neither of them attempted to make any move on the other, and things were generally very tense. Like, sitting down and having a pro-cons conversation about kissing eachother and then not kissing eachother tense. She plans on breaking whatever this is off with him the next time she sees him, but she doesn't even know if this will be necessary because they haven't even hung out in a month. Any interest that either of them had is dead.

As I said earlier, I kind of like this guy. Graduation is soon and we'll soon be going our separate ways, though we'll still be in the same area. Should I just give him my number, whether it turns out to be platonic or not? Or should I just steer clear?

TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [26F] of 3 months, how do I get over my insecurities around all of the interests/activities he and his ex share?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been ""official"" for three months, dating for five months. He is still friends with his most recent and ""big"" ex. I have hung out with her at a couple of parties and we even had dinner together just the two of us a couple weeks ago to get to know each other better. She has been really nice to me and told me she is happy that he found me, wants us to be friends, etc, etc. Both of them have assured me that there are no residual feelings and I have no reason to doubt them- that isn't the issue here. 

The issue is that I feel insecure with all of the history/interest that they share that he and I don't share. For example, they dated for 2 years, traveled internationally together, have the same friend group, have a lot of the same interests like mountain biking, going to music festivals (e.g. Bonnaroo), and they are even working together on some local events (e.g. planning a TEDx). 

He and I get a long really well, communicate well, and have even done a 6 day trip to the Mexican jungle together, but I can't help but feel intimidated by all the aspects that they share that he and I don't. It makes me feel kind of like the odd man out? For instance this summer they will probably go (with other people) on mountain biking trips- something I am just not into. I hesitate to bring this up to him, because there isn't really anything he can ""do"" about it. 

So, how do I stop feeling insecure about this and start feeling better?

TITLE: 32/m with 31/f for 6 months - She is secretly checking her ex's facebook every night, texting/crying once a week.

POST: I'm wondering how to handle this situation and if my GF is really ready for a relationship based on some of the things I have seen. She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.

I checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. 

That said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.

I don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.

I really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.

TITLE: I'm (25,m) confused about my relationship with my ex (23,f), who I dated 7 years ago.

POST: This girl (we'll call her Claire) was my first gf ever back in hs. We dated for about a year but distance drew us apart. Our breakup was a little messy and for a few years we didn't talk. Fast forward and we began texting again 'as friends'. We both moved back to our hometown after college and I expected us to have a great friendship, as that's what we both wanted. In my eyes a friendship would consist of hanging out, doing things together, etc.

Ever since she moved home she refuses to hang out with me one on one, as she believes it's 'too close to bf/gf'. As much as I would try to get closer with her she would equally push me away. However, her and I text all day every day, she tells me all of her closest secrets and innermost thoughts, we talk on the phone about her problems etc.

I'm really confused about all of this. She treats me 'like a boyfriend' via text/phone but she treats me as LESS THAN a friend in person. I finally decided to bring my frustrations up to her and mention that 'it's our last year possibly ever in the same state (before grad school) and that I wished things went differently etc. She took this as me confessing my love and told me 'too bad but I don't feel the same way.' Basically a generic 'friend-zone' response that she has sent to multiple guys before.

I really don't know what to do anymore but it's wearing on me. I have tried to bring things up to talk about what relationship we have and she completely blows me off month after month. And yet I'm still there anytime she needs to talk about issues or even other bf issues (which i told her to not bring up to me multiple times) On one hand I feel like I need to do what's best for me. Which includes slowly cutting her out of my life. On the other hand we've been 'friends' for so long now that I'd feel awful 'abandoning her'. I feel like I love this girl and it sucks. Idk what to do anymore.

TITLE: TIFU by bumming a guy two smokes

POST: This was about an hour ago, here's some context
I'm at a Mini Makers Fair which is a family oriented event that showcases technology, kids programs and other things associated with ""makers"".. basically creative tech fair for yuppie families.
Whatever.
I was helping display my friends interactive musical sculpture.

My point is I was at a nice family event and not just hanging out on the streets of downtown or somewhere more likely to get swindled.

I was taking a cigarette break and piddling around on my phone.
A guy cursing, looking into his empty pack spots me and asks if he can ""buy a couple smokes off me""
On average the going rate for an American Spirit is $0.35, $0.50 if someone is feeling generous.

I, out of habit, act put off whenever someone tries to bum smokes off me. This is to give them a chance to rescind their offer without me saying ""No"" outright. 
It's something I started doing with my friends who are chronic bums so they realize I'm not an endless free cigarette machine.

But, the guy offered to buy right? He had his wallet out, right? 
I busted out two smokes for him which he takes with a thanks me briefly.
I'm still kinda absorbed partially in my phone but notice he pauses and then starts to walk away.
""I'll be right back with something for you"" he says.

I guess I figured he might work at one of the booths that have some cool, silly swag for me? But I remembered thinking it was weird he took his wallet out and then didn't give me any money.
Maybe he didn't have any single dollar bills?
I waited around for quite awhile after.

Just lame because I'm generally pretty generous but it's situations like this that make that generosity go into hiding for awhile.

TL;DR:","  guy tried to bum smokes off me at a family friendly event, I politely declined and waited around for awhile after. Turns out he didn't have any money.",  guy offered to buy smokes off me and then just took off without giving me anything instead. I blame myself for being ignorant of peoples petty greed.

TITLE: [WA] Landlord failed to transfer power service after promising to do so

When I went into the leasing office to sign my new lease I asked if I had to do anything special to change my power utilities account to my new apartment. They said that all I had to do was fill out a form that they had with them, and they would transfer the service for me.

Well, they didn't transfer the service, they only added an account, and I got charged for 2 months of power for an apartment that was leased to someone else.

She was really into her video slot so I said I had a good night, and told her I was leaving (politely). She gave me a half hug, did not look up from the machine to make eye contact nor did she thank me. Some other odd things she did: told me to tip more (15% wasn't enough) then complained about the service, how her legs got sweaty because it was too hot, smoked and blew towards me when she knew I am asthmatic, then ordered more complimentary bread at the end of the meal and ate it.

TITLE: Seeking advice for non-traditional co-ed shower

POST: My fiancé and I don't like the notion that the wedding is all about the bride — he's getting married too! So, for instance, we will both be escorted down the aisle. 

My mom and some friends are hosting a wedding shower for us. I am adamant that it is not a *bridal* shower — it's for both of us. In keeping with our non-traditional-ness, **we would like to invite people who are important to us, no matter their genitalia**. 

My mom thinks we should invite all our friends' significant others, since it's a co-ed shower. But some of these people we haven't met or have only met a few times. They certainly wouldn't make the list of ""people most important to us."" 

Things get a little complicated if we don't invite the SOs, because my mom wants to put ""co-ed shower"" on the invitation (so she doesn't get inundated with calls like this: ""Wait, did you mean to address this to Amy AND John?""), but **I don't want people with long-term SOs to feel shafted because the SO wasn't invited**. We don't exactly want it to be a ""couples shower"" — just a gathering of people close to us. 

Any advice? Maybe an alternate name we could give the event so people still understand it's a shower and that it's okay to come if you're a man? We don't want the guest list to get so big that it's basically another wedding. (Plus, space is an issue; it'll be held at my parents' house.)

TITLE: CC transfer student need help with deciding on major.

POST: Hey everyone, 

This is my third year at community college and I'm going to be applying to colleges this year. 

Throughout the years at community college, I've been thinking about what kind of major I should be doing or career path after college. I've never had solid grasp on what I wanted to do, so I usually followed what my parents and friends guided me towards. 

In my first year at CC I thought about majoring in computer science, but after taking some programming classes I was shocked to find out it was completely different from what I thought computer science was. 

Then in my second year, I thought about doing electrical engineering because my dad told me it was a safe and stable major to choose, also because he works in a engineering company himself. I thought to myself this was going to be the major I'm gonna stick to, but after getting obliterated by physics classes I was discouraged and changed my mind about engineering major. 

Now here I am in my third year, still debating what major I should be considering. However, I was considering maybe majoring in mathematics because it is somewhat related to a career path I was interested in, which is cryptography.  

However, I've read about some stories about math majors who've went onto upper division classes and ended up changing their majors because it was not what they expected. I'm aware of what the upper division courses for maths are like because I've looked up some problems people post, and it does terrify me quite a bit. 

I guess I'm worried because if I do end up majoring in mathematics, I may end up switching my major when I transfer because I don't have enough guts to handle it. 

I'm sure a lot of people on here had similar problems or anxiety like me, having doubts about one's ability, how did you guys decide on your major and what advice can you guys give me? 

Sorry for my disorganized post, my thoughts are jumbled up so I can't put together my thoughts well together. I appreciate any feedback or comments.

Should I write my ex a love letter telling her how I feel? Should I call her once a day? Or should I just move on and try to find another girl like her? I do not want her to be the one that got away, and cannot seem to move on no matter how hard I try. She was basically my polar opposite, but I suppose that's why we were so attracted to each other.

Does true love just fade away? Why hasn't she even attempted to contact me this past month and a half when that's all I've been trying to do is to get a hold of her. Life seems so meaningless without her and I really don't know how to deal anymore. There are tons of suitable partners around me but I don't feel the same way about them to any degree.

I'm really just looking for any kind of advice. I love her, she loves me, but she can't seem to get over the fact that I asked if she was being unfaithful a couple of times. When the fight occurred I was 2 weeks behind on all of my school work and in the middle of a project, so I was stressed as hell in the first place, and then she being REALLY SARCASTIC which I struggle with regardless. These two things coupled together make me unbelievably furious, and I completely over-reacted. Not to mention how little sleep I was getting while I was with her. Should I be afraid to just show up to her house and give her the love letter I've been working on?

TL;DR:","  Ex dumped me a month and a half ago, can't get over her, can't stop thinking about her, can't stop thinking about her, can't stop wanting her back, can't stop feeling so depressed.","  I really miss my ex and can't seem to get her off my mind. Should I wait for her to break the no contact (because I already have), or should I just go to her house and see her in person?"

TITLE: TIFU by sending my girlfriend a photo of a shirt

POST: So, this just happened two weeks ago, and I'm just now facing the shit-storm.

My girlfriend does wild land firefighting. Well, so needless to say we are in a short-term long distance relationship. 

Back story: her and I have been friends for two years. We got together in March (Pi Day!), and she spent her vacation with me during spring break. Well, she and I had lots of sex and clothes were thrown everywhere.

Last week I was cleaning my room and I found a shirt at the foot of my bed, but inside the corner of the bed frame. So, I sent my girlfriend picture of said shirt and said, ""You left this here."" Well, she went home yesterday, and started looking through her stuff, and she had both shirts she had brought.

She sent me a text that said, ""We need to talk."" This is also known as, ""The four words that make your buttcheeks clench."" She calls me and tells me she has both shirts and has no idea whose shirt I have. I told her, ""Well, that makes two of us."" I honestly don't know. 

I'm not fucking around on her. The last time I had sex was in December (more than likely this one's), and then there was that fooling around thing with that girl from work at the beginning of January, but no sex happened. I'm not fooling around on her, but I don't want her to feel like I am.

Her tone says she is going to let it go, but I'm not trying to give her a reason to doubt me.

TITLE: Am I (21f) doing what is right for my daughter (3f) now that her father (23m) is dead or am I just ruining her life and my chances at potential relationships?

POST: My daughter is 3. Her dad (23m) is dead. Her dad and I(21f) were no longer together,(we were together two years but had been broken up for two years) however I am closer to his family than my own due to years of abuse and neglect with my family.

Multiple different men (26m&28m) are saying that if I want things to work out with him then I would need to cut my daughter's dad's family out of both of our lives because he and his family is going to take over their role.

 (Just to be clear I am not slutting around a lot, my daughter hasn't met any of these men... I just start talking to a guy, make it clear about her dad's family's role in her life and they basically tell me how they are going to take over that role and how her dad's family will start to not be involved. Then due to them saying how they don't want her dad's family in our lives I stop talking to them because I love her dad's family.)

Their basic reasoning is that her dad's family would undermine him and compare him to her deceased dad all the time. He doesn't know her dad's family and I know for a fact they never would. Also, the other part is that he believes he would become her only dad because he will be the one there for the majority of her life.. I feel as if they are wanting me to pretend her dad never existed and I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Am I being unrealistic thinking that all of this is wrong and that I need to avoid talking about my daughter's biological dad around her? Should I be acting like he never existed? I thought I was in the right to keep his spirit alive with my daughter because she really does act like her dad. And because I don't want her to forget him. But now I am worried that my view on this is skewed.

TITLE: My [15 M] and my friend [15 M] have been acting ""gay"" for each other as a joke between us, but he just came out and is actually gay.

POST: I have been friends with this person for a few months now, and we honestly get along very well. He's a funny guy, and we play a lot o' games together as bros. Whenever we're out together or at some sort of group gathering, we jokingly always act as though we are secretly deeply in love with each other and get all touchy. And up until now I thought he was straight, so I didn't really think much of it. (For reference, I am a bi-curious straight male.)

Anyway, today he finally came out to me and a select few as gay after realizing he felt this way roughly 2.5 years ago. I was really happy for him, because it was honestly a huge weight off his shoulders and it makes me happy knowing that he feels better about this. However, now I feel incredibly awkward. I'm not sure whether or not it's still okay to do the whole ""gay couple"" act with him at this point, because I don't want to play with his feelings like that knowing that it might not necessarily be an act on his part.

I am going to try talking to him when I get the chance and see what he says, but he's notorious for not giving very clear answers and I don't want to pressure him so soon after he has built up the courage to come out to me and a few others. But I don't know whether or not it's still okay to do this, and I'm not sure whether or not he might even have feelings for me, since he doesn't really do the ""gay couple"" thing with anyone else. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

TL;DR:","  My friend and I have been acting gay as a joke between us for a while now, but he recently came out to me and a few others and is now actually gay.

TITLE: A question of character

POST: I (24f) have lived a very sheltered life,have been quite abused (in all categories), and struggle with many health issues. What I am beginning to see in not just my SO of 5 years but others is how different their characters are from mine. 

Friends, it does not really bother me much. I mean i sometimes trip out on what they say and their selection of words but I don't seem to judge them as much as my SO (obviously). 

I have been noticing that my SO, in various situations would do something that in my opinion would be morally wrong. The thing is, all of them are literally hypothetical. Like we would watch a movie or read about something and he would say, ""oh if that was me I would have totally done blahblahblah"". Usually the blahblahblah part is something that I find totally the wrong thing to do morally. 

I was raised in a very abusive household and yet i'd not hesitate to open doors for elderly, try to help out homeless, and I am not against the world at all. My SO is opposite but he is totally affectionate to me and it just seems like his words do not match his actions towards me and those who are close. 

Should I be worried about this? I understand everyone is different and I totally respect people for their choices but it just seems like my SO would be a villain in most hypothetical situations whereas, I would be a hero. 

Has anyone ever encountered something like this? Is it a red flag? I mean he has loved me through all my faults, disabilities and handicaps which I think takes someone special to do so. Also, he is not abusive or negative to me or anyone at all.

TL;DR:",  I have noticed that my SO's actions and words do not match his words and I am concerned about his character. Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Is it a red flag?,  My SO is more of a Slytherin whereas i'd be in Gryffindor for lack of better example. His hypothetical choices scare me.

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [22F] says she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. What should I do?

POST: Just like it says on the tin. My SO of 2.5 years recently admitted to me that she didn't initially find me attractive, although she claims that changed after she got to know me.

I certainly understand that a person's overall attractiveness is a function of their personality, and one's level of attraction to a person can change over time, I'm very upset that she never felt any *physical* attraction for me. 

It's great that she's ""attracted"" by my personality and all, but I can't help but feel that this isn't good enough. I thought she was physically attractive right away. I feel pretty terrible about myself that she didn't feel the same way. I don't want to go on in a relationship where I feel that I'm not good enough for her.

I still love her very much, and I know she loves me. I'm pretty crushed at finding this out, and I don't know what to do about it. It seems to me that she was immature to think she could have a satisfying relationship with someone she didn't click with physically. I want her to be happy, so I can't help but wonder if we need to break it off so she can find someone who actually works for her physically.

Is this an overreaction? I think I'm emotionally compromised because I'm so upset about this. So I'm hoping for advice from a few smart people here.

What should I do? Is there a way of understanding what she's told me that doesn't make it sound so bad? What am I missing?

TITLE: How did you escape disaster? I'll start.

POST: 8 years ago, as a sophmore, me and my buddies went to his car and smoked a bowl between classes, we show up to our next class about 5 minutes late, and the teacher being a bitch said we had to go to the office and sign in, so we do, and the office secretary obviously knew we were high so about 10 minutes after signing in, we're called into the office, I had a pipe and a 10 sack in my backpack so at this point I was shitting bricks, they placed me in this small ass 4x4 printer room with the yard duty. I knew I was screwed because the room was so small I had no chance to hide my stuff. I opened the small pocket of my backpack where everything was, and took out a pencil. I started twirling the pencil around in my hand and noticed that the yard duty was watching the pencil, so i keep doing that and then I flick it up in the air. As it falls to the ground, I reach for it, and with my other hand I grab my pipe and slide it under the printer. When my principal was done interrogating my friend I was called in. She had just escorted him to another room to sit until they figured out to do with us. I walk out the printer room, see she is across the room from her office, so I B-line into her office grab the weed and put it on the book case. Cop gets called in to search my things, and he's tripping because he keeps saying he could smell it. It was literally behind his head nose level. After searching my stuff 4 times he gives up. They lock me in the office and tell me to wait while the police officer talks to my principle. When I was alone for about 5 minutes, I took the weed off the bookcase and hid it in her desk drawer. I ended up getting suspended for being high and they tried to tell my mom I have a drug problem and wanted me to go to rehab. My mom pretty much laughed in her face and told her it's just marijuana. Never heard about it again, but the teacher did ""resign"" at the end of the year.

TITLE: Moved into guy's Apt and Moving Out 1 month in. Who finds replacement?

POST: Hello,
I don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.

My question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- 
•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?
•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?
•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?
•	How can I protect myself in this situation?

I literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.

If I posted in to the incorrect subreddit, lemme know.

Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!

TITLE: I [m/18] got involved with a girl [f/19] in a relationship, but she doesn't know how to leave her bf.

POST: A couple of months ago a friend and I started developing feelings for each other. She had been in a relationship of 3 years and often told me how unhappy she was with the relationship and how poorly he treats her. Things between us started getting serious and their relationship started falling apart. 

Being college students on winter break, we began hanging out every day for the past month. I could tell she was finally accepting that she could leave him. We make each other very happy and often discussed our own relationship and the future. 

Just as I thought she was finally mustering up the strength to end it with him, his mother was diagnosed with cancer. Being together with him for 3 years, she is very close with his family and thinks leaving him would be too much for him to handle. She told me she doesn't want to lose me but can't risk hurting him right now. 

Obviously it's a difficult situation and I'm understanding, but I can't help being upset knowing that she isn't happy. I want to make her happy and I know I can but I'm not sure what to do at this point. And no, I don't want to hear that I shouldn't have gotten involved with her in the first place.

TITLE: Giving my[29m] gf/fiance [23f] an ultimatum - am I wrong?

POST: She has extremely controlling/manipulative parents, and she's from a foreign culture. In practice, this means that she can't actually do anything with me beyond spending a few hours together, though we've been a couple for the past couple years. ""It's not right"" for her to spend the night at my place, even though I reside pretty far away; ""It's not right"" for her to go on a trip with me to visit my family in Los Angeles, which is pretty far from the Midwest; ""It's not right"" for us to go on weekend trips, because that would look bad to the gossipy neighbors/community.

This is from her and her parents. I asked her to get married a while ago, and she agreed, though said she wouldn't tell her parents until after she got her Master's degree, which is a couple years from now, as she somehow owes it to them to finish not just a regular college career, but all of graduate school, before she gets married.

It's been a while, and I have her the ultimatum: either we get married next year, you give up this cultural stuff that keeps us apart and actually do some things with me, or we part ways.

She's upset, of course, and doesn't like that I've given her such an ultimatum. I feel guilty about it; should I? Am I doing the wrong thing?

You should know I'm a guy with his pride. So when my SO started mocking my coordination for tripping over stuff, I got pretty mad and decided to prove to her that my coordination is perfect. Needless to say, just a few days later I was roaming the neighbourhood on my brand new unicycle while juggling some tennis balls (3, to be exact). 

That's where the fuckup begins. One sunny day I was riding around the area when suddenly this ice cream truck appears from behind the corner and heads for me. I could do nothing but watch the kid behind the steering wheel desperately try to stop the truck - luckily, at the last moment he realised he can simply turn the wheel, so he did not break every single one of my bones, just a few ribs and a hip dislocation. 

Turns out was also the time when a lot of illegal immigrants began to come over here - god bless you, Merkel - so some employers felt like it was a perfect opportunity and 'hired' many those people for some shitty money without any contract or training. What's even worse is that the kid driving was quite literally this - a kid. 

We finally agreed not to call the police after he promised me a free vanilla scoop every time he was around. My SO was super mad and my unicycle went straight to the garbage can, but damn me if it wasn't worth it.

TITLE: TIFU By drunkenly making out in someones bathroom

POST: So this literally just happened last night and I am typing whilst recovering on my sofa. I go to pretty intense Uni, UWO, both for work and for partying and last night I went to a friends house warming party. People were chilling music was bumping etc. Essentially I consumed 1/2 a bottle of Jack Daniels and 1/2 a bottle of tequila and somehow managed to chat up a girl, will call her J. One thing lead to another and we headed to the bathroom. As we were furiously making out and taking of our clothes, I somehow managed to slip and fall straight into the tub with her, which would have been fine, if not for the fact my head slammed against the soap holder in the tub.

The thing smashes into pieces and my head starts bleeding. A lot. My entire chest is covered in my own blood in a very short span of time. I can't feel much because of the alcohol and now J is kidda freaking out (understandably). She gets toilet paper and gets we to put pressure on the wound whilst she calls an ambulance. When we are leaving, the whole party is freaking out because they think the cops will show up. I essentially spend all night at the hospital, getting stitches whilst J (bless her) keeps me company. I ended up with 18 stitches on the side of my head. But I did get to stay at Js after I got released from hospital!

TITLE: USPS mysteriously sent me someone else's package - readdressed it to me [US]

POST: Mysterious situation. Sorry about the text wall. Located in the United States.

A few months ago, I bid on (and won) an auction for tools and other supplies on a popular online auction website. The package was mysteriously delayed during shipping at one of USPS's sort facilities due to what I assumed was the rather extreme inclement weather.

Once I received the package, I found a letter from the postal service INSIDE the box stating that due to a mishap at the facility there were packages that became dislodged during shipping. If any problems arose to send a letter to their complaint department. The package did not contain the tools but rather an incredibly large number of sealed DVD sets to a very popular TV show. 

I contacted the seller and he had no idea what I was talking about with DVDs. He stated that he sent only the items pictured in the auction. I have no reason to believe that he was being disingenuous because when you compare the price of both items on Amazon, the overall value of the DVD sets is much, much higher.

After some back and forth with the USPS I was able to reach someone who started an official search at the three USPS sort facilities in the region. After three months they terminated the search and stated that my item was not found. I also inquired what to do with the DVDs that I received. Initially they said to keep them sealed because if my original package was found, they may need me to send the DVDs back to the sort facility. But later they essentially told me on the phone that they didn't know what to do with the DVDs.

Months have gone by, and I decided to try and recoup my money so I've started selling them locally. I've only sold a handful, but I began to wonder what kind of legal ramifications I could run into ? Also I became paranoid that the DVDs may contain some kind of elicit or illegal material so I unwrapped several of them and skimmed through them on my computer. I could not find anything out of the ordinary. They appear to simply be the entire DVD set of the TV series.

TL;DR:",  USPS sent me a package that contained sealed DVD sets of a popular TV show. Months later I've begun selling them locally. What legal ramifications could I face if I opened them and found nothing illegal?,  Mysteriously sent huge box of boxed DVD sets of a popular TV show. USPS lost my original package.

TITLE: I'm [21M] torn between where to go. Confused about 2 women, both [20F]. Been in a relationship with one for ~1.5 years.

POST: Hi all. So I've got quite a long story here, but I'll try and keep it as short as possible. 

So to begin, me and a woman I dated for 3 years broke up nearly 2 years ago. Contact was cut completely within 3 months, and I haven't spoken with her since. Around that time she began dating another guy. A while after this, I also began dating another woman. 

So me and this woman have dated for the past 1.5 years roughly, and things have definitely had more downs than ups. We have fought constantly, never seen eye to eye, and don't share any hobbies. 

My ex and I, on the other hand, completely got along, would have a few big fights here and there, and shared mostly the same hobbies. 

My current girlfriend and I have been on and off for the past few months, and right now we're in a hiatus. But, for the past few weeks, I've caught myself thinking about my ex more and more, and I'm not sure why. I hadn't thought about her in a long time, and lately I can't seem to get her out of my head. I legitimately miss her.

So through the grapevine, I've heard that my ex and her boyfriend aren't exactly doing the best, and things are falling apart. I want so badly to text her or something. But I just don't know if it's right. 

Can anybody give me advice here? I'm absolutely lost and confused right now. Thanks to anyone who can help!

TL;DR:","  Still think about ex 2 years after relationship ended. She's dating someone else now, and things are falling apart. I miss her so much.

TITLE: This is my mom's amazing giant kitty Bart. (He was named by the shelter.)

POST: My mom adopted him in late 2009. He was sent back from the shelter TWICE, despite the fact that the shelter strongly warned the adopting families that Bart was a mature, independent cat who didn't do well with children and needed to be the only pet. Apparently, when he was returned, it was because he was ""mean."" My mom adopted him, let him do his own thing in the house, didn't get in his space at all, a month after she adopted him he jumped into her lap.

Now, he follows her from room to room. He's friendly and loving to both me and her, and loves sitting in our laps- which can be a problem, because he's a HUGE cat who weighs like 18lbs! He's a giant panther cat stalking around, but he's a sweetheart, and even acknowledges and accepts strangers now (if they offer attention)!

Point being, if you're going to adopt, PLEASE make sure you listen to the shelter about the temperment of the cat. Cats are wonderful, loyal, loving creatures, but they are NOT submissive, they are NOT dogs, you CAN NOT ""train"" them (past a certain point), they will not BEND to you. You can support them and take care of them and they WILL love you undyingly, they will follow you around, purr in your lap and constantly try to attack your feet from under the bed. Just acknowledge that they are little people with personalities. :) Bart is a CHARACTER for sure. :)

TL;DR:","  My mom adopted a giant cat who was returned twice from the shelter. He is friendly and loving to both her and me, and follows her around like a champ.

TITLE: Help me plan our honeymoon, South America in summer?

POST: Hey /r/travel!

Me and the gf are getting married june 1st and are trying to plan the honeymoon. We have 8 weeks from end of june to middle of august to spend. Our plan is to spend 1-2 weeks home in Sweden and then go somewhere semi-adventurous for the remaining 6 weeks

Our initial plan was to go to South America, maybe start off in mexico and then finish off in peru or chile. From some reading from wikivoyage i got the feeling that most of SA has rain periods during summers.

My questions to you /r/travel are:

1. Will it rain a lot in central/northern america during july/august?
2. What would you recommend us seeing in these parts of the world? 
3. How far in advance do we need to book inca trail?

Our interests are mainly hiking/outdoors, adventures, sports and living some of the local cultures.

TITLE: How to be the peacemaker during mine [26/m] and gf's [26/f] terrible fights.

POST: I've been dating my gf for 11 months now and for a while I've been commuting 3.5 hours on 4 day weekends to stay at her place while I was in grad school.  Now that we spend all days together, we seem to bicker a lot.  In addition to the bickering, we'll have long 2+ hour arguments (at least once a week.  Sometimes 2 days in a row) that always, ALWAYS end with me thinking ""this is fucking crazy"" and just apologizing and eating my words and feelings to settle down the argument.  

In 11 months, I don't think once she's started the compromise/apology/or anything to end the argument.  She thinks I'm generally selfish and that I ""paint her out to be a bitch.""  And sometimes she'll straight up lecture me like I'm a child.  

It's really hard to always have to be the first one to say sorry.  And then take the blame for the whole argument.  

Sometimes she even throws stuff when she's really mad.  I'm also beginning to think she doesn't respect me at all.  

The worst part is - I'm TERRIFIED of being alone.  Before I met her, I had no real friends, no life, I spent way too much time on the computer.  With her, I can be engaged soon, be living with her in an apt, have a dog (her awesome dog), and cool friends (her really nice friends).  Without her, I'd live at my parents for a while, have very rare hangouts with very few friends, be lonely as hell.  She's a great package deal.  And the thing is, I really don't think I could do better than her at all.  She's beautiful, smart, and when we do get along, it's like a fairy tale.  We have a real strong connection and compatibility when we're getting along which is about 85% of the time.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend and I have a lot of arguments that always end with me apologizing and taking blame for the whole thing.  How can I be the peacemaker during our long and often very bitter arguments?,  how do I make peace with being the peacemaker and come to terms with swallowing my pride every time?  What do I do about the fact that I'm so much better off with her?

TITLE: Our friend [22M] is an an abusive relationship with [21F]. What can we do?

POST: I am friends with a soft spoken guy - we'll call him Chad - in our social group (all friends from college) who is in an emotionally abusive relationship. His girlfriend Christina pushes him around, dictates his schedule, speaks on his behalf, and has no qualms with tearing him down in front of everyone. A few incidents have occurred over the past few months that have really made the fact that Christina is emotionally manipulative and abusive hit home. The only problem? Chad either doesn't see it, or he's too afraid to leave for fear that we will choose her over him.

My boyfriend and I want to help Chad, but we worry that Christina is keeping him from interacting with us. Our invitations to him to hang out have gone unanswered and he often seems nervous to speak with us when in a group setting. We've decided that the best course of action is to get him alone, to talk to him, and to tell him that *we are here*, we see what's going on, and we want to help. He won't be alone if he leaves Christina; he will still have us (at the very least) there as a support system.

Of course, if this goes badly (if Chad doesn't leave and Christina finds out what's happened), it will cause **massive** chaos in our friend group. We will probably be unceremoniously punted from our social circle. 

What should we do? My boyfriend and I have discussed this at length, and we genuinely feel that someone needs to reach out to him and let him know that he is not alone. Emotional abuse can be absolutely soul searing, and we want to offer him a life jacket if he needs one. At the same time, we realize that this may be the beginning of the end of our group of friends. How can we approach this delicately?

TITLE: Past and present drug users/abusers/ and dealers, what are your craziest drug-related stories?

POST: An ex-friend of mine (let's call him rob) got hurt real bad a while back and was prescribed perc's for the pain. He wasn't into the idea of getting hooked on them so he barely took the pills. One day someone asked him for a free pill, and that's where the downfall began. Eventually and slowly Rob started to distribute the pills and began selling them. After seeing how fast the money came (over 20 grand in one month) he pretty much was the biggest perc connection in the area. 

At this point he was buying them illegally rather than getting them prescribed, so when his suppliers weren't able to meet the, he got about 20 grand together and flew to florida to get his pills. After finding a ""reliable dealer"" and testing some of the perc's, he was happy and bought them, then flew back. 

First deal back in my state, was a major one. Rob went to meet up with the buyer, and when they went to exchange the product, the pills... Were fake. All of them. In a single blow all his business was gone. 

Now this is where Robs luck truly runs out. Being a semi-small town where this was all happening, the cops caught wind after a few months. Rob had quit the dealing due to the fake pills, but barely a few days later, while Rob was at a fellow drug-dealers house waiting for pizza, things got suspicious. Their regular pizza guy wasn't the one deliviring, but it was a guy in his mid-40's. For some reason Rob opened the door, and immediatelywas bum rushed by 10 cops. 

Both Rob and his friend were placed under arrest. The cops found the 10000 fake percs, and looked like they hit the jackpot, thinking they were real . Fast-forward after court, percs were found as fake and all Rob got was a year in jail for possessing fake drugs.

TITLE: Sketchy job offer

POST: Long time lurker, first post ever. I'm looking for a bit of help trying to figure out if this potential job is legitimate. Regardless of my desperation, I'm typically rational when it comes to making big life decisions but last week, I received an email from a recruiter about a potential ""Project Management"" position from a VC from Delaware and all I had to do was apply on their website if I was interested. I was already sketched out but 2 things checked out: 1. Recruiter had a corporate email and 2. The website seemed really legit, so I thought that it wouldn't hurt to apply. There was no financial information requested, only my address and phone number as well as my references.

On Monday, I received another email, asking to schedule a phone interview. At this point, a lot of emotions take over and I request for a call at their soonest availability. The next day, I receive the call right on schedule by a female with a heavy Russian-ish accent. I was asked a couple basic questions like my typical workday and my career goals. It was very brief, 8-10 minutes but I immediately felt that I was being scammed. After the phone call I do even more research and found that the site has been active for only 21 days.

Today, I got an email about the next step from a Sr. in Human Resources. Attached was a contract for a one-month paid training which is apparently a part of their ""screening process"" before they decide to hire full time. Again no financial info was asked from me, just e-sign the document.

The document says that the corporate address is in Kowloon and I haven't been able to find ANY contacts on linkedin but they included a bunch of address for the new office in Los Angeles. I'm going to call all the numbers to see if I could speak with anyone. How should I go about all of this to find out if this is a real job and also a what is the best way to protect myself if it isn't?

James is bipolar and lives two hours away, and a few days after our great date, he told me that he didn't think he was stable enough for a relationship with that much distance (he's an artist so money is sporadic). I was pretty bummed, deleted him off of Facebook, and moved on.

fast forward to last week. I started dating someone after James and that relationship ended last week. by coincidence, a few days later James reached out to me to ask how I was and to say he'd been thinking about me. we decide we should hang out in the next few days and meet in the middle at a hotel (to spare the distance and because I needed to get out of my house). we get drunk, have sex, cuddle, have a great time, even spend the next day together going to a few shops.

now James and I are talking about striking up a FWB arrangement, but I guess I'm a little concerned. the emotions weren't there when we hung out last week but I think that has a lot to do with my relationship recently ending and I have a feeling that if we have sex regularly knowing that we already had strong feelings for each other at one point, it's going to turn into a relationship. I guess I just don't know if you can have one without the other in this situation.

any advice? anyone been in this situation and can share their experience? I wouldn't be opposed to a relationship with James way down the line and I think he knows that, but obviously with the distance and his instability, it's a little hard to gauge.

TITLE: My [30 F] colleague [28 F] is cherry-picking my responsibilities at work - what do I do?

POST: I've been working at my current company in the marketing department for 5 months, colleague in question has been there for one year. The company is a start up and only two years old. 

Recently, my colleague was given a lateral promotion of sorts: She's going from running our digital marketing to managing brand communications, as the former role wasn't really working out.  The head of our department (who hired me but didn't get along with her) resigned a few months ago. My colleague is temporarily being managed by the CEO, who told her to write her own job description.

Since this shift in her role a month ago, she's been suggesting to me and others that she now has some management authority over me and the work I do. It started with unwanted suggestions on how I should do my job and her cutting me off in meetings (she talks LOADS) but now is escalating to her trying to take elements that were originally in my job description for herself (i.e. blogger outreach) and delegating tasks to me. She's positioning herself as middle management but as far as I know no one has officially given her this authority.

It's clear to me that she has no direction in what she's supposed to be doing and is therefore trying to make herself look busy/important, but I'm finding it increasingly challenging to deal with her. Some of my colleagues have noticed this behaviour from her too and one said she's toxic to the business, so I'm trying not to take it personally.  However, the management team love her so I'm hesitant to say anything to my temporary manager. I realised today, though, that I am now miserable in a job I used to enjoy. What should I do? Should I try to talk to her or just bite the bullet and go to my manager?

TITLE: Agreed to meetup Saturday but haven't heard from since

POST: Hello reddit..
I need some advice. I've been talking with this girl for about 2 weeks now. We went out last weekend and it went great. We were working on setting up another date and she told me that she was concerned about distance (its about a 30 minute drive). I messaged her back and said that i agree with her but there are ways around it. Anyways, after that she messaged me that sue would like to try and said that maybe we could set something up for Saturday (tomorrow) i replied that that sounded great and i was looking forward to it. I havent heard anything since (this was tuesday night). Ive texted her a couple of times just wishing her a good day at work (no more than once a day). I'm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to text her again but its now been about 5 texts since her last response. Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR:",  agreed to meetup with girl but haven't heard from her since. She said she would like to try and set something up but nothing has happened since. What should i do?,  Went out with girl. She was concerned about distance but decided she wanted to try anyways. Set something up for saturday (no set time etc.) Haven't heard from her sense. 5 texts now with no response

TITLE: Me [21 M] hanging out with a bunch of girls too much a bad thing?

POST: I came home after being away the last couple of years. During my time away I developed a lot of confidence particularly around girls. I have been getting a decent amount of attention from girls who I feel are expressing interest, and I have dated some of them, whilst being friendly and texting others. 

I'm currently single and I wouldn't mind having a girlfriend but I'm just kind of going with the flow right now. Basically, I see a lot of potentials but I'm not really worried about making any moves, however I can sense signals. I'm just worried about making friends with too many girls and fear that I may be leading some on while I'm just happy being friends. I find myself hanging out with a lot of girls, I just enjoy their company more than guys. Is it bad to have too many friends that are girls? 

I am not trying to brag. I'm just a little concerned as to where this may be heading. Does reddit have any ideas/thoughts/ways to handle this?

TITLE: foreman won't talk to me

POST: Hey so I started this job two years ago. I am thinking of going elsewhere. I just wanted to confirm with you guys that I'm making a good choice.

When I started there, there was a co worker who started 4 months before who would berate me and yell at me and my foreman would go around telling everyone that this co worker was the best and best worker they have ever seen.
I went and told my boss about the verbal abuse and harassment after a month this co worker quit.

For the next 8 months this foreman than would glare at me and tell me to work harder and tell me I wasn't a good worker, among other things.
I did tell him to treat me fairly and that hey this isn't right.

So things settled for a while. Now for the last three months. He doesn't even talk to me at all anymore. He will talk through our work lead to talk to me.
I have tried talking to him but all i get is one word answers

I take it he's either just hates me or is intimidated to talk to me cause I stand up for myself.

I have been looking for a new job and might have a new one in two months. But it does eat me up a bit that it has gotten to this point and oh yeah he is nice to everyone (just wish he would grow up and talk to me about the problems he's having in his head with me)

TITLE: Long distance BF of 3 years (18M) doesn't seem that excited to see me (18F)

POST: My long-distance boyfriend is home for the weekend but he doesn't seem that excited to see me. I met him on his way back from the coach station yesterday evening, after I'd been at college and work. I just wanted to hug him and kiss him straight away, but he kind of just ignored that / didn't reciprocate. Example: I pulled him towards me and kissed him when we were walking up my street, just because I haven't kissed him for 3 weeks and I wanted to. It wasn't forced or anything, but then he kept saying we should stop because we're in the middle of the street (it was 10:30pm, no one else around) and we should 'save it for later' (I'm at college/work 'later').He also said the same thing, and that I was getting 'carried away', when we were kissing after he walked me home. Isn't that a good thing?

He is pretty shy and does tend to internalise a lot, but we're very close and open with each other. 

We've only been apart 3 weeks this time but found it more difficult than other times. It was all 'I miss you' texts, but now he's home... I don't know. 

I don't know if I've just got unrealistic expectations of what his reaction 'should' be. I kind of want him to jump on me and hug me and kiss me. I guess I just didn't feel that wanted. BUT I don't know if I'm just over romanticising / idealising the situation.

POST: Here's the post about our breakup a few weeks ago - 

Now I find myself thinking about her more and more each day. I know there were parts that weren't great, because I can read that post. However, we've had a little bit of contact here and there, but nothing about the breakup. Just chit chat things about finding a place to live and stuff. We're still friends on Facebook and Twitter and she *seems* like she's doing all right, but maybe she's just doing that to make me feel less guilty...? I don't know.

I guess I'm just not sure what it is I'm feeling. I thought I'd be able to just move on and be fine because I was never really emotionally invested. Am I just bothered because she *seems* all right or do I really care more than I think I do? I want to send her an email (yes, an email of all things) and tell her what I'm going through and that maybe I'd like to hang out some time soon. I'm just afraid of building her hope (and mine?) up and then letting us both down if that feeling isn't there again...I'm not sure what i want to do here and I just don't know exactly what it is I'm going through.

TITLE: TIFU by fishing down my top for money to pay for cigarettes.

POST: My mother and I recently passed an enjoyable week in Spain. On our last evening there, she remembered that my father had asked her to buy him some tobacco, as it's cheaper there than at home. So we wandered along the city streets of Madrid until we found a tobacco shop. I waited outside, then after a while she beckoned me in. She was twenty euros short, and remembered that she had given me 50 euros for emergencies. Which I had placed in my passport-carrier around my waist, under my clothes. While in airports getting out my passport simply involved lifting up my top slightly to remove my passport, on this evening I had chosen to wear a dress. Given that reaching under my dress to the purse would involve flashing my underwear to a shop of Spaniards, I decided that the most decent option was to plunge my hand down the top my dress, rummage for a while finding the zip on the passport holder, extracting the note and closing the zip, then to slowly remove my hand holding the 50 euro note without accidentally pulling up the dress. This attracted a fair few stares, and I was thankful to leave shortly afterwards.

TITLE: Hit a wall, or fell off a cliff, during my marathon training

POST: I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?

TL;DR:","  Was running consistently, but couldn't manage 3 straight miles consistently. Possibly due to travel, diet, or stress. Hit a wall, or fell off a cliff during marathon training.

POST: OK, so I've started to date (4 dates so far) this woman who is really nice. We met at a college extra curricular lecture and things have been going swimmingly. My issue is me I believe, and I really could do with some advice.

So I'm really inexperienced with women and I'm pretty much flying by the seat of my pants right now and just trying to keep my head above the water so I'm doing my best to try and not scare this woman away. In my quest to do this, I've realised that I haven't really initialised any physical contact and it has all come from her. So for instance, at the end of the second date she gave me a peck on the cheek as way of saying good night. After the fourth date, I was still scared of offending her by holding her hand and putting my arm around her (I not a smooth man!) and she ended to date by just gunning for it and sucking my face off (totally not complaining!). Anyway, I decided to text her that I really like her and that the reason I haven't made a move yet is because I wasn't sure she'd appreciate it. She text back saying that she's not looking to rush into anything and moving slowly is maybe the way to go but she really enjoyed the evening as is looking forward to our next date. What does she mean by this?

POST: 26, f here. I started having sex with this 31 year old guy I know through friends, thinking he was casual about relationships. 1.5 years later I suddenly find myself hearing about how I'm spending too much time with other guys and he doesn't feel like I'm that into him. I do try to make him feel loved, but I thought we agreed from the start that this isn't what we want.

We both want this relationship, but disagree on the terms. I don't want to be exclusive, but I want him. Why is it that the one who wants the exclusivity always seems to be more in a position to make demands, even when otherwise was specified from the start? The advice I get is ""Leave, you want different things"" or ""If you like him he should be enough"". Why is the jealous one assumed to be the one who'd have the hardest time giving the other person what they need? 

And yes, we have talked. He won't have it and he's making me feel like the one that's breaking us up. 

I'm not talking about fucking lots of guys, even kissing is off the table.

TITLE: (18/M) Don't know if I should pursue her(17/F), some opinions would be nice.

POST: So I just want to clarify that no I'm not a anti-social guy who is being friendzoned by a girl who is out of my league.

So I'm taking a friend of mine who is super pretty to my matric dance(prom) and I started becoming more interested in her after I asked her to go with me on a date. So I asked her and we are planning to go on a date after I finish writing my exams and before the dance(prom), and she seemed keen when I asked her so I guess that's something to go on. Also at the beginning of the year my one friend tried to set the both of us up to go out and from what he told me she was interested in me but it never happened because we just weren't comfortable with each other then and it was difficult to speak to her at first.

Now the problems start with the fact that I'm moving next year to another city 12 hours away from where we live to go to varsity. Now I stay committed when I get into relationships but long distance would be tough on me and I'm not sure about her. I brought it up with her before I asked her out that I'm going to be leaving and she seemed pretty disappointed by it.

The second problem for me is that this year was also the first time I've been in love with someone and the first time a girl rejected me when I asked her out - this is a long complicated story I don't wanna explain XD. Anyway some days she would pop up in my mind and I would get bummed out about it and also somebody in my grade is bringing her to the dance so that kinda sucks a little. After I stopped speaking to this girl that I fell in love with the girl I'm taking to the dance seemed to become a little bit more interested in me and started talking to me more often.

TL;DR:","  Interested in pretty girl, moving next year far away from where we live and she seems to have rejected me before. Should I pursue her or not?",  Not sure if I should go for this girl as I'm moving next year and there's some issues with a past love interest.

TITLE: My (22M) girlfriend (20F) of one year can't be alone and I am afraid it will drive us apart.

POST: I wanna preface this by saying I have two different questions,  but they both seem to stem from the same issue. 

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly a year now and the relationship has been great. We're both pretty different people,  but we have been able to work out whatever issues have come up except for this one; she cannot be alone and I feel like a dick when I need alone time. 

I spend nearly every waking moment with her and while I love the time we spend together,  I need some time to focus on myself and do some things I enjoy, like video games, that she doesn't want to be a part of. I rarely get any such time because she needs someone to be with her. 
She has some pretty severe depression and while shes on medication for it, there are times that it only helps so much. There have been nights where she has talked about killing herself or starting drugs and I rush to her. When its normal and I leave, she is sad, but tells me its okay. I feel like a dick for taking time for myself and worry because I want her to be okay. I don't know how to convey that I need space for myself without making her think I don't want to spend time with her.      

This leads me to my second problem; I'm leaving for law school in about six months and im very worried about leaving her alone and being unable to be there for her. 

I have tried to bring it up before,  but she threw it back to me and said I was calling her crazy and that I wanted to break up with her. I'm just very scared of her doing something serious to herself when I can't be there for her and I don't want any resentment to come from this. I told her she needs to work on this, but her reasoning is that shes going to be okay the next day so it's okay, I disagree though. She has admitted that she can't be alone which frustrates me even more that she won't try to get help. I don't want to do a long distance relationship only for her to tell me that she needs someone around.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend of one year cannot be alone and I am afraid it will drive us apart. She has severe depression and won't seek help.

POST: Its kinda odd that our relationship has been starting to hit rocky shores because of this topic but it seems very reasonable. My girlfriend and I (both 17) are starting to have relationship problems, as we are starting to fight more, get in more arguments and just frankly not get along too well. 

We've been dating for more than a year and our sex life has been better than excellent. But it's starting to come to the point now that she feels that all I am interested in half the time is just having sex since it is all we do. Whenever were at each others houses we always have sex like its a given as to what we would do that day. She thinks that it's starting to take a toll on our relationship as we can't do anything but have sex like hangout without it. Obviously I love her so very much and don't want our relationship to end but it seems its very close to the finish. 

I really want to change our ways because I do believe half of it is my fault because of how horny I am. (trust me she is also very horny too) I don't know why but it always seems I get too heated in the moment and want to rip my clothes off and have sex with her but I really need to control that now since she sees the negatives of only having sex. we both go to school at the moment so we don't spend that much time together other than school so when we do see each other we are going to have sex. what should I do if I want to try and fix my relationship as its too based on the sex we have? (ofc its not the ONLY thing we do but it is a good portion) I love her and I really want to fix things as I understand how she feels and how she thinks our relationship is too based on sex.

TITLE: TIFU by letting 13 year old girls play with my DJ set before my show.

POST: So I was playing a bar mitzvah, it was actually my first DJ gig as an official DJ, I'd played house parties and stuff but this was my first time getting paid. Anyway, for all the parties I used a pair of computer speakers, Alesis Elevate 3s if you must know, but this was a bigger venue so I decided to use a different setup. 

I used my big huge Klipsch kt-lcr speakers but I couldn't find an amplifier, so I used my AM/FM stereo, a fairly nice one from the 90's, I'd been DJing with this setup in my bedroom for a while and everything worked fine if you kept the bass down a little. 

I got to the party a little bit too early and I was still setting up. The bar mitzvah kid's twin comes up with one of her friends and asks if they can play with my set. It's all setup so I thought ""Eh, what could possibly go wrong"" I delve under the mess of wires and cords to setup a few lights when I smell a plasticy smell and start to see smoke.

The noise starts to spontaneously weird out, the bass cutting in and out, until it just stops altogether. Anyway I come out from under the set and look at my board, the girls had cranked the bass and were scratching. I couldn't really tell about the bass, the speakers were pretty bassy and they were scratching. I shooed them off and thought maybe they were messing with the high-pass. I cue up another song and I hear a groan from my setup and then smell more smoke. I finally see it.

My FM/AM receiver is in flames. I immediately unplug it and start waving away the smoke, the fire has already started to go out. I wait a couple minutes for it to cool then try to play something else, but the lights on the stereo won't even come on. I had to play the rest of the show through the bar mitzvah's crappy bass amp.

Worked my first shift with one of my coworkers a couple months ago and my first reaction was that he is totally my type but I should just get over it because I should be professional. Work a couple more shifts with him and we talk during the breaks about our interests, and he'd always greet me with a smile and ask me about my day. He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.

Then I fucked up and caught feelings. 

Here's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work.

TL;DR:",  I have a gross girly crush on a co-worker but haven't seen him since mid-December and don't know whether to pursue it or not because he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree.,"  shy, awkward 19 year old female too young for office romances. I assume this is how romcom characters in office romances feel."

TITLE: I (21m) seeking advices with (21f) i've been seeing/dating.

POST: so i (21m)'ve been seeing this girl (21f), we went on couple dates and its pretty clear that we like each other, the problem is that after our lunch date today, she drove us back to her college, and about to go to a show with her friend, i was gonna meet up with my mate from the same college, anyway, of the all the recent times we caught up, we either end it with kisses or at least hug, but nope she didnt do either today, the scenario was us two and her friend, i thought she was in a rush so didn't worry about it coz i was planning to see her again after i caught up with my mate. i asked her when does the show finish, she told me its 3hrs ish, i told her i might still be around, told her to text me when it finishes. time forward 3hrs(we actually studied in the 3hrs time), didnt get a reply from her, so i started leaving her college, on the way out, of course she is on her way back, this time with our common friend (20f), so we(3 of us) chatted for a bit(like normal friend convo for couple minutes) it was getting weird, so i was like ok im gonna go now, i was expecting she'd come give me a hug or something but nope again, she's acting like we are normal friends and still havent heard from her....

so what do you guys think? we actually never discussed what we are, but i know for sure she's not that type of girl who wants a fling, she wants something serious. now i think about it, when there are people around us who know her, she wouldn't hold my hand or anything intimate, only when we are alone, she'd let me hold her hands and make out.

How do you deal with kids who won't give you something they're not supposed to have when you ask for it? For example, I'm babysitting my little cousins tonight and I had to yank the remote control out of a 20-month-old's hands. I asked her for the remote (her brother was watching the TV or I wouldn't have cared) and tried to take it from her gently, but I ended up having to yank it away from her with more force than I would have liked to use with someone so little. The resulting tantrum was epic. I didn't like grabbing something from her somewhat harshly and was wondering if there's a better way to go about getting them to drop something they won't return. Or am I just being a sissy?

TITLE: I (M/23) have serious troubles (on my part) communicating and relating to my mother.

POST: I have never really been able to talk to my mom easily. My parents divorced when I was about 3, and I have always been a bit of a troublesome and angry kid (and now adult). She is way more extroverted than I am and talks far more than I do. She has always been understanding, helpful, and supportive of whatever I do (despite being quite controlling of my life), but for some fucked up reason I resent her. Whenever her and I are alone I feel agitated, frustrated, and annoyed, so I just can't have a proper conversation without getting sarcastic and snippy, and shooting down what she says.

I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me, and it has been eating me up for my whole life and I don't know how to fix it. It feels like there is a mental block in my mind that prevents me from having a positive relationship with her, and I feel like I need some sort of therapy to fix it. She has been nothing but tolerant of me my entire life, despite me being a shithead most of the time.

The thing is I want to be able to relate to her, and I know that's all she wants, but my mind will absolutely not let me do it. Whenever I'm by myself I hate myself for being such a bad son. Has anybody had any experience with this, or have any advice about it? Thanks.

TITLE: TIFU by falling asleep in my bros bed

POST: Alright, so this happened two days ago, on saturday afternoon. To set the scene, I go to a pretty large school in the south and the weekends pretty consist of drinking a lot and socializing. I got to the house where a few of my bros live at around 4 and to kill the time we decided to through a movie on and chill until it was time to start drinking and go out. HBO recently started carrying Bulletproof Monk so we throw that on. Turns out its fucking awful. I end up falling asleep on the end of his bed laying ~~horizontally~~ like a dog.

     Falling asleep was the beginning of my fuck up. I briefly remember a nightmare of being chased by some hellacious creature, I turn back to look at it while running, but cannot find it. I look forward. BANG I hit something.

     So I come to stumbling up the stairs of my bud's house with a massive headache, not knowing what the fuck has happened to me. I  rub my head (much to my chagrin it feels like its been beaten worse Denver in the super bowl last year) and find my hand covered in blood. I basically fall into the living room where all my friends are drinking and ask what the hell is going on and what happened. I simply can't talk and am concussed as fuck. I walk into the bathroom to find a major gash at the top of my head and blood all down my face. The next thirty minutes is comprised of me being in complete shock, not knowing where I am, and wondering what happened to me. I finally gather myself and start cutting up with my friends. This is when the guy who's room I fell asleep in walks through the front door holding a golf club... Not pointing fingers, but seriously, i'm suspicious now. 

**TIFU** by falling asleep on a bed doggy style, having my best friend hit me in the head with his golf club and being majorly concussed.

Passionate make out sessions, heavy petting, etc. Now as things got pretty intense I see the definite signs of arousal, erect nipples, heavy breathing, dilated pupils, and she seems to be getting a little wet under her jeans.

 We break from anything more serious because time has become a factor but we just talk about what we enjoyed i learn some things about what turned her on but then she drops that she has considered herself asexual, but based on what both of us have seen that night she's in an interesting place.

To me she was clearly aroused and might have proceeded further, and she's not too sure what happened either as it's not how things usually are for her. I'm giving her time to think about everything and don't plan on pressuring her one way or another. I care about her enough to be fine with her if she feels like having sex with me or not.

TITLE: Can we have a ""Post Your Dress"" thread?

POST: Hello /r/weddingplanning!

I am very new to this sub and I am obsessed! I'm not engaged yet myself but SO and I have talked a lot about it and it is in our near future for sure :) ANYWAYS. I'm specifically fascinated by all the wedding dress photos that people have been posting. One thing that I find myself constantly wondering as someone who will be shopping for one is 'WOW, how much does that beautiful thing cost??' **So I'm wondering if y'all would be ever so kind as to post photos of you wearing your dress as well as including the following info: dress name, cost, place of purchase, size?, and any other info you'd like to include regarding the dress.** I think this will be great to see all the posts in one place (and feed my new wedding planning obsession) :)

I realize that there are already subs dedicated to wedding dresses but they are so small. So I'm posting here in the hopes that we can get many people posting their dresses and then we can all gush over them in one place. 

And a side note on future individual dress posts:
Is anyone interested in making a 'requirement' that dress posts include 'stats' in the post title? Similar to how /r/progresspics requires body stats so we understand the context. This would include things that I mentioned above like dress name, price, place of purchase, etc. Can even include dress size for more context (unless poster is uncomfortable sharing that info). What do you think?

TITLE: Why don't self posts get karma?

POST: I understand that they used to and that people [complained] because there were lots of ""vote up if"" type posts that were getting karma. Removing karma from them, however, does not appear to have changed things. They've always been reported and deleted (none are on in the pages [archived by archive.org] for the time before it was removed). They still show up from time to time (despite it actually saying right above where I'm typing this ""*Beginning your title with ""vote up if"" is violation of intergalactic law.*""), then they get reported and removed.

However, one effect that this has influenced is the creation of rage comics and an increase in screenshots. I've even noticed that increase just over the last year. Now, I'm not saying that they wouldn't happen if self posts got karma, nor that they are always inappropriate, but it is evident that there are some things that would be better as self posts that are instead posted as screen shots or rage comics and it's hard to not think that the lack of karma for self posts plays a part in this.

So, I think we should revisit this decision. It seems to me that self posts add original content to reddit and should be encouraged. This very, and very popular, subreddit is a perfect example. It accepts nothing *but* self posts. [IAmA] is another perfect example of a popular subreddit that is affected by this that is also quite popular. So, is there any reason we shouldn't start letting self posts get karma? If there is not, what kind of karma would be the most appropriate for them?

TITLE: Girlfriend has never instigated sex.  Not once.   Advice from women pleeeasseee.

POST: I am 21 and she is 20, we have been dating for about 19months.  

This being said, we are a very sexually active couple, being a 21-year old male, I have the sex-drive of a 21-year old male.   Because of this I know she is completely comfortable with sex, never once has she denied it and she is always into it, but not even once in almost *two years* has she instigated it.  I have brought it up to her so many times and everytime she just says sorry, but then it's instantly forgotten about and *nothing* changes.

I can't figure out what to do because theres clearly not much I can do to fix it if telling her about how much it bothers me has never changed anything in the long course of time that she has known its bothered me.

If you are wondering why it bothers me it is quite simple: I see sex, when in a relationship, as a very important thing and as the most explicit way to show someone you care about them if you're willing to let them see you completely naked and you will please them.  Therefore I get greatly bothered by her never putting even an ounce of effort in to starting it off, not even making out.  I have *every single time* for almost 2 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [24F] for ten years broke-up six months ago; now I feel angry to myself and can't talk to people

POST: Hi.

When I was in fifth grade, at 2005, a beautiful girl asked me to be her friend; and we were together until six months ago, that's around 9-10 years. I can't remember the times I wasn't with her. I don't have a memory which doesn't include her.

I was never comfortable around people, and only with her I was relaxed, I could talk comfortably only with her, and we always said that we won't leave each ever. I was very happy.

And things start to get bad. I couldn't met her expectations. She got depressed, and I couldn't help her; I couldn't find correct words to say to her, and I couldn't make her happy. After the treatment for her depression, she (correctly) left me, and blocked me everywhere except one messaging service.

After that, I was just making myself believe that she'll be back, we'll be together and happy again. But she clearly isn't. Recently she told me that she's with someone else, he loves her very much etc. 

And there's me now. My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.

She isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.

Actually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.

Have a nice day everyone.

TITLE: Redditors, have you ever thought of a genius invention on your own, that later in life you found out made someone else rich?

POST: Hi reddit, I'm 19 and I currently go to Virginia Tech University in the U.S. Ever since I was little i would always come up with inventions in my mind that I didn't have the ability to make myself and would never share for no particular reason with people that could. One that I remember, that recently I found out had been invented was a machine that would tell people how many parking spaces were available and where those parking spaces were in a parking garage. I'd always hate going to the mall with my family and being stuck searching floor after floor of the garage for a spot, and thought that what if someone could create a small sensor like an invisible laser that you could install over every parking space to signal whether a car was under it or not, if the space was free it would light up and direct cars to it. This was 5 or 6 years ago when I was in middle school. The first time i saw one of those boards that tell you if a garage was full I thought to myself, wow that could've been my idea that got me rich, if only I capatilized on the thought. Yesterday as I was parking my car I noticed green lights over spaces that were free and red lights over spaces that weren't...someone had invented what I thought of years ago and put it into reality.

I like my new job, it's with a respected firm led by a well-regarded local professor . . . but it's been three weeks and I still don't have a hiring contract to sign. I'm not sure what to do. He asked for all other hiring documentation (I9s, proof of insurance, voided check, etc.) but hasn't gotten a proper hiring contract for me to sign. He's been ""editing it"" since last week. I wrote to him in an informal email that the end of the week (today) is my personal deadline to complete paperwork, and it's almost 11 (Half day) and I don't have anything. I'm confused and hurt - this is not how you treat people, especially build trust with new employees. He's really well-respected, and this could be a lucrative post-graduate career should I stay, but how can I (and him) respect myself if I do without a contract for much longer? 

I plan to send an email saying that I've enjoyed the work thus far and am available next week as planned pending the receipt of a contract to sign, etc. Is this too demanding for a newbie? Am I a pushover?

She's ok with hanging out-and I dont think I'm in the friend-zone because she's so open to go out. But she just posted a relationship update to make it ""Facebook"" official. What would be a good plan? We're getting together in a little over a month to shop around at a record store, a hippie shop, etc. I just feel like even though I don't know her that well it was like a spiritual and emotional connection. But she's in a relationship which I assume is serious. Should I assert my feelings for her when we meet up? I'm not sure what to do-in my mind she's life partner/wife material because she seems perfect for me. At this point in y life I really don't want a girlfriend or children but she makes me think otherwise.

TITLE: Reddit, who is the most important person in your life, and why?

POST: Mine is simple, my kids. I will always remember the one day my daughter made me feel like the best dad in the world. I sometimes have to go back to work late at night to attend meetings (I work for a place with offices around the world) and one day I was home before my family was done with school. I decided to make some dinner and leave it for them and while I was making it I spotted some cookie dough in the fridge. I thought it would be nice to leave them cookies. So when my wife picks the kids up from daycare she said my daughter seemed to have a rough day (as rough as a 5 year old can have, I guess) and was very grumpy/sad. When they got home my son smelled the curry I had made and got very excited and then my daughter found the cookies. I had left a little note saying to enjoy the cookies and sorry for having to work late. My daughter started to cry and said she was so happy. My wife took a short video and sent it to me at work. I have never felt more needed and counted upon, then that. I know that these kids will cause me all kinds of worry throughout our lives, but I wouldn't trade that feeling of unconditional love for anything.

TITLE: My disabled little sister is getting bullied. What advice can I give her?

POST: My little sister is 14 years old and has cerebral palsy. She is functionally fine except for her legs. She's been in a wheel chair most of her life but can walk, albeit not very far, with a frame. My mum is quite overprotective of her and she doesn't go out of the house except for school and the times I take her to the movies or whatnot. 

Her only real friend is a kid named Jordan who she only knows because he is the kid of one of my mums friends. He's a few years younger than her and they don't go to the same school.

I live with my girlfriend and don't see my sister as much as I once did but when I went to visit last weekend she told me she was getting bullied at school. Apparently a lot of the kids have taken to calling her a lesbian and this is upsetting her quite a bit. I asked my mum about it and she said it's been going on for awhile and she's spoken to her teachers about it. But this doesn't seem to have done anything.

We didn't actually discuss whether she was a lesbian or not, apart from the fact that that is just not a conversation I want to have with ANY person that is 11 years my junior, especially not my baby sister it's just not something that really concerns either of us. We've talked about being gay in the past, as our next door neighbors are a gay couple that come over just about every other day, and she is very much of the opinion that it just doesn't matter who you love, as long you're happy.

There wasn't really a lot of advice I could give her outside of ""aim for the throat"". I too was bullied at school and eventually it stopped because I started to pummel the people doing it, but as you can imagine that's not really something I can tell my sister to do, even if she was actually capable of doing it.

So basically has anyone got any advice I can give to her?

POST: So this girl I know was in a picture with me in one of those poses, you know, where one of you is holding the camera at arms length? It got posted on facebook, real cute. Anyway, another guy we both know who is younger than us by 4 years has a massive crush on her. He spends way more time with her than I do, because I work a lot, and it's pretty obvious to everyone.

Thing is, though, this girl is real flirty to other guys, particularly me, partly because I'm the next-most present person, but also because I'm just swell. He doesn't like it. And as the immature bozo he is, he takes potshots at me occasionally (in words of course) especially when the flirting is afoot. Now, I'm not one to bother getting into it with him (he's like 6'5'') because that will surely get me nowhere.

That was my position on it UNTIL he commented on the photo. In it, we happen to be dressed as avatars for a halloween party, and it just so happens that I have reddish long hair so I just braided it rather than get a black wig. I commented in the pic that I look crazy. Well this wise guy, who was also at the party as an avatar painted blue, decides to comment on it with, ""you're covered in blue makeup and have your hair braided like a kindergarten school girl... I think your crazy is more internal than aesthetic.""

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I thought he was a friendly dude I'd laugh it off, agree and all. But no. Now it's posted on facebook for the internets to see it. LAME NO THX. So I feel the need to post a snappy but subtle comeback. AND YOU CAN HELP!

TITLE: TIFU by having a shitty morning and going to McDonald's

POST: About two days ago actually I had a really shitty morning.

Firstly my alarm does not go off. So I didn't have breakfast. Rush to the train station and I miss my train by 15 seconds.

So, minding my own business as I finally make it to my campus I decide to hit up McDonald's (their hash browns are really nice in Australia).
So as I'm walking down campus to get breakfast I hear a whirling sound. Wheels. Roller blades?

I turn my head around and for about half a second I spot a little girl maybe 4 or 5 years old on a scooter. Then suddenly everything stops and I hear a sickening bang. I didn't feel anything so I thought I imagined it but sure enough she had fallen over, her little razor scooter tipped over with her.

I freak out and ask her if she's okay, if she's bleeding, if her parents are nearby. On the inside I was swearing like a sailor.

Luckily her dad was not too far behind, along with the girl's little sister. She wasn't hurt, there was no bleeding and by the end of it they're all consoling me instead.

TL;DR:","  Had a shitty morning, went to McDonald's to get breakfast, heard a little girl on a scooter fall over, everyone rushed to help, no injury, everyone consoled me instead.",  I thought I nearly killed someone because I was walking along minding my own business before they collided with me.

TITLE: [28/F] Trying to be classy. And date several guys at once.

POST: I recently got out of a long term relationship and am sick of being a serial monogamist. My goal for right now is to go out on actual dates (dinner, drinks, coffee) with different men, and go out on several dates and get to know them as people, and then selectively get physical with them if it feels right. Its working pretty well: I've made it clear to them that I am in no way ready for a commitment and they've each acknowledged that.

Except I finally slept with one. And he's very into me. And texts me all the time. I hate texting in general and frequently don't return texts.  (I have told him that I suck at texting but still texts me all the time). Now I'm feeling like I'm going to break his heart, even though expectations were on the table. 

Do I (1) need an attitude adjustment because I've been clear about my expectations with each person or (2) am I playing with fire and potentially being irresponsible by engaging with people in a romantic context and then only responding to their texts/calls when it suits me? (I'm also a genuinely busy person).

I am open to general advice as well on actual dating and balancing sex and communication. (The only person I know who went on a lot of actual dates is my very old/old fashioned grandmother, and she definitely could not relate to a Tinder world.)

TITLE: I just noticed I don't have full access to my boyfriend's facebook profile. Should I be concerned?

POST: I'm pretty sure this is a stupid thing to be concerned about in the grand scheme of things, but I could use some input.

I was looking for one of his friends who got married recently (couldn't remember her amended last name, but I knew they were facebook friends) so I went to his profile to check his friends and locate her. But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. 

Now, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them. 

The thing is, I don't think I'm an overly clingy girlfriend (and he has said numerous times that I'm not). I don't try to control every aspect of his life. So I'm not sure why I no longer have full access. 

I'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.

Is it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide? I'm not going to fly off the handle; it's just that his track record has been such that this could be nothing, or it could be SUPER HUGE, and I won't know until it's too late.

TITLE: TIFU by taking my ex out for dinner

POST: Ok. So like many posts this FU was not today, but back in December. 

BACKSTORY: I had dated this girl freshman year of Highschool. Things were good, but I broke up with her out of peer pressure. I was a self conscious Freshman with little self esteem. I regretted it for years, and the fact we ended up being FWB a couple times did not help. 

So we both get through our first semester of college, myself at a school in Tx, her in Ok. Didn't see each other often, but we did snapchat back and forth once and a while. Well over break she says she is tired of being single, her ex was shitty, blah blah blah. I offer to take her out.

We both dress up, and I took her to this little seafood restaurant, and go see a movie after. The movie I wanted to see so that wasn't really a problem. But I paid for all of it. Every dime.

Throughout the course of the evening all the repressed feelings I had resurfaced, we kissed, it was a bomb time. 

At the end she asks me to drive her to her ex's place. Are you kidding me?!? Which then she calls me right after break to tell me she's dating him again. 

So cool, now I have this slight feeling of desire, mixed with the burning hatred from being screwed.

TL;DR:","  Took ex out for dinner, things were going great, turns out she's dating her ex again. Feelings resurfaced, burning hatred mixed with desire.","  took an ex out to dinner, brought up old feelings, got played, now I want to hate her with the fire of 1000 burning suns but still can't completely despise her."

POST: A girl that I've known for a few years and I began hooking up recently. I'm extremely attracted to her; we have tons in common and just generally get on great and have become very close. However, the kissing is just..awkward. 

We both have different styles and both want to seem to lead. We acknowledged it and tried to work on it. I kissed her my way and she tried to follow suit but we just weren't synching up and couldn't get into a rhythm. She got paranoid then and wouldn't kiss me the way she usually goes about it.

She's pretty much conceded that it's a deal breaker and that we just don't have sexual chemistry. I'm not so sure. Yes, it was awkward but I wanted to work on it and hopefully we'd eventually get there, and I was still turned on during it.

Everything else is perfect apart from this one thing.  I really thought I might have something with this girl.  It's something that's never ever happened either of us before.. kissing just comes naturally right? Or at least you usually adjust to what's happening. Maybe we put too much pressure on fixing it?

POST: So this girl and I have been in a pretty serious relationship for the past 5ish months. She is a little older and has a 5 year old girl from a past relationship that I have just fallen in love with. I have always wanted kids and this has given me a taste of what it is like to be a Daddy.

We both love each other very much and the kid and I both love each other as well. I have taken the little girl fishing, to the zoo, on walks with the dog, etc.

My SO and I have lived together about two months and it has been a little rocky because of our situation but in terms of the relationship between us it has been great.

We met each other in detox and I went to rehab for a few months. We talked while I was there and when I got home we got together.

Not too long after we started getting serious and I started getting involved with the kid she started asking a lot of questions about my ex because of things she saw on Facebook. She believes that my ex is still in love with me and that since we were together so long and still has a lot of pictures up of us together, of which I was also guilty. She asked about a couple casual conversations that my ex and I had in the last few months and I told her honestly that it was just casual conversation.

She seems to think the contrary and believes that it is only a matter of time before we end up getting back together. I tell her there is no way in hell I would do that regardless of being in a relationship or not but she is persistent.

She is so afraid I am going to break her and her daughter's hearts.

I don't know what else to say to her at this point. I deleted all our photos, unfriended her, told her to please take hers down.

TITLE: Me [43 M] with my new partner [37F] 3 weeks duration, first time trying to be intimate I had a failure to launch due to psychological block.

POST: So here is my issue. First some background, I am fairly recently divorced (1 year) coming out of a really bad marriage of 15 years. It was a bad breakup with lots of bitterness on both sides, add to that 2 kids who I now don't get to see as often as I would like. I went from that right into a horrible abusive relationship with a much younger woman (24 F) who essentially saw I was incredibly vulnerable and used me for financial gain while filling my head with how I was a really terrible person which is why I ended up divorced and that she didn't know why she stayed with me. The end result was any self esteem I had was ruined but I somehow got addicted to her. 

I finally left that relationship 3 months ago after I just couldn't take it anymore. I really worked to try and improve myself and have lost a bunch of weight and my general outlook on life has improved. I met a really nice woman a couple of weeks ago and we clicked. I really like her, she likes me and hey things seem to be looking up. 

So the problem, we decided to become intimate and things seemed to be going good but I couldn't get hard. I was into it, wanted it but it just wasn't happening. First time ever for me that this occurred. I have no problem getting an erection if I masturbate so it's not physical but psychological. I still have in my head the crap my ex gf used to tell me plus I guess lingering guilt over my divorce. So how do I overcome this, because I really want to develop this into a healthy relationship.

POST: As the new admin of IT at my library, I inspire confidence in all the employees just by being here while they work on their computers. When anything electronic needs any kind of maintenance, repair, instillation, etc. *I ride down from Mt. Olympus and activate my powers of computing to quicken all the digital world.*

The only problem is that **I am shit with computers.** I have no idea how I got this job because most of you reading this probably know better how to use them than I do. I broke explorer by trying to install an update. *I'm that bad at it.* 

But I fumble through this and everyone cheers! ""Great job, Crazybay. You are vital to our staff, CrazyBay."" ""Do you want another raise? No? How about we just buy you subway once a week, put you on salary, and pay your cell phone and internet bills?""

I recently screwed up one of my bosses computers pretty bad (it may have not actually been my fault but probably was). After a full weekend of stress and reading dozens of pages of stuff on support.microsoft.com, I not only unbroke it, but I also installed the ghetto new circulation system on her office computer!!

This shouldn't matter as much as it does to me but now I feel just the slightest bit validated in receiving the beef-up paycheck that came with the job.

TITLE: Me [44 F] with my friend [44 F] 32 years, I lied to her 25 years ago and having anxiety about it now.

POST: She and I have been best friends since we were children and have been through a ton of shit together and are still best friends to this day. 

She liked a guy when we were 19 years old and they had slept together a couple of times.  He didn't want a relationship but she did, so she ended it but still had feelings for him.

I do not remember the time in between but he came on to me and I slept with him.  She had moved away by this time. Word traveled fast and she found out and confronted me on the phone.  She asked if it was just once and I said yes.  She asked if I was drunk and I said yes.  Both are not true.  It was twice and I wasn't drunk.  No excuses.  I broke the girl code.  I was so afraid of losing her that I thought this way she would know kind of what happened and I had a better chance of retaining the friendship.  I am honest when I say there was no maliciousness involved in not telling her.  Truth is, I was and may still be a coward. Come to find out years later I trickle truthed her. 

I have generalized anxiety.  For whatever reason lately, this incident is first and foremost in my head when the anxiety hits.  I keep thinking I should tell her but it may just be to assuage my own guilt and a way to reduce the emotional pain.  I have spoken to my psychologist about this and he said that it was so long ago and she knows the act that happened that there is no need to hurt her again unnecessarily.  He seems to think that my anxiety is looking for an outlet and has latched on to this event.  I honestly hadn't thought of the event in years.  So much has happened in both our lives (marriages, children, etc) that it seems like ancient history. I don't know what to do and would appreciate some outside perspective.  Thank you.

POST: To keep things short and sweet, we live about 2 hours from each other and today was our 1 year anniversary. I took off as did he and I made the trip last night to go visit him so we could celebrate our 1 year together. Today however, we did nothing but look for clothes for his new job as a server.

We woke up early and tried to make things snappy, as 4PM rolls around we're finally wrapping things up but we're both frustrated because we wanted to have a day together to do 1 year anniversary things (go to museums, get food, go see a movie). Due to it being such an ordeal going from shop to shop, mall to mall that by the end of it we didn't have time to do any of it because everything would be closed after we battled through city 5o'clock traffic. He had a melt-down because I wanted to go back home and sleep in my own bed because I was exhausted and I didn't see a point in staying if he had to work at 7AM the next day.

My question to you, reddit; Am I totally out of line for being upset that he didn't really take care of his commitments before hand or am I just a needy little bitch? Please help me understand his side because I so badly want to get over this but I just cant understand his train of thought when I stopped my multiple projects a day early so I could come on Wednesday night and not Thursday morning.

TITLE: 18 year old guy, first relationship. Please help.

POST: We split up in the middle of the summer because she was leaving for the semester, and she wasn't into me anymore (or so she claimed). We got back together at the end of the summer temporarily when our families stayed at the same hotel for a week during vacation.

She left for the semester, started hooking up with a douche who eventually cheated on her and got expelled. I made a terrible decision and hooked up with one of her friends and had a brief fling with another one. I was incredibly depressed and looking for someone to cling to for support. She had a brief fling with another guy and is currently pursuing a third. We talk a lot over email and chat, although it's mostly me who initiates contact. Towards the beginning of the semester I asked several times if she wanted to get back together and she said it was too early to tell. The last time, I pressed her for an answer (was a month or two ago), and she rejected me pretty brutally.

She came back for thanksgiving break and didn't particularly want to see me, although she wasn't totally opposed to it. She went to a random party and hooked up with several guys but apparently they weren't particularly desirable. She posted a bunch of shit on her tumblr about lost love and missing someone. She could mean me, or could mean the guy she's currently pursuing. I have no idea. She posted a picture with the caption: ""You used to be alright. What happened?"" and said ""[name], lovie, this is for you.""

Those are the facts and I have no idea what to make of them. I think she still has feelings for me, but is also angry/disgusted with my hooking up with her friends. I've apologized and explained myself to her, and I don't know how best to help the situation now.

I would really like to get back with her when she gets back, but I don't know if that's possible or how best to go about doing that. My idea was to give her some space for a month (aka no contact) and seeing how she feels when she gets back. Am I an idiot? What should I be doing? I have no idea what to do. Please please help.

TITLE: I [17f] cannot figure if crush [19m] is interested in me or just bored. How can I ask?

POST: So I've been chatting on fb almost weekly for substantial periods of time (20 min - 1 hr) with a boy who graduated from my school last year for almost a year now and I can't tell if he actually enjoys our conversations or feels obligated to respond and wishes I would leave him alone. I've been able to see him in person a couple of times since he left for college (once when I visited his city and asked and once when he came back and said he'd try to see me, which he did.) over Christmas break I tried to see him and he was busy (legitimately so, I believe, but there was no mention of trying another time) and when I messaged him he took much longer than usual to reply so I decided not to try contacting him in case he was trying to get rid of me (I almost always start the conversation.) A little over two weeks later, he messaged me and we talked for about an hour. I messaged him about a week after to say our school had posted a baby photo of him (he's the son of two teachers, that's why it was posted) and we talked for a while. There wasn't a clear ending to the conversation as we seemed to miss when the other was online but we were having a good conversation when he just stopped responding. It's been three days and he hasn't even read the message. 

I can't figure out what's going on here. Does he actually want to be friends or does he just like talking to me when he's bored or am
I the annoying girl who can't take a hint? Can I ask about it? I'm worried to say anything because it'll probably come off as needy (and maybe it is) and I'll look extremely insecure but at the same time I'm tired of constantly wondering about this. I hate that I get worked up waiting for him to reply and I'd just like to know what he's thinking so I know if it's even worth it to continue making an effort to be friends. 

What should I do? Is there any eloquent way to approach this or should I just let it be?

TITLE: F/20 Should I be worried about our future together?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for six months and we're planning on living together this coming fall. He and I won't see each other during the summer months since we'll be in different states working, and we'll move in together right when he gets back. I am one hundred percent ready to make this leap with him, but what makes me hesitate is that he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves, and that he feels more fulfilled when he is alone because he is more productive. This brought on the topic that he thinks that living together like this will either solidify our relationship or end it. I think it's a bit strange to bring this up while still planning on moving in together... Our relationship has been a bit rocky because of the lack of productivity together. When we're together, we just want to BE together: not be bothered by friends, school, etc. Just be in each others company. This has made both of our grades suffer, and friendships. Which has soured the relationship. We both said that when we look back on our history together, it's been great but not as great as it could be because of how little we have actually done. I am just worried that this isn't the right step to take in our relationship if he feels so rocky about it, and if our relationship is based off of a history of non-productivity. 
Have any of you been in this situation? And what did you do to fix it? Or can it be fixed?

POST: Hi /relationships, this is my first post. I read the rules, but please let me know if I missed anything :)

So I've been dating this wonderful girl for about a year and a half now. She absolutely adores me, would do anything for me, and I would do the same for her. We're both college grads and live near each other in a bigger city. 

But as much as I enjoy our relationship and feel devoted to her, when I look to future I can't see us together. Whenever I think about moving in together, or even getting engaged, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't picture marrying her. I can't picture marrying anyone right now.

I think what we have is just a ""comfortable"" relationship. But when do I need to either commit to the next step or break it off? She was looking at apartments online the other day and started using words like ""we"" when describing moving into them. We had a talk about how I wasn't ready for anything a few months ago and she seemed to be on the same page, but lately she's been hinting at the long-term kind of things, and says her family is asking her about me and our plans as well.

TITLE: TIFU by calling out a line cutter

POST: I was at a grocery store last night, picking some stuff up for a date, and I got in line at the express counter, but a man came over and stood in front of me. At first I thought I'd let it go, but then decided to say something, so I said something alone the lines of ""hey, um, sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I was standing right there when you came over and got in line . . .""

And he let me go in front of him, at first apologizing but then said ""it's not a big deal, you don't have to have a cow about it.""

First of all, WTF is this, 1998? Second, I wasn't having a cow, I was trying to be as polite as possible in letting him know he'd cut me in line. So now I am a little agitated, and said ""well you don't just cut people in line!"" and we got into an argument about whether he knew what he was doing. He said ""fuuuuck yoouuu"" and I said ""fuck you too,"" and he flew off the handle, started calling me a bitch over and over as I was paying for my stuff. It was really, really terrible and I was badly shaken by the end of it.

I know I wasn't nice, it was a bad idea to engage after he made that ""have a cow"" comment, should've given him the benefit of the doubt when he said he didn't see me, and I really didn't need to return the f-bomb he hurled at me. Should've just let it go.

TITLE: My boyfriend [18M] is very angry at me [18F] because I don't like jewelry.

POST: We have been together over two years, but got in a very large fight today. We have large fights occasionally where my boyfriend just gets blinded by his anger. 

I have never ever liked jewelry, and haven't worn a single item of jewelry since elementary school, my ears aren't even pierced. Even with this fact, my boyfriend continues to buy me jewelry.

I haven't been rude about it up until this point, because you shouldn't ever really refuse a gift. But I do make a point to him that I don't like jewelry, and never wear it, while trying to be as polite as possible. For some reason, he can't understand this about me and continues to get angry that he buys me jewelry I don't wear, etc. etc. He just seems to not understand I don't want this type of typically ""nice"" gift. I still thank him for the original intent, but at what point should he start treating me as a person with individual likes and dislikes? He just expects me to like typical ""girl""  things. He's very upset with me and calling me ungrateful. Sigh. Maybe he's right. It's just something I will never be able to like but am expected to be grateful for anyway :/ 

Also, I would understand if we just started dating, but it's been two and a half years of this. I don't want to lie to him about my interests though.

He is also trying to break up with me right now....but he does that every time he gets angry.

POST: I've happened to see/read a lot about hypnotists being able to ""instruct"" people to do things while in some form of a hypnotic state (like the classic sleeper agent spy who will perform an act when his hypnotic state is activated). There have been plenty of movies and entertainment TV shows that showcase this, including one I saw a while back that purported to show that it was possible and effected. There's also the use of hypnosis as for drug/alcohol/mental status therapy that has plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this.

However my question revolves around whether students could be hypnotized and taught material as is in a normal class and usefully retain that information when not in a hypnotic state? I'm a college student and (no surprise here) the idea occurred to me while cramming for an exam.

POST: A little background.  We have been dating for almost 9 months and have had ups and downs with stresses of attending school and both doing hard science majors.  

Basically she claims that I only do nice things for her when something is going wrong and that when she does nice things (like a small note) I don't say anything.  We have had arguments of this before and it had seemingly been resolved.

Now that it is the summer and she is back home with her family about 5 hours away from me.  I visited about 3 weeks ago and we had an amazing time.  We both wish we could have spent the whole summer together.  

Last week she was agitated with her family, specifically her dad and brothers and I had spent a lot of time talking to her about her frustration.  She said she did not feel like she was loved enough.  So for the last week or so I have been trying to do nice things for her here and there because of this (like sending a handwritten card, and flowers).  As this has been happening she seems to be getting more distant with me.  I try and get at what is really bothering her and she is does not give me a straightforward answer.

Just continues to say all of these extremely hurtful things to me.  I didn't try and reason with her much, just told her that whether you ever believe me or not I care for you deeply (and things along those lines).

It seems like she is taking all of her anger out on me from other things going on in her life and I do not understand how to respond.  Should I try and talk to her or just leave her alone for while?  I am at a loss of what to do because it seems like it is coming out of nowhere.

I seen this guy about 1-3 times a week for the past 5 months and we communicate every single day. Last week I started getting weird vibes from him (he doesn't cuddle with me as much and looks at his phone more). After I left his apartment, he hasn't tried to initiate any conversation for about 5 days. His birthday was coming up and he was inviting his friends to hang out (both female and male) and did not invite me. I messaged him the day of his birthday  to congratulate and asked if he was doing anything. He explained again he's going to hang out with his friends, but made no mentioning that he wanted me there. He also later in the night hung out with coworkers as well to celebrate.

In the past I've planned things for us and asked myself to hang out with him but generally if he's already out with people and I ask to join,  he has a reason I shouldn't be there. He takes a lot of initiate so I think he just didn't want me there at his birthday.

I feel like if I express my feelings I will seem needy. He's not my boyfriend. I feel like I don't seem important enough in his life to want me there to celebrate for him.

I would like to continue to be his friend, but how do I express that I get the sense he doesn't like me as much anymore and it's better to end it now and the lack of invitation was a sign he didn't want me there?

TL;DR:",  guy I'm seeing didn't invite me to his birthday party and it seems like he doesn't want me there anymore. How do I express my feelings and end things now without seeming needy?,  guy of 5 months didn't invite me to meet him and his friends on his birthday. What's the best way of ending this?

TITLE: Getting mixed signals from a girl I'm interested in [21/m][25/f]

POST: I went out to a bar last night with a coworker, her boyfriend, and her cousin. The night started off okay, me and the cousin where chatting and getting along pretty well. Then her 'ex' (they talked for a while but he told her he wasn't looking for anything serious) showed up and they spent a while talking to each other. He eventually left and I ignored her for a while (I mean c'mon she shunned me for an ex). Next thing I know she grabs my hand and we are alone outside the bar making out (I assumed it was a ""I hate me ex I'll just make out with you"" type thing, but she is cute and I had a few drinks in me so I went with it).

After the kissing ended I mentioned her ex and she apologized profusely and said she had no idea he was going to be there and she just isn't sure how to act around him yet. She said it's totally over between them. We talk about how we both are looking for a real relationship and we are definitely interested in getting to know each other more. We exchange numbers and make plans to see each other today, but nothing was set in concrete. My coworker asks me today what I thought of her, I said she's pretty cool and ask if she said anything about me, apparently ""i'm a good kisser"". 

So I call her this afternoon and ask about a time to hang out, she says she is going to lunch with a friend and will get in touch afterwards and let me know a good time (I was at work till later the evening anyway). She then texts me a few hours later saying she forgot she had plans with a friend and she is free tomorrow if we want to get together then. Now I have become pretty jaded with dating and the opposite sex in general, so I immediately doubted her ""prior plans"". Not too mention I'm not the most confident person in the world so I immediately assume that she's blowing me off. 

Am I over thinking things? Do I have legitimate concerns? I'm definitely interested in this girl and I want things to work, but I don't want to waste my time either.

TL;DR:","  Interested in a girl, she said she has plans with someone else tomorrow and is free tomorrow if we want to hang out, I'm pretty jaded with dating and the opposite sex in general.

TITLE: I (24, female) found out that my boyfriend (23, male) responded to a male seeking male casual encounters ad on Craigslist while out of town. Advice needed!

POST: Background info: He and I have been dating for a little over 6 months. Basically fell head over heels, and moved in quickly together. We had plans to move to a new city in August where I will be starting my first year in law school. We have an apartment reserved and everything is taken care of. I have never had any suspicions and he treats me better than anyone I've ever been with. He makes me feel beautiful and worthy of companionship. 

A couple of weeks ago he was sent out of state on a short 5 day business trip. He works for a retail company and was helping to set up a new store. 

Since his return, he's just been a little off. I felt horrible (and still do) but I did something shitty and went through his phone. 

Found out he had responded to a man looking for man casual encounters ad on craigslist. His email sounded very comfortable, as he knew the acronyms and typical format. He sent it the day he got out of town. The man responded 3 days later, to which my boyfriend offered to host. There is no other communication that I could find.

When I confronted him, he said that he has no idea why he even responded to the ad. He said he didn't want to actually meet up, but had the urge to talk to someone online only. He claims that what I have read is the only communication he had and that he has never physically cheated on me. He also said that this is the only instance where he was interested in talking to a man sexually. 

I have no idea what to do. I love and care about him deeply and I have never connected so easily with anyone. I do not know what to believe and whether what he is saying is bullshit.

POST: I suffer from an anxiety disorder, which has recently gotten much worse with both of our college graduations coming up, my classes being very work heavy and fear that I might be doing poorly at work. Because of this, I burst into tears when he is unable to become erect (which used to only happen rarely when he was too tired but now it happens every time). He told me he becomes incredibly anxious when we are about to become intimate because he really wants to perform well and he really really does not want to make me cry but this makes it impossible for him to become erect, then I cry... 

Yes, I have really tried very hard to be supportive and pretend like it doesn't bother me but that is really difficult (and frankly, I am a terrible liar). Especially when he can hear me sobbing in the other room afterwards. I cannot stop it from happening! I try to hide the crying from him but I know he knows, and that makes him anxious which makes him unable to perform next time.

How can we stop this positive feedback loop and have stress free, enjoyable sex again?

TITLE: 22 and whining about parents... (ranting ahead)

POST: I spent four years living half a country away from my parents, and those four years were great, but expensive. So when my parents moved closer to me, I moved in with them, looking to save money and finish school. 

It's been going pretty well. I go to church with them once a week (they're fundamentalist Christians), I don't drink or go to parties and I work to pay for school. They cover my room and board, and occasionally drive me around. 

Last week however, I had a friend come up from Toronto, (about an hour and a half away.) I went to a movie with said friend (Magic Mike) and told my parents I was going to see Abe Lincoln. Ignoring the fact that it's not as terrible as it sounds, that I'm 22 and lying to my parents, my mother somehow found out. 

Now she's all cold and ""I'm too angry, we'll talk about it later"" and I want to be like ""no! We're not going to talk about it later. We're not going to talk about it ever, because it's none of your business."" I appreciate what they've done for me, and they've been a huge help, especially in the last few months, but sometimes I want to tell them that parts of my life have nothing to do with them. 

I'm tired of not dating because they won't approve of the guys I date and sick of listening to her every single week, ""will you be in heaven with us?""

TITLE: What's your, ""Everything happens for a reason"" story?

POST: My story:

I was not the most hardworking kid in highschool and therefore found it extremely difficult to find scholarships or grant money for when i actually started going to college.

In November 2011, I moved in with my grandparents. Almost immediately, i got a job in order to pay for my college expenses. At the time my grandparents were having an incredibly hard time supporting themselves, let alone me. I had been basically fiscally abandoned by my parents with little to no money, to my name. Anyways my grandparents were beginning to think about filing for bankruptcy. My grandfather was on his way home from work one day early in October (2012), fell asleep at the wheel and was killed in the resulting car crash. His life insurance settlement paid off for nearly 500k. My grandfather whom i loved with all my heart, wanted nothing more than to see me get a college education. Now just shortly after 7 months later, I'm graduating with my associate's degree with a 4.0. Hopefully in another few years, i'll be on my way to being a surgeon, and making enough money to take care of my grandmother, who has helped take care of me.

POST: Hi all! I'm 25/m 5'8"", been dieting and exercising for about 12 weeks now. Dropped about 20 pounds, starting at 240 and currently standing at 218 this morning. When I started, I stayed away from a lot of social gatherings and just focused on my program. Well honestly I was just a bit self-conscious about how much I gained. I also have a skin condition on my face that causes rashes to break out a lot. Anyway, I skipped out on a lot of birthdays, graduations, etc. Around week 8 I felt confident enough to start going out again, the diet has pretty much eased the rashes on my face and I'm more clear than I have been in awhile. My friends noticed my weight loss immediately. These days I'm starting to attend more gatherings and kind of regretting it, haha. I find it hard to stay away from all the drinks and snacks that come along with it. From starting at a pace of 2-5 pounds lost every week, I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully I haven't gained.

TITLE: How do I get a solid response from a girl I've asked out 3 times and gotten an iffy response in return, but I KNOW is interested in me?

POST: I met this girl on Okcupid. We hit it off and after a few messages I asked her out to dinner in which she replied ""I'm really busy for the next couple weeks, but I'll see what I can do"". I figure she's letting me down nicely and never expect to hear from her again.

Four days later she messages me back with her number! Word. We text back and forth a few times over the next few days and I ask her out one more time and I get the same sort of response. However, I figure she's being honest because she not only gave me her number in the first place, but has talked about sex, that she wanted to teach me how to dance, and all this other stuff that proved she was really interested. If anything, the fact she keeps responding to me, someone she's never even met, tells me she's being honest.

So after this, I go on vacation to Florida where I am currently (it's been almost two weeks). I asked her if she was busy next week again, but made a rookie mistake, gave her another thread at the same time, and she latched onto that instead of the real inquiry I was interested in. Oh well. A few days later (about 3 or 4 days ago) I ask her again and she replies ""I'll see what I can do :)"".

So here I am today. I get back on Friday. I've been talking to this girl somewhat for roughly 3 weeks. What do I say to get her to commit to a date on Saturday? If she gives me another iffy response should I keep trying MORE? I mean as long as she's responding, she's clearly interested right? I just don't want to come off as pathetic seeing as this is like the 4th time I've asked her out.

TITLE: TIFU By Texting My Sister.

POST: This happened last Friday night, but the consequences didn't fall upon my person until today.

Bit of a back story for relevance - I am temporarily living with my Mother again and she stared dating this guy, we'll call him ""Stew"". Stew is a major doucher and uses her, then makes her feel like shit, when I come home from work I have to deal with it. They've been on and off dating for 5 months now.

So last Friday night Stew and my Mother have another falling out, where my Mother comes home all upset because he is being a major asshole again. After she settles down and goes to bed, I text my sister about it. I wax poetic of how much of a prick Stew is and how I am tired of having to run damage control.

Just as I send it, I realize that instead of starting a new conversation with my sister, I actually responded to an old group text my Mother sent to me, my sister and... Stew.

The next day when I come home from work my Mother says she was pretty pissed at me, at first, but then realized I was right and told Stew this was wake up call for both of them. From the way she put it, it was implied everything was fine and they even made plans to go out of town next weekend.

So today I come home from work and my Mother is in tears, informing me Stew just broke up with her, and he used my text message as an excuse. She then goes on to tell me she'd rather be treated like shit then be alone.

Now my whole family hates me.

TITLE: TIFU by texting my mom a pornhub video link

POST: Alright, so I couple days ago i was browsing the hubs, if you know what I mean, on my phone. To be honest, I was in the mood for a quick boosh before I hopped in the shower. I was looking for videos to go along with my boosh and I noticed the video would not play. I copied the video link to try it in a few different browsers.

Fast forward to today, My dad and I have been looking for a car to purchase. We both went to look at one today and both my mom and aunt wanted to know what it was like. I texted my aunt first, explaining how it went. This is where the fuck up is. After i sent the message to my aunt, i tried to copy it so i can send it to my mom too since i'm too lazy to type one seperate for her. You can probably guess what went wrong. IT DIDN'T FUCKIN' COPY. I go to my mom and I's text conversation and I paste the pornhub video link (when i thought it would be what i sent to my aunt) and hit send immediately after i paste it. Lo and behold, I send a pornhub link to my mom.

I started to panic, not that i would be embarrassed or anything, but it is my mom i sent it to. That is a little weird. After i sent the link, i simply texted ""Woops, meant to send something else"" and then I pasted what was meant to be sent in the first place. She didn't say anything about the pornhub link, so I think she was completely oblivious to it. I haven't spoken to her in person yet, hopefully i got away with it.

TITLE: Credit cards and Credit History. Is it safe to close old accounts?

POST: Hello!

I hope that someone can lend me some advice for a situation that I find myself in. Here's my situation:

About 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.

Now, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.

Recently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.

Now my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.

Will closing this account greatly affect my credit score?

I even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...

Any advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR:","  I have an old credit card account that I no longer use, and am considering closing it and applying for a cash rewards card as my savings/checking accounts are with them.

TITLE: Landlord sold property - New landlord trying to increase rent during lease period.

POST: My fiance signed a lease with three friends last year, that started June 1st, 2014 (through May 31st 2015).  A month before that time, after being diagnosed with cancer, the landlord sold all his properties to a rental company.  The new company stated at that time that they'd honor all the old landlord's leases.

Fast forward to today, October 1st.  In this college city, leases that start on June 1st get signed in October for the previous year.  My fiance and her roommates intend on renting the property again (June 1st 2015 through May 31st 2016).  However, the rental company not only wants them to sign the lease for the next year, but sign one of their leases that superseeds the current one.  This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that they are also trying to raise the rent on the *current* lease by $30 per month.

My understanding is that a lease can't be altered by either party unless it is mutually agreed upon.  I don't know if that's the case if the property is sold, however.  Anyone have experience with this?

TITLE: Fiancee [30F] wants an expensive wedding. How can I [30M] talk her down without looking cheap?

POST: My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a ""$60k wedding"" and ""the groom/his family"" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.

We can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.

The problem is that I don't want to just say ""no"" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.

What can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated

POST: I recently started dating this woman, or rather started dating this woman again. I asked her out three years ago and we went on a few dates, and we didn't click. We remained friends, and we recently both found ourselves single. So, she asked me out to rekindle what we had going before. 

What attracted her to me was how much I had changed. Three years ago I was really immature with no real direction in life. Now, seven months after a devastating break up, I completely turned my life around. I've lost over 50 pounds. I'm exercising, eating clean and all around taking care of myself. Life is going awesome for me now.

So, she's back in the picture. Things are going really great between us. I'm trying new things with her that I haven't done with other women. I used to be a somewhat cold, cerebral person and not very affectionate. Now, I'm taking chances. I'm not overanalyzing and looking for ""signs"". I got handsy on her on our second date, I took a chance and kissed her. These things would take months in previous relationships. 

I've also decided to be more communicative. She likes to text, so I've reciprocated by texting her quite a bit. I've never been really chatty on text, but again, why not, I'm going to text as the mood strikes me, rather than again overanalyzing. We'll probably send each other like ten texts a day, although I find myself texting her more.

She gave some feedback to me which has got me thinking. She said that I'm too available. I'm not much of a challenge. Now I'm getting back into overanalysis mode. I sense I might be beginning to turn her off. How can I adjust my communication pattern with her to not be so ""available"" and be more ""challenging""?

POST: It's really kind of ridiculous. We'd been friends for so long, and when feelings started developing, I wasn't really surprised. I told her how I felt and she said it was the same for her, so we became a couple and it was really great. She was the first I'd been with that really supported me in my decisions, and I supported her in hers. 

When she left, it was so sudden I was really taken aback. She only ever said anything doubting us months beforehand, and when I asked to try and talk it out and help her feel better about it, she shrugged it off. I told her I would do anything to help make things the way she wanted them, but she said everything was alright, and for a while it was. 

We still talk sometimes, but god, every time I'm screaming in my head wondering what I did wrong. It's not even that I feel the need to be with her again, because I feel like it's important for us to find out the kind of person we want to be with and she decided I wasn't it. It's rough, but that's her decision. 

I just want to know why she chose to end it when it seemed so great. Now we just stay quiet and pretend it never happened, which is the worst part because we used to be so open with each other, well before we ever had any romance. Now that old friendship is gone.

The most recent show is a large scale musical, that requires hundreds of hours of research and construction, with lights and set.  **She is asking me for my sketches and other materials to put up in her classroom to ""teach"" her class how it is done.**  She likes to come in to the shop and try to change things.  

First of all there is no time, because she waits till the last minute to do everything.  

Secondly, she doesn't know what she's talking about.  

I feel like my methods (along with creativity) of designing are part of why my designs stand out.  I don't really want to share all of my research material with her because:                              

**1.** I worked really hard getting my degree in design and graduated with honors, and I don't feel responsible for teaching her how to do her job better. 

**2.** If I give her my info she will most likely come into the shop more often telling me how to do my job, wasting more time that I never have. 

What do I do without jeopardizing the relationship?

TL;DR:","  Helping a high school teacher with set and lights, she wants my research and design ideas to help her teach her class.  Don't want to jeopardize friendship.

TITLE: I (22/f) am crazy about my boyfriend (27/m), but we haven't been dating long. Should I wait to tell my family how close we are?

POST: Reddit, I am so insanely, head over heels in love with my boyfriend, J. 

Humble bragging about us: We met when I moved to a new area for my job in July/August. We had been really great friends for months and ended up getting together on Valentine's day. We got very serious very quickly and have spent nearly everyday together since (admittedly, it's a little bit much but it's the honeymoon phase and we can't get enough of each other).  I don't think I could have dreamt of a better match for me. J's brilliant, creative, confident and unbelievably kind. His humor is clever and nerdy and immature in all of the right ways. He is so thoughtful and amazing at communicating, which is especially important because that is not my best trait. I've never been able to talk to anyone the way I can with him... And I've opened up more with J than I ever thought I would (with anyone). I could go on for pages just gushing about how infatuated I am with him. 

Needless to say, we're both serious about this... we've said the I-love-you's and started looking for apartments to move in together in June. We're talking about long-term plans and I've already met a huge chunk of his family. It's real. I never would have imagined myself to jump into a relationship this quickly or intensely, but it's really real. And I'm thrilled!

I want to yell it from treetops and tell the world... but I'm worried that people might think I'm being silly or naive and rushing into it. I am very close with my family and desperately want to tell them that I love him  and how serious we've gotten but I would be really upset if they wrote it off as some sort of tryst. 

So that leads me to my question: Can I tell my family about my intense, new relationship? Or should I wait it out and bring it up on a more ""normal"" timeline?

TL;DR:",  I'm crazy about my boyfriend of a few months but we haven't been dating long. Should I tell my family about how serious we are or should I wait it out and bring it up on a more normal timeline?,  I love my boyfriend after ~6weeks of dating him. The 'pace' of the relationship doesn't bother me but I'm worried my family will write this off if I told them about it now.

POST: So, currently in college (that's our way of saying before university in the UK) and i've been with this girl for a year and a half. I love her, and think she's amazing. But the downside is, i'm 18. I want to go and experience lots of different things in lots of different places, but I can't go and travel and do amazing things with her. I want to go and do these things myself and make new friends. 

I'm worried however, that if I approach her with this she'll go for it, but when I come back she'll have moved on with the relationship. We both feel the same way about each other, that's clear. Another point to make is that she has made plans to go and travel around Australia herself. 

This may seem like a very selfish post, however I hope you can all understand that i'm young and want to expand my knowledge of the world and have my own individual experiences. For this to happen i'm looking at 2 or so years. Which is a long time I know, but as the title says, I met her too young.

Own a reliable vehicle paid off. No large property owned aside from the car.

Income $6780.84 a month before taxes, SS, Medicare, etc.
Rent & utilities is about $1200 a month.

Deposit $458 every month into Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund 2045 (Currently at $11,460.24).

The remainder I save in my checking account and use for food, fuel, and any other costs.

After I have $20,000 saved up for my emergency fund, I'd like to save at least $50,000 for a down payment on a home. I don't see myself purchasing a home anytime soon but would like to keep the option available by preparing for it.

The nature of my profession requires constant relocation. So I won't buy a home probably till I retire or decide I'm tired of moving every few years and change careers. Is this a good course of action? 

If yes, is there a recommended method to save that $50,000 while earning interest safely and ability to withdraw it without penalties?

If no, what other options should I consider?

POST: Hey guys I need some serious advice on something, my girlfriend of 6 months is losing her sex drive big time, and its really putting a damper on our relationship.

We both have talked about it numerous times but at the end of the day I can't shake the feeling that whenever we do it (1-2 times a week) its only because she knows I'll be upset if we don't.

It never used to be this way when we first started dating, and then she went on BC, which we have both discussed as a possible reason for the decline in her sex drive, but she doesn't want to go off of it and she doesn't seem to mind the lack of sex. 

What truly bothers me about all of it is that I genuinely feel like she doesn't even enjoy it anymore, and therefore the sex itself is sucking, a lot.  

All I wanna know is if laying off of initiating, (which lately has been every time were alone in my room, and getting denied like 40-50% of the time) will help, or if she will merely see it as a relief and be content with rarely ever having sex anymore. help reddit!

She has now finished her packet and isn't going to get a prescription so for the foreseeable future (she see's me wearing the condom as good enough, and wants a ""break"" from artificial hormones).

TITLE: Should I [22f] ditch this guy [27m], or am I jumping to conclusions too quickly?

POST: We've been dating for about a month or so.

The good about him: he's taken me out to dinner, parties, breakfast, etc. He texts me nearly every day. He seems to communicate well, he's told me that he is looking for a relationship and that he likes me, etc. He told me that he doesn't like to 'hook up' with girls, that he likes to take it 'one at a time.' He said he likes being in relationships.

The bad: the last time we hung out, he seemed disinterested. I felt like I was having to carry the conversation. He didn't actually say much at all during dinner, and we just went home and passed out. One time at a party, I saw him going downstairs with a girl. I followed, and they were hanging out with a bunch of people smoking weed. It got me suspicious. He hasn't mentioned anything about us getting exclusive since we last talked about it awhile back. He seems to party a lot. He doesn't really compliment.

The thing is, I like him, but I don't want to get hurt.

Am I just being over-analytical or is this guy a douche that is just leading me on? Also, how would I tell him that I no longer want to see him?

I have been in a relationship for about three + years now. 
Short summary: Long distance relationship, will live together in a month, happy relationship, skyping a lot daily; result of that is that I have only 1 close friend (who's moving 300 kilometers away this august) and 2 friends I do not see often. Because I skype a lot and don't do sports anymore I do not have many contacts outside my SO/family. 

I miss laughing, netflix'ing and being lazy with someone (other than my SO) to socialize with. The thing is, he's kind of jealous (distance makes it hard to not go crazy sometimes) and he thinks everyone I meet (example: at work or study) is somehow into me. I do not engage into a social/more-than-colleague relationship because I do not want to cause any trouble. 

Does anyone of you have advice for me about finding a balance? Or how to make my SO accept male-friends/contacts? Make him less jealous? My relationship is very important for me and keeps me going every day. 

Sometimes I just feel like talking about the stuff going on in my head other than my SO [he knows everything anyway] and want to hear another opinion. Right now I feel like I have no one to talk to beside him.

TITLE: I (33M) after recent breakup, don't know if I'm ready for dating again

POST: Hi everyone.

Recently my long term relationship ended, and I'm still struggling with some issues after the break up. Let me summarise:

I was in a relationship for 8 years, half of that living together, which seemed to go very nicely as we were even organising our wedding just before the break up. But important changes in life (mainly me moving to another country for a new job) ended up revealing some insecurities, lies, and finally ending the relationship due to lack of willing to go forward by my ex-partner.

This happened 6 months ago, and even if at the start it was very hard, suddenly living alone in a different country when months ago I was planning a wedding and considering having kids, I was lucky as I joined a very nice group of people at work and my old friends even if far away have helped a lot.

After the first months of missing my ex, it transitioned to just missing being with someone, and then I was able to just focus on myself, enjoying life and improving both my body and mind.

And then... I started considering looking for women and dating. The problem is that I'm not really sure that I'm really prepared for a new relationship, or if I'm looking at it because I feel alone. This was my only serious relationship, so this is unexplored territory for me. Thinking cold about it, I kinda believe that I should wait until I don't feel the need to not be alone (6 months after 8 years is not that much after all). But at the same time I think that this relationship has showed me how much a family guy I am and that I really want to share my life with someone. And being 33 I'm starting to think that I don't have that much time if I want that type of life too..

My question is, how do you know when you are ready to date again, if wanting to be in a relationship is something that you are not going to just forget?

TL;DR:","  After a very serious relationship ended 6 months ago, I'm not sure if I'm ready for dating again.

POST: Okay, so I have a lot of feelings still for my ex, not in the ""HEY LETS DATE"" again way just emotion I suppose, we broke up (she ended it with me) but used to get angry if I would date someone else. 

She wanted to be friends but yeah, she'd get angry and block me if I went on a date with someone and she found out. It left me in a very weird situation because I like my ex, she's a nice person and I'd prefer her to be in my life rather than completely gone.

few months ago she went out with another guy which is fine but I'm not sure why, the guy she went out with was everything she hated in a guy and I felt like she did it to kind of wind me up by letting me know what they're up to etc. 

Low and behold we had an argument as she found out I was now in a relationship with someone else and we're going great :). when my ex found out she hit the roof with stuff, refused to meet up and talk everything through like adults, wouldn't pick up the phone and eventually blocked me on Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook etc, saying don't contact her.

He also gets along quite well with my cat(he will sometimes bark and try to play with the cat -.-) but other than that they will lay right next to each other and go to sleep. So after having the dog for 2 weeks I thought I would bring him to the vet to turn in his papers and register him in the system. Before doing so, my dog has been around 20+ new people and I've never had any issues with aggression. (No hand biting, growling, snapping, etc) He is really shy around someone he first meets but other than that he's fine. As soon as I got to the vet my dog was clearly nervous/scared/anxious.

Once our name was called, however, the noise from inside scared him out again.(trying to go back out and having his tail down) The lady who takes my dog is clearly irritated at the type of breed I have. She talked to me as if I knew nothing about the breed and snapped angrily about how aggressive the breed was. After waiting for the nurse to return with my dog she proceeded to tell me about how my dog is EXTREMELY people aggressive and ill have a lawsuit on my hands if I don't fix it. Then handed me 50 million pamphlets on dog trainers in my area. What should I do? What's the best course of action? Get my dog evaluated? Or go to a different vet?

POST: Several years ago, a few drinking buddies and I were driving to Virginia on vacation. After driving for nearly 16 hours straight, we stopped for dinner one night in Maryland. I forget the name of the town or the eatery, but we ate at this little cafe right on the main drag. We were too tired to realize it at the time but the place only served vegan meals. Being the incredible dumbasses that we are, we neglected to read the menu and instead ordered cheeseburgers in the hope that we could eat quick and get back to driving.

The meals come out and we scarf them down, totally oblivious to the  other patron's horror. We pay for our meal and get back on the road, intent on making our destination by morning. About an hour later, we all start to feel rumblies in our tummies.

What happened next will go down in legend.

Simultaneously, the four of us get violently ill inside my buddy's truck. Somehow, and to this day I thank him for it, he gets off to the shoulder of the road and we all sprint for ditch. For the next half hour, anyone on 95 going South could see four rednecks losing their non-vegan, vegan chef prepared meals in the most horrible way possible. It was so bad that even after we were done, none of us could eat or drink anything besides ice chips the rest of the trip

TITLE: TIFU by helping my dad split logs

POST: 2 years ago hurricane sandy came through, and we actually made out pretty well. A fucking massive tree did fall on my house, but it hit another tree on the way down, and that kinda softened the blow. In any case, after a lot of other stories, we got the tree off the house.

My family is pretty good at making the best of things, and we thought ""well, now we have a few thousand pounds of firewood!"". We have a fireplace that we like to use.

You can't use the logs right away because they have to dry out. I honestly don't remember if we split any last year, but even this year we have plenty left. So, I figured I'd be a good sport and help out, and split some logs.

My dad was in an accident recently, and broke his wrist, so wielding an axe isn't exactly something that's very comfortable for him. Another incentive for me to help out. It's at this point that I should note- He got a brand new handle for the axe about 2 weeks ago.

I grab the axe (actually a maul but whatever) and the sledge, and he gives me some pointers. I hit like 4 logs off center, and make real crappy attempts. At this point I'm feeling like I'm not helping much, but he's cool about it.

On the 5th or 6th log I over swing, and BAM I bust the head clean off the handle. I casually tossed the handle down, looked at my dad, and said ""well, looks like I owe you a handle."" I felt pretty damn bad.

Fortunately he was cool about it, and said that's part of learning.

TL;DR:","  Helping my dad split logs, over swing and bust the head off the handle, casually tossed the handle down and said I owe you a handle.","  Tried to help dad who can't really split logs due to injury, busted the axe apart, he was pretty cool about it."

TITLE: Reddit, what's your most regrettable ""Socially Awkward Penguin"" moment?

POST: So I was visiting San Francisco for the weekend, and I sort of got sucked into attending a ""Florence + Machine"" concert. I wasn't too excited to be spending my Friday night there but I dealt with it. We were in the assigned seating section and I was glad to see that my seat was next to a very cute blonde gal. After a few minutes, this girl giving me signs that she might be interested in me. As the night went on, these signs became more and more obvious and I wanted to strike up a conversation so badly...but instead I sat there awkwardly the entire night, too afraid to even look in her direction. At one point I thought that if I consumed some alcohol I would think of something great to start the conversation with, but I ended up acting becoming even more awkward. The reason I regret this is because now that I'm back home from California, I have absolutely no way of knowing who she was, where she was from, or if she was actually interested. Plus I'll never be able to explain why I was such an awkward asshole! 

I have to finish with saying that I work in a job that requires me to constantly socialize with people so I have no idea what the hell happened to me to make me freeze.

TL;DR:","  Was at a concert, girl seemed to be interested, froze and acted very awkward the entire night, have no idea who she was or where she was from now.","  A very cute girl I saw at a concert spent an entire evening trying to get me to talk to her.

TITLE: Do my (F25) parents need to meet my SO's (M27) parents?

POST: So my SO's mother lives over 5 hours away from us and my family. She is coming to visit and has made a point of saying how she expects that she will be invited for a dinner or something with my parents.

We have been living together for close to a year, probably going to get married, though I'm not really sure yet. 

I would prefer to wait until we decide to get engaged for this meeting to happen because his mom is bat-shit crazy and talks endlessly about random shit like stories about people we do not know and never will know. 

At the same time she makes no effort to get to know us. She says that ""she loves me as her own family"" yet really knows nothing about me because on the occasions when we go to visit she doesn't let me get a word in and doesn't seem to want to talk about anything of relevance.

I know my parents' personalities wont jive with her personality, and worry that them getting together is a shit-show waiting to happen. Add this to the fact that I'm not 100% sure on whether I want to marry this guy, I just don't think I should be forced to set up an awkward meeting between my parents and his mother.

We did have a discussion about it before, but he ended up just getting frustrated and dropping it so as to not jeopardize our relationship. But I still feel he is resentful about this and I'm sure it will come up closer to the time when his mother is going to visit.

Am I being fair? How can I explain this to my SO without coming off as being stubborn?

TITLE: My [36/F] coworker [late 20's/M] who inappropriately hit on me just asked me to write him a letter of recommendation

POST: I am in a very happy relationship and a guy I work with flirted with me a few months back.  He said that he found me ""stunning,"" but he said it in a casual way in the middle of a conversation when we were consulting about something else that was fairly serious.  I was very uncomfortable with it and told my boyfriend about it, which then made him uncomfortable.  He said I did nothing wrong, which I agree with, and since then I've tried to avoid the co-worker as much as possible.

Also since then, it came out that he hooked up with a colleague at work and then treated her poorly, causing her to be so upset she quit the job.  I have noticed many many more ways that he is inappropriate, has horrible boundaries and moreso just has huge issues.  We work in the mental health field and I have a higher position and degree than him so it REALLY bothers me to see how he acts.

Today he asked if I would write a letter of recommendation for him to go to counseling school.  I personally think he could be a good clinician, if he had more training, so I think it's a great idea for him to learn boundaries, ethics, theories, etc.  However, I feel really weird about writing him a letter of recommendation, mainly because my boyfriend was uncomfortable with him flirting with me, and also because I don't think he has good judgement at the moment, but he could eventually have it with the proper training.  I'm a people pleaser so in the moment I said yes.  But now I feel awkward, what do I do?

POST: We both have amazing chemistry and it seems we're almost always on the same page. We're both pretty infatuated with each other. Never before had I had the urge to text a girl almost daily (and I'm known as a horrible texter), see a girl often or really get to know them.

We both have never been in a relationship before and are typically scared of commitment. I mentioned last week that I felt we were moving too fast and we should take it slow. I told her I don't want to hurt her if we don't work out and she said she's strong if it happens, and that she said we'll see where time takes us. 

We had one drunken talk this past weekend and admitted our feelings to each other. I said I was falling in love with her and she said she really liked me. At one point in the conversation, she almost said I love you...but stopped. She started getting emotional and started crying and I wasn't sure if it was out of happiness and/or sadness. She said she never gone this far with a guy and I mentioned the same. I said for us to be monogamous but not official to determine if our feelings are real and not circumstantial. 

At these times when I talk about the state of our relationship, I feel like she always agree with what I say and doesn't give any dissent. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. 

I'm probably being an asshole right now. I feel like I'm trying to fight the feeling of falling in love/being in love because I've never felt these feelings before and things are going too smoothly to be true.

TITLE: Me (26m) have had a falling out with a good friend (25f), but I need to tell her something.

POST: Hello everyone, first off, sorry for the vague title, I suck at titles apparently, let's hope I don't suck at typing the rest ;)

Obligatory mobile/non native sentence.

Long story short, I have/had a very good friend (25f), we had a very good bond but for the past few weeks we had a falling out. 

The problem however is that she is in a bad situation with someone else, her dancing teacher, whom she had an argument with. 
I know her teacher personally as well, so I know every detail of the situation since a few days (before that I wasn't really digging into their problem but it came up in a conversation).

Now the thing is, I know what to say to both of them so that they can resolve their problem, something I know will make my friend a lot happier. 

However, I know she won't like me (or anyone for that matter) interfering with her life and chances are she won't react positive towards me nomatter the outcome.

So what do you guys think I should do?

Option A is I keep completely out of it, nothing changes.

Option B is I do what is necessary for them to fix their problem.

Honestly I care more for her being happy (dancing is a BIG thing for her) then her being pissed at me, hell, I'd see it as an heroic sacrifice, she'll hate me but her she can go back and do something she loves.

So I'm leaning towards B, get myself involved, fix this for her, nomatter the fallout. 

So people, advice please, are you going to talk me into it or out of it?

Cheers!

TITLE: What's the whole 'WakeUpNow' business opportunity and how legitimate is it?

POST: Recently a couple of people I know started promoting this business called 'WakeUpNow'. They were explaining to me how they are this business that offers discounts on travel, groceries, and many other expenses, and it is an opportunity for you to make money by marketing their business. I was told that the system works by getting a certain number of friends & family to 'sign up' with this business, and then when you have enough people under you then you can start earning $600 to $10k a month, just by solely marketing the business & signing people up, and supposedly they offer you take vacations at huge discounts, just by ""taking a picture of the receipt and posting on a social media website and claim 'in a business meeting', and then the company reimburses you"". Now doing some research, some people say they are a scam and don't do it, others say it is a legit business and not a pyramid scheme.

I'm looking for legitimate answers. Is it pyramid scheme? How does this company generate money? Anyone on Reddit have experience (good or bad) with this company. **I am not interested in this company**, I'm just digging for details on what this company is about?

TITLE: [21 M/F] Just Started Seeing This Girl and Her Ex Is Threatening to Hill Himself

POST: Met a great girl last week, we've been clicking so fast and I know that we have something great going for us. We went out on our first date and she explained to me her situation with her ex, which had me in awe and I did not really know what to tell her.

She was about to break up with her ex when I think he started to sense she was going to. They were staying in a hotel for the weekend, and he threatened to kill himself by jumping off a balcony. When she tried to restrain him he threw her away where she ended up going through a glass table. To add fuel to the fire he began telling people she raped him on the trip and he doesn't trust her anymore.

The worst part is he texts her just about everyday and she is clueless on how to handle it. She doesn't want to feel responsible if she does end up killing herself, and she complies to talk to him just to avoid this. She assured me there are no feelings at all, but she does it because she couldn't live with herself.

I literally had no idea how to respond. I told her I was glad she was sharing this with me, but I really don't know how the handle the situation. Usually when people say they're going to kill themselves over a girlfriend, it's just to find a little glimmer of hope and to hold on to something that is not there. This girl has a huge heart and I think she really doesn't want to feel that guilt.

How do I go about helping her out in this situation? It seems really tricky and I don't want to get in the middle, but I really like this girl and he needs to back the fuck off.

TITLE: I[22/F] suspect my guy-friend[24/M] who wants to sleep with me is still taken and using me to sleep around with

POST: My friend 'Sean' and I have known each other for a little over three years. We're fairly good friends, but somewhat fell out of contact a while ago when he graduated from our university. We share a pretty large friend group, though, and they usually know how he's doing and trying to invite him to our outings. Through the group I knew that Sean was dating 'Maggie', a younger girl(19) from out of town. 

But last April, Sean contacted me out of the blue and started striking up conversations over messenger, ostensibly to seehow I was. I enjoyed talking to him again after a few months of no contact, and soon after our conversations started he told me he had been thinking about me and wanted to sleep together at some point. I asked if he was still with Maggie, and he said he had broken up with her the past month.

We continued to banter the following months, and eventually scheduled our first 'date' for this upcoming Saturday. I was pretty excited, and was hanging out with some of the guys from our friend group today. Sean's best friend, 'Matthew', didn't seem to know that Sean and I were seeing each other, which struck me as weird since Sean tells Matthew everything. Later that day, Matthew also offhandedly mention that he had been hanging out with ""Sean and his girlfriend"" last weekend.

I'm not sure if it's a misunderstanding or if I'm overreacting, but I'm worried that Sean may still be seeing Maggie and trying to sleep with me behind her back. I had a big crush on him a year or so ago(which he knew about and did not return at the time), and I'm worried he might just be trying to take advantage of me and my feelings. How do I broach this subject with him without sounding accusatory?

POST: I've heard that phrase 2 or 3 times and I've had enough. Sometimes I feel like she wants ME to end the relationship for whatever reason. After a small argument we had, it went something like this.

Her: ""Why are we still dating if I make you feel angry/sad?""

Me: ""Because I love you? Are you telling me that you want this to end?""

Her: ""No"" 

Me: ""So why did you bring that up?""

Her: ""I love you so much and it's not like I want to solve this by breaking up, but I don't want to hurt you""

She's very sweet and she always tells me how ""happy"" she is with me, our sex life is great (she lost her virginity with me), we always have a great time when we are together, etc... Most of our problems are caused by lack of communication or misunderstandings.

Lately I've had a ""feeling"" that shes hiding something from me, she's ""acting"" normal, but I just have that strange feeling that something is not ""right"", for example, a few days ago she went out with her sister (that's what she told me, honestly I'm not sure) to do some errands, she was SO reserved when she was explaining me what she was doing, where she was and why she didn't replied to my messages... Some stuff seemed a little bit ""suspicious"".

When she goes out with her sister (or her mom) she always messages me ""We are almost home"", but that day she wrote ""I'm almost home"", implying she was alone. Maybe I'm just f****** crazy. We live like 3 hours away so we only see each other like once per week.

TITLE: ""Give the goat head""?

POST: A coworker of mine said, ""I'll run some preliminary tests first before I give you the goat head"" over AIM. 

Should I have corrected him? If so, how should I have responded?

I'm asking reddit because there are a lot of people who have (strong) opinions on grammar nazis and when to behave like one. 

My opinion is that so long as the main message is conveyed well enough, I don't say a word. (For example, everyone knows what a grammar nazi is. Should I have taken the time to find out whether ""grammer"" and/or ""nazi"" should be capitalized? I don't think so.) But I also wouldn't mind if someone corrected me. It's kind of for my own edification, and I think it improves how well I can express myself with words.

So, in the case with my convo with my coworker, I didn't say anything because I knew what he meant. But I also thought, ""What if he uses that phrase incorrectly again? What if someone corrects him later and he thinks that I don't know the correct usage because I didn't say anything?"" I might be thinking about this too much. 

Anyway, what would you have done?

POST: Ok. So I was hooking up with a cowoker (I know, horrible idea) for about two weeks back in August before I broke things off. There were several red flags: 

1) I told me he ""loved"" me after about three days.

2) He didn't understand the word no, and I had to either yell at him to stop trying to have sex with me or physically leave the room for him to get the message (made even worse by the fact that I, myself, have been raped and he was aware of this.

3) There were two/three incidents when I was in bed, naked, mostly asleep, he had his phone out and pointed towards me. 

4) When I tried to end things, he grabbed my wrists really freakin' hard and pulled me towards him while yelling ""NO!"", and that I couldn't break up with him because he loves me (I'm 133, he was like 200? of solid muscle). Super scary.

Now, I don't know for sure if he actually took any photos of me. But he recently switched to working the night shift, where I work middle shift - so I do still have some interaction with the night shift people. Since he started working nights, people at work have started treating me differently. 

So, I don't know what to do. The last time I saw him at work, I said we needed to talk, but was running late for the bus, so I had to go. I gave it two days and then texted him about it. No response. Any advice? I am partially hesitant to see him one-on-one as he did scare me a lot...but I feel like I have to know what's going on and if he took any pictures of me.

TITLE: Speeding down highway. Can I get a ticket?

POST: 18, Male, Tennessee.
I was speeding, like 120 in a 65. Some girl kept trying to speed up with me in a shit car, I drive a turbo g35 it was no match but she wouldn't budge she'd push her little car around trying to pass me, and obviously putting her life in danger, I'm no godly driver but I know my car, and the road. I knew what I could do speed wise, and I constantly took it back to around 80 before she'd speed up. Eventually I had to turn, and she held up her phone, and a piece of paper, I assumed it was her number but now that I think about it she probably got my tags and plans to report or something, I want to know could I get in trouble?

POST: I'm looking for some advice - I babysat a kitten over the weekend who it seems like just started getting fleas.  The owner had been aware of the flea dirt, but didn't do anything about it (and also didn't tell me that this was happening).  I found a few adult fleas on the kitten, and informed the owner and told her she needs to treat the kitten.  Now, I'm wondering what I should do about my apartment.  It seems like this was early on in terms of when the fleas started, however, I'm worried because I was hoping to adopt a new cat soon as my former cat passed away earlier this month.  Do you guys have any advice for how to treat my apartment and also how worried should I be about possible flea infestation?

POST: Just got inside from my apartment balcony after a half hour of trying to fish an envelope off the balcony below me with a tent pole. So I was going to throw my credit card down to my son's mom who was going to buy him some Pop Tarts because I'm on the 3rd floor and she'd just run down with the wrong card by accident and didn't want to come back up. I put it in a random envelope that was on my table just because it felt like the right thing to do before tossing it down and the envelope caught the wind and sailed onto the balcony directly beneath mine, which belongs to an unoccupied apartment. Too far from my balcony or the ground floor for a broom to reach, maintenance guy not available, I ponder 5 minutes or so. A light bulb flashes in my head....tent pole. I inserted each segment of the pole into the end of the other, but ultimately when I held it vertically the weight of it pulled it apart. Pulled it back up, scotch taped each joint (no good tape in the apartment, of course), gave it another 20 minutes, and bam, knocked it to the ground and went down and got it. My son's enjoying a blueberry poptart....Fuck yeah

POST: Background: I had some important things to get done today. I had to pay some extra rent on my place, sort out references and paperwork for a new job I'll be starting next month and a new house (I'll be moving away from where I currently live). I have also recently broken up with my SO of nearly four years, so unsurprisingly I'm an quivering, emotional wreck. 

I've always liked Neil Blomkamp's movies; District 9 was amazing and Elysium was ok. Chappie seemed like a fun-filled, action-packed hour and a half I thought. How wrong I was. I had *no* idea how emotional this film was. Without ruining the film, there's a lot of scenes when Chappie (a robot) learns about the world and starts asking some thought provoking questions about life. I got to a point in the movie and I totally lost it. I was sat there absolutely sobbing my eyes out for some bizarre reason. I'm a reserved guy, and considering the emotional impact my breakup had I did damn well on the crying front. It all came out during this movie. 

Twelve hours later, I have lost the place I was supposed be living at, I'm late sending a contract to my new job, and I forgot to book/schedule a bunch of other semi-important things.

TITLE: How do I [28 M] get over my long-term GF [25 F] of 3 years

POST: So I'm reaching out here because I've been having a hard time essentially getting over my ex, who I felt was the one (it's nearly 3 weeks now since the break up). 

Without warning, we broke up when I found out she had gotten close with someone else during her break (vacation), and she said that she felt different about me when she had come back. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around having 3 years of good times, shared dreams, fears, and goals, and us working toward our future together, to be suddenly undone by one week being away. 

I feel devastated, and having already had trust issues prior due to childhood reasons, and a prior relationship, I feel like they've gotten worse (which I've opened up to her about before). She made me feel secure, loved, and wanted, especially since a lot of family oriented goals were brought up by her first. For everything to be suddenly turned upside down crushed me. 

I'm sure everyone feels this way after a breakup, but I'm just not sure how to handle the emotions that come in waves. You know, some days are better than others, but then I just have bad dreams about it nearly every other night. It also doesn't help that she's already moved on, and already in a committed relationship with this other person, and my mind keeps drifting to it.

So what do I do? I've been wrestling with the idea of reaching out to her somewhere down the line, and trying to seek closure, but I don't think that would be a good idea. I don't know. I'm not really used to this kind of rejection, much less from a relationship that felt like it was going great. Especially since it was someone I felt so comfortable opening up with, and had so much in common with, you know?

TL;DR:",  3 years of a great relationship ended abruptly when my GF got with someone else. Feeling very sad and confused about it all. How do I get over it and move on?,  Found out my ex of 3 years cheated on me with someone during her vacation (broken up for nearly 3 weeks now). How do I get over her? Do I reach out and seek closure sometime?

TITLE: I (28F) just need to vent about my ex (30M) a little

POST: So we were together 5 years and living together most of that time. We broke up two months ago because things were pretty bad and he had a lot of his own issues to deal with. He basically told me that I'm an amazing GF but he's just so fucked up right now in his life that he ends up being a terrible BF and I don't deserve that etc. He told me that he still loves me but he could barely keep his shit together let alone be a decent boyfriend. He just couldn't be in a relationship right now

I understood this, and knowing his past and his problems this made a lot of sense. He was treating me pretty bad the last year of our relationship (i don't mean abusive) just inconsiderate and consumed with his own issues.

Well, two days ago I found out he was seriously dating another woman and I feel absolutely shattered. The break-up was a good thing, for both of us, but I'm stunned he's already dating seriously. 

I feel hurt because I truly felt for him and the tough time he was going through, I cried with him, and now I feel like it was all bullshit. I feel like he actually just wanted to find someone better than me

Anyway I've never felt more rejected in my life. I never thought it would affect me this way but I find myself utterly heartbroken.

TITLE: TIFU by not washing or brushing my teeth for 5 days whilst on a school trip.

POST: So this didn't happen today like many other posts on here. This happened 5 years ago and I went on a residential at school. I arrived at my room with 6 other friends and we all unpacked. I noticed I didn't have my toiletries bag with me. I thought I must have not packed it by mistake. All I have to do is ask one of my friends if I could borrow their stuff. Only, I decide not to do that. 
It was an exercise based trip with a lot of sports in the middle of the summer so it was very hot. I went swimming in the ocean, playing football (Soccer), caving etc. 
I speant all my money on the vending machine buying mints to try to keep my breath smelling bearable and I wore a hat at all times because I can imagine my hair was extremely greasy. 
I can't imagine how bad I smelt and nobody told me. Now here is the worst thing about it. My toiletries bag was with me the entire time.  It's just that when I had to pop out of our room when I was unpacking, one of my friends picked up the bag by mistake and instead of putting it back in my suitcase, they stuck it on the floor behind my suitcase and when I pushed my suitcase under the bed, it pushed the toiletries bag back to the wall. I didn't realise until I was packing to leave when I did a quick sweep to see if I left anything, to find that bag pushed up against the wall.

TITLE: Dog is afraid of the basketball pole that's always been there? (hasn't been afraid of it previously)

POST: I have a chihuahua (pug mix) dog, (1 yr/5 months old). We usually take him for walks around the gated apartment complex, where the gardens are at, the neighbors have a basketball hoop (the ones filled with water to keep it standing). One day they left a carpet out in the sun to dry & he quite like it (he was rubbing/nudging on it & I guess when the thing shook/or when I lifted him to hop on the carpet it scared him).  Ever since he hasn't been ANYWHERE near it, he doesn't want to even go outside anymore near that area (he'll just go potty & come right back inside).  I have tried carrying him over there and just holding him walking towards it, but right when I put him down he runs for his life back home. Tail is in between his legs, never seen him like that before.

He has never been afraid of going over there before at all, EVER, always had to go over there to potty on his usual spots, and has never had a problem until that incident...

I have never seen him afraid of anything before like this.  Also, not sure if this is because recently a neighbor brought their friends dog over to play (near that area/female retriever/poodle mix but he's never seen her).

I have tried to put snacks (in a trail) near there and have him slowly go out so he wouldn't be afraid, but once he eats all the snacks in the trail, he runs right back home.

I have also attempted to put the snacks on the basketball hoop base & he has just eaten the food (or merely ignored it in panic/looking up all the time to see if anything is going to fall on him or something)...

Whenever he leaves his safety area (home) he looks up & around but mostly up... How can I help him see that the basketball hoop is not dangerous? (ie. it's secure & won't fall over anytime soon even in gusty wind conditions)

TITLE: My [18/F] ex BF[18/M] sent me a video of himself and I think I just cheated on my new BF [20/M]

POST: (Background) I just started university this year and before summer I broke up with my HS boyfriend of 2 years. I was in love with him, he was my first in everything and he is undeniably good looking. Unfortunately he turned 18 before me and went to the bar and proceeded to cheat on me while drunk and that ended the relationship.

I'm currently seeing someone I met during orientation and it's pretty serious, I like him, he's different but to be completely honest I'm not as attracted to him as I was with my ex. Anyways a couple nights ago he (my ex) commented on an old instagram picture of us, against my better judgement I replied and we started texting (I thought it was harmless) and it somewhat felt like old times.

Two nights ago I got a message from him and it was a video of him masturbating, of course I was shocked at first but that wore of pretty quickly and I got turned on, like really turned on. He called when I didn't message instantly and I guess we had facetime sex. I felt so horrible when I woke up.

I can't explain it other than I'm still very much attracted to him, he is extremely good looking, I can't not be. I have been ignoring him since then. I had a date with the guy I'm currently seeing tonight but I cancelled because I can't face him, to me it counts as cheating and I was cheated on before and it almost broke me, so I pretended to be sick.

TITLE: How do you stay healthy and ""resist temptation"" in a very unhealthy household?

POST: (bit of a rant ahead) 

My family is *extremely* unhealthy. Both of my parents are obese and my brother is one of those very picky eaters whose diet mainly consists of fast food, frozen junk, and just generally unhealthy meals/snacks. I've been trying for years to get my family to have a more healthy diet, but the most I've managed is getting them to finally buy some frozen vegetables (and I'm the only one who eats them). Needless to say, there isn't a lot of healthy food in my house.

I've managed to avoid becoming extremely unhealthy, but I've always been ""chubby"". I don't know what to do. For a while I said ""fuck it"" and started buying a lot of my own food, but it took up too much room in the kitchen so I had to stop. I still cook almost all of my own meals.

The thing that frustrates me most is that I know first-hand how much easier it is to stay healthy when I'm not surrounded by junk food. When I studied abroad, living in a family who barely had junk on hand, things like chips and pizza were a *treat* like they're supposed to be. Unhealthy foods rarely crossed my mind.

I know there's not really much else to it besides sucking it up and controlling myself, but any kind words or ""tips"" would be helpful. I've recently gained a fair amount of weight and feel like I have to take this very seriously before I start heading down the road of my parents. I have zero real support from anyone around me, so it's difficult.

TITLE: she doesn't know i know -- girlfriend's adderall prescription

POST: Well. I feel like an asshole due to the invasion of privacy but I'll explain that in a second...

It all goes back to when I was driving her car because I didn't have one at the time. I was looking for some kind of chapstick and found a bottle of adderall in the storage between the driver and passenger seat.

I didn't say anything for a couple weeks because I had no idea how to approach it. I finally brought up the subject in a ""general"" way and she told me that she had taken it a couple times when she lived in NYC (1.5 or 2 years ago) but does not take it currently. I THEN brought it up a week later, telling her I FOUND IT by accident, and she said that her therapist had prescribed it but she won't be taking it and won't be getting it refilled.

Here's the horrible part:

I looked at her text messages because part of me didn't trust her. What did I find? A text message to her therapist from this past weekend asking the therapist to refill the prescription for adderall. 

How the hell do I approach this? I only ask because I'm not sure if I should be worried. Do I even say anything or do I just respect privacy? We live together. I'm aware this is amazingly hypocritical but shouldn't she be sharing this with me? Or no? This is the best relationship that's ever happened to me... curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.

TITLE: What's the hungriest you've ever really been?

POST: [This] thread got me thinking about the ""disgusting"" things I'd eat if I was *really* hungry. I don't mean the kind of hungry when lunch is still two hours away and the coffee you had for breakfast isn't helping anymore and you groan to your coworker *""I'm starving!""* I mean hungry like you haven't had a bite to eat in days and you're not sure when you'll eat again.

For me, it was 1994 and I was 20 years old living with my first boyfriend. We often survived on end-of-day leftovers at our crappy fast food jobs. Business got slow and we both got fired from our jobs and we were just too dumb to think about the fact that the money we were spending on cigarettes and Dr. Pepper should *probably* be used for PB&J. 

He got a part time job at KFC so he got at least one free meal a day, and I'd usually walk there to share that with him. It was almost Thanksgiving and his hours got cut back from 24 a week to 18, then 12, then they let him go altogether. Just before he left, he stole a bag of powdered mashed potatoes. (Desperate times, desperate measures?) We ate mashed potatoes for every meal for a week until it was just gone. Then there was nothing, and it was the day after Thanksgiving and all the food pantries were closed, and then it was the weekend and we were SO hungry.

Those three days with nothing but water were probably the longest of my life. Strangely, after the 24 hour mark I stopped feeling hunger pains and just felt tired and moody. Any time I thought about food, I'd drink water or eat ice. (I found out several years later that while I had been starving, my boyfriend had been secretly visiting his family and having lunch or dinner with them. His family hated me, they felt I stole away their little boy, and there's no way they'd have fed me. My family wasn't talking to me because I was ""living in sin"" with him, so I didn't have backup like he did.)

TL;DR:","  Was starving in the mid-late 90s, ate nothing but water for 24 hours straight, felt nothing but tired and moody afterwards. What's the hungriest you've ever really been?","  I once went 3 1/2 days with no food. Physically, it wasn't torture. Psychologically, I thought I'd *die* I never want to be that broke again."

We became fast friends and I realized that was I was starting to develop feelings for her, but these feelings were stronger than I had ever had for anybody before. I was going a little out of my mind keeping my feelings for her in, and finally on Friday I told her my feelings and she essentially said that she gets it, whatever, and we carried on as usual.

Now, when I was going crazy, Ruby really helped me out and gave me good advice. She has consistently given me good advice and been really helpful at any moment in our friendship. Once I told Kim about my feelings, she started to stand out to me. Ruby seemed so... different then.

POST: My SO (30 M) and I (23 F) have decided to take a break due to his holding back for months that he was getting depressed. I have had mental issues my entire life that include OCD, Anxiety and Depression so I understand how hard it was to him and where it was coming from. 

He didn't want to lose me from his life, and I didn't want to lose him. We love the hell out of each other.

Neither of us have had a ""break"" before, and we want it to work/be beneficial.

as he said ""I want to look back on this one day with you and agree that it brought us closer and made us stronger"". 

So, we decided that the onus of contact is on him, and he calls me twice a day to talk. We met up today {had the conversation on Friday} because he *really* wanted to see me. I'll admit i wanted to see him too.

So those who have been on a break, and it was successful please advise!

POST: I come from the city so I'm a veteran public transportation rider. I attend a University where the public transportation isn't in abundance but still reliable. 

Recently my friend has gotten a new car and in excitement, has been using it frequency. This has led to her asking, and later begging me to join her on trips to the store/mall/anywhere off campus. 

At first, I agreed to these trips since she was still in that ""freedom"" phase of owning a car. After a few weeks, she'd started demanding gas money for her service. 

I would normally pay for all my goods and services, but I'm baffled at this. She invites me on this little runs willingly, and mostly to places I do not need/care to go. I have told her often that I would rather use the public transportation as my University student fees pay for it. When I turn her down, she asks again or passive aggressively comments on not spending time with her. 

I do not have a lot of money compared to her. She comes from a rich family and has a fair bit of cash on her at all times. 

I do not understand the underlying issue or how to address it.

TITLE: Should I stay or should I go (24f)

POST: Hello reddit. Sorry for the throwaway, my boyfriend (m27) is the one who introduced me to reddit, so I'm sure he'd find this post if I used my real account. 

My SO and I have been dating for a year and a half. We met at work and saw each other pretty much everyday. Recently he took a new job about 200 miles away so we see each other about every 3 weeks.

My dilemma is that he WILL NOT talk about the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it's hard to be in this LDR without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that thats something we both want. When we were with each other all the time the future didn't seem to matter as much. But now that he's gone and we're trying to stay together I feel like I need some reassurance as to WHY we're engaging in a LDR with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it's worth doing it.

I have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. 

I just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it was one of my friends asking me for advice I would tell them to let him go and move on if he can't make up his mind about you. But for some reason it's harder to see when it's your own life. I know he loves me and I know he's indecisive about almost everything else. Maybe he's taking me sticking by him for granted? I just don't know.

So should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

POST: We've been married for four years, together for five. Suddenly all he wants to do is sniff my asshole and armpits regardless of when I last showered. I love him a lot of want to make him happy but it makes me feel so fucking gross. I've tried to be GGG about it and just let him but it really turns me off and the last thing I want is to have sex with him afterward. I just find myself getting angry and feeling used.

These days it's like he hugs me and cuddles me and them gets on his knees and shoves his face into my ass crack, or he hugs me and tries to shove his hand in my ass crack. I asked him if he could maybe build up to that instead of going for it right out of the gate but he doesn't seem amenable to it. I've started to turn him down every time he reaches for me because I don't want to be sniffed like a dog. I don't even want him to touch me anymore.

He confessed that he really wanted this when we were drunk one night and I said I would try it but I just can't get into it. He wants to stick his tongue into my asshole then kiss me and it makes me want to fucking vomit. He's hinted at wanting to try piss play too. I have absolutely no interest in that.

I don't know what to do. I love him and I feel like I've tried to be as GGG about this as I can but fuck. There is SO MUCH kinky shit I'd be happy to try but why does it have to be this? Bodily wastes and armpit stank just have no appeal for me. I mean if he wanted to do all this shit fresh after a shower, sure, but he doesn't. He seems upset when I shower before bed now.

TITLE: Need insight... Is my(21F) boyfriends(24m) view on marriage normal?

POST: I've been with my boyfriend nearly 3 years, lived together for two.

I've pretty much been ready to get engaged for the last few months, he is not,  which is ok because we are still young, don't really wanna rush into things and I'm ok with waiting. In pretty sure he's my soulmate.  

Living together has been smooth sailing, we just signed a lease for another year. We're both tidy enough, split chores evenly, finances in order. Normal stuff. We don't really fight. 

Anyways, we were talking about marriage and the future and he thinks that being married will be hard. I asked why he thought that and he said living with another person is hard. I asked him if living with me currently was hard, he said no. This didn't make sense to me obviously. So he goes on to say that after about 4 yrs of being together then ""biologically"" staying together in a marriage is just about having ""sheer willpower"", as if it's a struggle staying together longer than that. 

Ok I know marriage can be hard, I watched my parents stay in a shitty marriage for years with constant fighting. I know things change after the honeymoon phase (pretty sure we are past that by now). But I don't think people only stay together because of ""willpower"". It kinda makes me feel sad that he has that expectation of me in the future. 

Is there any truth to this point of view? Is he mistaken? I just don't understand where he got that idea, his parents have been together for 27 years and are very happy it seems. 

Am I just naive to think marriage won't be that bad? I mean we already live together, how much more will things change?

TL;DR:",  Boyfriend thinks marriage is hard after about 4 yrs of being together. Says after that biological staying together is just sheer willpower. Is there any truth to this?

POST: My problem is extremely simple, and has been on my mind a little bit. 

They say that after a while of dating and being together you start to ween out of the honeymoon stage and start to have a simple relationship with one another. But we have been dating for almost a year now, next month, and I feel like that stage hasn't ended for me yet, though it does seem to have with him.

I go to school about 2 hours away from him, so we only see eachother now and again on weekends. But when we are together, I tend to love on him all day. I watch him play games, cuddle, watch movies/shows with him. Even when we hang out with his friends or are in public, I tend to want to hold his hand and give him kisses.

He on the other hand is of course past this. He has said that he both likes and dislike my lovey-doveiness. Sometimes he loves it because he feels important/special/wanted. Othertimes it is kind of annoying or clingy.

But I'm just not sure what to do about it. I always want to show him how much I love him and how happy he makes me, but I also don't want to be a smothering gf.

I told her many times that I usually don't like talking on my phone that much but she kept calling me two to three times a day. So one day she couldn't hear me, no idea why. I tried sending voicemails and other stuff but it seemed like my microphone was broken and i told her that. Later that day I just tried restarting my phone and everything worked again, thing is, I never told her that. I lied to her and said something about a repair that would cost 60€ and I didn't want to spend my money for that. Fast forward a few weeks, She asked me out on a date. I've never seen her as a potential girlfriend but decided to meet her anyways just so see how it goes. So the date was going meh, and when she went to see the toilet I wrote my friend a message that he should call me about an importent appointment I forgot to get myself out of this date a quickly as possible. She came back and two minutes later I recieved the call from my friend. Afte I exchanged some words with my friend, I realized what I just did. The girl looked at me as if I just killed somebody. At this point, I knew there was no going back. I lied to her because I didn't want to spend time talking to her and she knew that now too. She looked pretty angry, ran out of the restaurant and I haven't heard anything from her since. Needlesly to say, I'm not going to see her again.

I asked her about it a couple of months ago, and she said she just didn't want to get in any trouble. 

At the time, this was somewhat legitimate because she was here on an H-4 visa (her dad is here on an H-1 visa and her status is dependent on him). However, about a month ago, she received her green card. I asked her why she couldn't come in with me to pick out our drinks now and she still says the same thing. 

Naturally, I point out that we would be in the same amount of trouble if we got caught, which we wouldn't anyways since we've been buying consistently for well over a year from this guy.

POST: Me and my gf met on tinder and have been dating for ~6 months now. The start of the relationship was fun, and best of all was the sex. We both loved it. She was a lot more experienced than I am, she has slept with 8 people where I have only slept with 2 (current gf included) but that was never an issue.

About 2 months into the relationship we both moved cities for university, coincidentally we had both been accepted by the same one and now live just minutes away from eachother, as opposed to the 45 minute drive before hand. But then the relationship changed - she started getting more jealous, we argued a lot and it seemed like we were going to lose eachother but we both stuck through it. 

We had to start searching for a house in the private sector rather than in University accommodation for second and third year study, and I felt like it would be sensible to get separate houses with friends just to be safe, as we are in a new relationship and this was my first 'real' relationship, but when I told her she took it as an offence, like I was trying to get away from her. It took me a while to reason with her, and though she still doesn't agree with me, she is accepting of my decision.

We've been going steady for a month or two now without arguing but the relationship is different, there's no spark. We seem to just sit and watch tv, and the sex is down to about once or twice a fortnight. I know that can be classed as the honeymoon stage passing but the sex just feels forced. Like we only do it because we haven't in a while. I have tried a few times to mention that I would like to have more sex but she doesn't seem as enthusiastic. Am I a bad person for saying this?

Hey /relationships,

So I met this girl at OSU earlier this year, and we both fell deeply in love.  This was my first real relationship, and I was smitten completely - I fell hard for her, and she did the same for me.  Now, at around 7 days, she said I love you, and I returned it, for I really thought that I felt that way.  Around 2 months in, we were talking about marriage and getting engaged, and formulating plans together for the future.  

Now here is the issue.  I no longer am sure about getting engaged or married.  I definitely still want to be with her, but I am finally coming to my senses and realizing that 6 months is way, way, Way too soon to get engaged, and that I want to know her for a few years before I am comfortable with being married.  We're just beginning to get to know each other and commit to each other for life right now would just be laying the grounds for a potentially unhappy and unsuccessful marriage.

With all of that being said, I know the general consensus will just be to talk about it, and keep both parties on the same page regarding the relationship, and this is what I would do, if I knew that she wouldn't freak out completely.  She has deep abandonment issues and trust issues which we have been working through together, and I know she would view this as a violation of her trust and love.  I've always assumed honesty is the best policy, but I'm just not sure about what to do in this circumstance.

TITLE: My (28/f) girlfriend opened up to me about her past and now I (31/m) feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go and stop judging her. Any advice is appreciated.

POST: An amazing woman entered my life a few months ago. We hit it off right away and have been discovering new facets to our chemistry ever since. It's been mind-blowingly great in just about every way. She is absolutely crazy about me, and I felt the same about her until she recently opened up to me about her past. She told me that she's been with tons of guys, saying that it was often an 'obligation' for having been taken out on a couple dates, that she could easily separate the emotional and physical aspects of sex.

I really feel that I've lost a great deal of respect for her, and I don't fully understand why. I've always associated such feelings with jealousy, insecurity, or mistrust, but this doesn't feel like that to me. It just feels like I think less of her. I want so badly to let it go. She's absolutely incredible in so many ways that are important to me. 

My brain tells me that feeling this way is immature, stupid, and extremely unfair to her. I have a past too. I have no right to expect anything of her before we met. But her past is of the type that I have specifically avoided in my own life, generally feeling that it was a matter of self-respect. I've always thought it was important to reserve sex for meaningful relationships. 

Am I being overly judgmental? Is any part of what I'm feeling rational?

How do I forgive her past? Maybe forgive isn't the right word, because I don't necessarily think she's done anything wrong. But how do I let it go?

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend opened up to me about her past and now I feel like I've lost respect for her. I want to let it go and stop judging her. Any advice is appreciated.,  The best relationship of my life fell into my lap and my inability to get over her past is threatening to ruin it.

POST: Everything was fantastic before she left, like I literally had one of the best times of my life with her early this week. 

The night before she left I asked her if were exclusive, and she asked if I was worried she was going to cheat on the trip. I played it as calm as possible ""a girl is going to do what she's going to do,  I can't stop you either way... but I like you and.. blah blah blah..."" Although it wasn't fully aired out, the cuddling/kissing combined with ""just trust me baby I'm not gonna hurt you..."" talk made me feel like we were. 

IDK, I thought we were cool We had sex since I asked her that...  then she went out of town and I haven't heard from her since day one. 

Like she sent me a trivial  text, I responded 5 minutes later, then didn't get anything else for over 24 hours, when I texted her again... a ""what'sup, having fun"".

No response, going on three days now since I last heard from her Tuesday morning.

I don't text her again right? It would be too clingy? Is it time to start assuming the worse?  

Would a ""are you okay...?"" kind of text leaning on I'm worried for her safety be a good thing to try?

TITLE: [PA] Serving an ""underager"" as a Bartender

POST: I'm a bartender at a restaurant/bar which can get pretty busy on friday night.  So, we have a bouncer who cards everyone at the door.  As he is the one in charge of this process, I'm assuming, probably incorrectly, that he assumes liability for anyone allowed in underage. This carding includes looking at the IDs as well as swiping.  PA IDs, or so I'm told, are generally difficult to fake so if he gives them the okay, I don't usually double check.  

Apparently, two girls came in one Friday night and the one was underage.  We only discovered this because the girl's father came in and was complaining that she got served because she's only 20.  Assuming he reports this, what kind of legal trouble could I be looking at?

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my (friends with benefits?) [18 F] confused.

POST: So let me start off by saying I've been ""seeing"" this girl for about two weeks. She's sweet, a total tomboy, and she's real cool. Now normally I fall head over heels for girls, but after our first date she made it clear she wasn't necessarily looking to date. Fine by me, I'm in a phase of my life where I'm fine without a girlfriend, but the problem is I'm a virgin and plan to stay so (until I find someone I love enough to give it away). That makes hookups difficult. This girl has slept over on weekends, and I've gone out drinking with her friends, it's a good time, but I'm realizing now that I kind of want a relationship. It doesn't have to be with her, but I care about her, and she had one of those drunk spill all moments the other night. She basically said that she cares about me way too much and wants a relationship but is scared and so she'll never date me. She said however she would date me if we eventually had sex. This scared the crap out of me. If you like me, date me because you like me, not because you want my sex. It's so confusing.

On top of this, there are two girls who I know for a fact would love for me to ask them out. I could do this as I don't have any immediate attachments to the girl I'm fwb'ing with (if you can call it that), and they're both definitely looking for a relationship. It's strange because I usually fall head over heels for the girls I'm seeing very quickly, but this time it's been different. I'm just really confused. I think I'm going through a phase or something. Thanks guys. Appreciate help in advance.

TITLE: Interested in my ex's good friend

POST: I dated a girl who we'll call Jane for 8 months and was very in love with her. To make a long story short, over the summer we broke up and I was devastated but, as is part of life, I had to move on. So I started talking to other people and the one person in specific I started talking to was her friend - let's call her Nicole. So Nicole and I got to talking a lot and rather quickly I became really interested in her. So one day, I invited her over to my house thinking that we would just hang out as friends because that's all I really thought of it but things started getting pretty flirty. I brought attention to a vodka bottle I had in the cabinet twice not for the purpose of convincing her to drink some with me but just pointing it out. The second time she suggest we have some so we did. We both got a bit tipsy and nearly kissed but instead both decided that on account of Jane that would not be a good idea for either of us because I admittedly still had feelings for Jane. Despite this decision, I continued flirting with Nicole and she continued flirting with me. We started hanging out a lot and cuddling and doing essentially anything but actually kissing. Again, to make a long story short, over the past few months we've hung out a lot and flirted a lot and cuddled but we keep getting stopped by something. Despite knowing that this thing is Jane I decided to ask Nicole today. So we went for a walk and talked and she said that if it were not for Jane she would definitely be interested in me but that she can't do that to Jane. I want to have something more than a friendship with Nicole but because of my relationship with Jane which, to restate, she ended Nicole doesn't see that happening. I basically want to know if there is anything I could do to convince Nicole otherwise.

TITLE: [25/F] getting married, bridesmaid [25/F] won't get back to me!

POST: Hello,

So I [25/F] am getting married in about 2 months. I had planned to have 3 bridesmaids and a maid of honor. However, one of my bridesmaids [25/F] has been really out of the loop (not answering calls/texts/emails/fb messages). This was also the case when I was trying to ask her to be a bridesmaid (a process which took months to get in touch with her!). My fiancé and I recently moved to another state, so most of our people from our wedding party are from out of town (which I understand limits what they can do to help); however, all my bridal party have gotten matching dresses (of different shades of blue) and she still hasn't even responded to any of their messages either. She always comes up with lame excuses (her phone broke/ she got a new computer- which SHE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO CHECK FB MESSAGES AND EMAILS!). 

She has been a very close friend since we were young (since 11 years old!). I love her to death and we have always had the kind of relationship were we don't need to talk or hang out every weekend to be able to maintain our friendship (we have always been there for any crisis and told each other everything even after months of not talking). I feel like she is really dropping the ball on this tough… It's not like I'm asking her to help with ANY PREPARATIONS for the wedding, just get ANY dress that is blue... I would even help financially but she doesn't respond to ANYTHING.

I have thought about asking her to step down because I find it really rude of her BUT HOW if I can't even get in touch with her?! I am also scared about messing up the friendship… but… I think she already has.

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [18F] recently found out her last boyfriend was cheating on her the entire time. I feel like a consolation suddenly.

POST: So my better half recently found her last boyfriend was cheating on her. This guy broke up with her by text and flaked on her constantly for 75% of the relationship (from what she told me) and she was suspicious of cheating the whole time. 

Since they broke up (January or so) he completely ignores her unless he asks for nudes/tries to hook up. 

But even so while they were dating she was desperate for his attention and validation. She recognized what she was doing sticking around was not healthy but she did it anyway. Really liked the guy. That's important information.

Anyway, so when she found out the other day that for the entire time he was seeing other people she got really down. Think it's entirely her fault. I'm trying to be supportive; being cheated on sucks. I've been telling her she's not to blame at all, etc etc. 

I've wondered why she picks up his calls when he tries to ""apologize"" (from what she told me he says it wasn't that big of a deal and she should give him a second chance) and I've asked her why she doesn't just delete him. She says she does but hours later she unblocks him or whatever. 

But what really *really* gets me is that he said he wants to redo last year and treat her right. She allegedly shoots him down and says she moved on to better things but it is driving me up the got-damn wall knowing he's trying to get her back under his thumb again.

Tell him that I want to have a serious conversation about our future in general, and marriage (children, our own families), our values (religion, abortion, homosexuality), our finances (current and potential future), and our future(what happens if only one of us gets the job, what happens if neither of us get the job, can we survive the two year separation that's left, etc). 

2. Give him a few days warning so he has time to think about it. 

3. Sit down and have the conversation at home, cuddled on the couch, and with a beer each (only one each so we don't get drunk) and quiet music. 

However, are there any topics, questions, comments, or attitude to avoid (that is not blatantly obvious)? Or, are there any additional topics,questions we must go over?

TL;DR:",  I need to have a serious conversation with my boyfriend about marriage and our future. What topics/comments/things to avoid at all costs?,  LDR boyfriend and I need to have a serious conversation about marriage. What are the things I must avoid/ask?

TITLE: ex took me for granted, is now 'changing', and wants me back. Help?!

POST: My boyfriend (22) and I (22) had been dating for almost 4 years. There was a short breakup in there about 11 months ago in the Spring because I was unhappy/didn't feel appreciated/could no longer put up with his lengthy list of bad habits and his attitude. After that breakup he 'changed'. He did everything the way I pictured a relationship should be. So we got back together a few weeks later.

Fast forward to the Fall: He is back to his old habits but worse. But there are still good times so I ignore them. And our relationship continues. But come Winter, we just are not happy. So we break up about a week ago.

And then it all happens again. He 'changes'. He say's most of the change is because his doctor told him he needs to shape up, and he blamed most of our problem on the fact that he'd gotten fat and self conscious about that. Now he's running, and working out, and eating well, and stopping smoking, and is being more exciting and seems happier, and listening to me, and we have actual communication, and he shows affection, and sex (yes, we're broken up, I know it's bad and confusing), and he deleted his video games, and stopped sitting on reddit for endless hours(no offense, reddit). All the things that weren't there before.

He's doing what he did last time that worked to get me back last time again, but with much greater effort and what I think is more sincerity. 

I don't want to be a fool. It is nice spending time with him, now that everything is what I wanted in a relationship. But with us, it seems like we're better a bf/gf when we are broken up. I am really at a loss as to what to do. I don't want to not spend time with him. But I don't want to jump right back into it and repeat the cycle. Did he change, and is that change enough to make us work, or is this a failing relationship which is bound to be prolonged? Please, may I have some advice? I don't know what I want.

TL;DR:","  ex boyfriend took me for granted after a messy break up, is now working hard to make things work again. Is this enough to make us work or is this a doomed relationship?","  Boy was a bad boyfriend, we broke up, Boy is now a good boyfriend, this happened once before, I don't know what to do!!eeek."

TITLE: (21f)Accidentally spilled out a drunken 'I think I love you' to my new boyfriend (21m). He handled it better than I did.

POST: My boyfriend and I just started dating a few days ago. He asked me out nye (super romantically, it was pretty adorable tbh)
We only recently met (2 months ago) but have ended up very close. I'm a very emotional person and he's very reserved and I'm cool with that. While super drunk last night in a total lapse of judgement I blurted out 'I think I love you' in kind of a half joking way (because obviously we still aren't THAT close being we've really just met) but it definitely caught him off guard and made him feel super uncomfortable. Being drunk I immediately went into 'holy shit I'm sorry wow that was stupid I'm an idiot' mode and got pretty upset, it's the first time I've gotten that way around him and It kind of spiraled into me feeling even more shitty about making him uncomfortable which in turn made him feel worse. He's an absolute sweetheart and was very honest with me, telling me he was uncomfortable with it but he's not thoroughly turned off from the fact I said it, just that he can't say it back. He hasn't had much relationship experience and I do know he does like me, but I also know that now I've compromised my calm and collected attitude and made myself look vulnerable, which leaves me with a lingering anxiety about how he's feeling and what he may not be saying. 

Everything is fine this morning, he kissed me goodbye and I went off to work and I'm going back to see him tonight, but I feel that I've thoroughly fucked everything up and can't really go back from this. Is this feeling in the pit of my stomach valid or am I just overreacting?

TL;DR:","  Accidentally drunkenly said I think I love you to my new boyfriend, he handled it better than I did and I feel like I've compromised my cool and collected attitude which is causing anxiety for me.","  blurt out the L word drunk to brand new boyfriend who obviously doesn't reciprocate.

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my dating person [24 M] of ~5 months, wondering how to / if I can even ask him to delete nude vid I sent him

POST: Started dating one of my closest guy friends (known him since I was 5 years old) on in May this year. We hit it off great and generally we are happy together. He asked me for exclusivity, and I gave it. He hasn't directly asked me to be his girlfriend though, so I assume that we're just dating, exclusively.

I'm not the type to post a lot of pics of myself anywhere. It's a personal thing that I dislike doing. But he often asks for them. I usually just decline and tell him that if he wants to see me, I'll hang out with him in person/online (Skype and stuff). 

Then one day I got curious and made a < 30 second vid of me naked (just me showing off my body and playing with my tits/ass). I sent it to him and he really liked it. Mind you, I hesitated for several hours before sending that video. After a few days though, I began to realize why I never did those things in the past. I regret sending him it and ***I just want to have him delete the video for good, right away!***

I don't know how to do this. I don't even know if it's fair for me to. I just regret it so much (and needless to say, I will never do anything like this ever again).

TL;DR:",  Sent a nude video of myself to my guy friend. He really liked it and I want him to delete it for good. How do I go about asking him to do this?,  I want him to erase all existence of a nude vid I sent him. How can I do this without causing any friction between us? CAN I even do this?

TITLE: I [34M] am going to visit my friend [32F] in another state in a few weeks. There could be relationship potential, but when should I say something?

POST: So I'm going to visit a friend of mine in another state in a little over a month. We've been friends for over ten years and we've always gotten along really well. She's smart and she's attractive, we know how to make each other laugh and we have a lot in common. I think that there could be more than just a friendship here, there could be relationship potential.

A little background: This girl and I have known each other since college. She used to date one of my best friends, but we've known each other since before that relationship and have kept in touch since then. We drifted apart for a couple of years after they broke up but have gotten back in touch and have grown closer as friends over the last couple of years. I would have said something to her sooner, but I was in another relationship anyway until about two years ago and until know I've been reluctant to pursue someone my friend had dated.

The question is, when is the best time to bring this up? The tickets are purchased and I'll make the trip regardless. I have no doubt that it will be a fun visit either way. Should I say something before I get on the plane to go visit? Should I wait until I get there and can ask her in person? (Should I make a drunken pass and see how she reacts? :-P ) Help me figure out what to do!

TL;DR:",  Going to visit my friend in another state in a few weeks. There could be relationship potential but when should I say something?,  Going to visit a long time friend out of state. How and when do I tell her I'm interested in a relationship?

TITLE: I [21m] recently found out my semi-LDR girlfriend [19F] of a year has depression. She has started acting cold and uncaring when we are apart.

POST: Not really sure what advice im looking for.... am I overreacting? should i be worried she is fed up?  

Girlfriend is in college during the week and we only see each other on weekends when she is back home. About 3/4 weeks ago she was not answering my texts or just being very aloof with me. When we met up at the weekend she eventually admitted that she has had depression before and is going through it again so she wanted to break up because in the past she has treated her boyfriends like shit during these periods and didn't want to do that to me. I said no, thanked her for telling me what was happening and then said we would get through this rough patch.  

So since then she has gone from texting me and talking throughout the day to maybe getting a text or two in reply to something I sent during the day. I know this sounds stupid but we have ended almost all of our texts for the past year with an ""x"" but she is even rarely doing that now. She is even purposefully ignoring texts as I get the read notification and if i get a reply it can be hours later.  

One part I can't understand is, when we are together at weekends things seem almost normal as she seems happy to see me, we hang out, sleep together etc.  
We even talk about possibly moving out together in the summer.  

I know she told me she would be rough to deal with during this time but whenever I have asked whats up she says everything is fine. But I know during the times she is ignoring me she is actively talking to people on facebook/text etc.  

Apologies about the wall of text but this whole new behavior is driving me insane! And I don't know if Im worrying over nothing

TL;DR:",  Found out my semi-LDR girlfriend has depression and has been acting cold and uncaring when we are apart. She has started to ignore me and talk to others on facebook/text etc. Should I be worried?,  Girfriend seems to care about me less (even seems annoyed by me) when we are apart since depression diagnoses but acts almost her usual self when we are together.

TITLE: Reddit, Forrest needs your help identifying a genetic disease.  Calling those with superb internet skills and a passion for cute things. Pics inside.

POST: Four weeks ago, a mouse I adopted had six babies.  All the babies looked like [wrinkly pink jelly beans]  Nothing was amiss.  

Day 6 or so, we thought it was safe to [begin handling the babies]  All babies looked fit and healthy and [were all the same size]  It appeared as though they were having trouble moving their hind legs, but I chocked that up to them just learning to walk.  I noticed it especially in the dark grey-brown ones, but in hindsight, maybe I had been handling the same mouse every time thinking that they were different.  The only female was the white one, the rest were males, which made it even harder to differentiate between the three ones of the same color.

Once they really started growing hair and we handled them for hours at a time, we noticed [this guy]  Do you see anything odd about him?  How about if we [compare him to his brother]  At first we thought he was paralyzed, but it soon became clear that was not the case.  He could move his tail and his hind legs freely, but he didn't do it often.  When he did decide to move his legs, the movements were stiff.  He could curl his toes.  He used his whole leg like a flipper to push himself along the table.  We named him Forrest, after Forrest Gump, because he is a determined bugger who can't walk or do any mouse things as well as his brothers.  

Now, he is one third the size of his family.  He developed slower than the others after day 12; his eyes opened about 4 days later, he took the longest to wean, and he is the least adventurous (understandably). 

As with most random mouse pregnancies, there is a chance of the litter being a result of inbreeding.  His body size makes me think it's not an environmental or physical cause, which leads me to genetic disease.  Do his symptoms sound like anything you know about?  My google-fu has failed me, but I am only a trainee.  Thus, Forrest and I turn to you for help.

TL;DR:","  A mouse I adopted had six babies, all of which looked healthy.  Turns out he has a genetic disease that is affecting his physical and mental development.

TITLE: I feel like I'm going to be trapped in retail. Am I a failure?

POST: I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.

I'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.

I just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to). I just feel like a failure who doesn't know what to do.

TITLE: I [19M] am having trouble dealing with my girlfriends [19F] helicopter parents and could really use some advice.

POST: So we are both college freshman and have a fantastic relationship (almost half a year in). But the only problem I have found in our relationship is her parents. College to me seems like when we become more independent and on our own. For me that is for sure the case and I love it. But **her parents are literally in everything she does**. She calls them and tells them about every class and assignment and then they usually and way to mean and tell her to study harder and do better. She sends them assignments to look over before submission. They shove religion down her throat when she doesn't want to be part of it. For Valentines day they send a few candies and the job listings section from a paper...

**They treat her like a child and make me feel like I am dating a child.**

^ That is pretty much the main problem. I feel like I am becoming an adult and moving to the next stage and then there is her parents pretty much babying her through everything. **I know for a fact if we want to move into together in a couple years it will be a matter of asking for their permission rather than ""We decided to move in"" which is insane to me.** An important factor I think is that they are rather well off and pay for all her things, including all college expenses. She has never had a job. I am from a poor family and worked my way here which makes me feel like we are different somehow. Any advice could help me so much, thank you.

POST: I know this is probably an irrational worry/concern because aside from this ""little"" thing, we have a great relationship. 

Somewhat early on in the relationship I found out from old facebook posts/albums that my SO had a pet name for his ex with whom he had an LDR for about half of the time they spent as a couple (about two years). He used to call her his ""kitty"". I love nicknames and terms of endearment like this. It makes me feel special and close to another person when they call me something other than my given name. My SO and I have been together for three years but he's never even tried calling me anything other than my name. I've already told him how I feel about pet names but still, nothing. I've even tried calling him silly or cute names but nothing has ever really stuck. I'm at the point where I don't really want to force it because I feel like stuff like that should come naturally. Which makes the whole ex-pet-name thing something that's bothered me for the longest time. He doesn't know that I know (because at this point I feel like it would be creepy to bring it up). Also, the name ""kitty"" really gets me because he loves cats. (not surprising, I know) So much so that every time that he sees one he'll say ""kitty"" in almost a baby-talk cutesy voice. 

So I guess I'm feeling like I'm not as special/close/precious to him as his ex was just because he doesn't have a pet name for me. I don't know if it's even worth talking about with him because as I said, everything else is great and it's not that I don't feel loved... my scumbag brain just won't leave me alone about it :(

TITLE: How can I keep my parents' cigarette smoke off of me on my way to a college scholarship day, where I will be interviewed?

POST: This Saturday (Feb. 8) my parents and I will be driving to the college that I will be attending this fall, which is about an hour and a half drive from home, give or take. My parents have been smokers for my whole life, so I am pretty desensitized to the smell, but many instructors and just random bystanders have commented about the scent on my person. This will not make a good impression on the committee (at least I think it is a committee. either way, it will be noticeable). I tried to ask very nicely if at least my mom would consider not smoking, but she kind of laughed at me and made a bunch of rude, sarcastic comments about how it's not really that noticeable, and my character should be enough to win over the interviewers. 1. My personality is not the best, and I'm not too great at interviews and 2. If the competition is tough, I am pretty sure that it WILL go down to the first impression that is given, and the smell of cigarettes is NOT going to give a good impression, even if I apologized and that my parents were smokers.

Some suggestions that I have been given by instructors/counselors include: chewing cinnamon gum, packing my clothes and covering my hair until I get there (which I'm not too keen on, because I don't know where I would really change or anything like that), and putting cooking vanilla in the car? I'm not too sure about that one. Will any of these work? Other suggestions are very welcome.

POST: I've just come out of a 4 year relationships a month later set up a date with a girl I've had previous dates with. Our previous dates were always a bit awkward because we were both nervous and I've always found it hard to talk to the opposite sex (so lots of silence).

So I began talking to her again last week and I decided not to beat around the bush and asked if she wanted to catch up for coffee to which she agreed. So the beginning of the date kind of started awkward i found her eyes kept moving around the room and wouldn't keep eye contact for long, there were moments of short awkward pauses like before, she asked me questions about my family and about other things but I felt I was asking her more questions. The second half i felt we became more comfortable she kept moving her hair behind her ear, would smile more and kept eye contact more and we ended up talking straight for just over an hour. But after the date was over I feel disconnected or not reaching the level of intimacy that I feel i should've.

I'm not sure if because of my low self esteem/ confidence of a bad breakup I'm overthinking or over expecting things or seeing shyness as being bored or uninterested, Or if shes sending me hints she wants to just be friends.

Also is it appropriate to send the night of the date a ""I had a great time, we should catch up again soon"" message?

POST: I moved over here for work, into a house with 4 people already living there - The ad for the room said: Professionals only.

Another guy [36m] from Romania lives in the house, and wanted his wife and 3 kids to get into the house.

Our landlord [50m] Egyptian, accepted it as a way of 'helping his family over here', which we all said was OK.

Now it turns out, they plan on staying in the house until ATLEAST next summer - and we all pay the same rent and share bills (approx 1300$ a month)

To make it even worse, his 3 kids [1/3/4] are ALWAYS awake until midnight, sometimes later, and they are so noisy it wakes me up all the time throughout my sleep, and causes too big of an exhaustion to go to work.

Our landlord put the father on the council papers and contract, and since we're too many living in the house, I'm not able to get on the contract.

What would the best solution be to actually get his kids to shut it this late?

POST: How do you break up with someone if they are the only person you've been close to in the past 4 years, if they have a shit family or no place to really call home? I am afraid I will ruin him. I can't think of life without him yet I feel we are toxic to each other.

My parents do not approve of him, say he brings nothing to the table for me and that I am not responsible for his life. It has put so much strain on our relationship throughout the years and I have found myself exhausted. Their strict rules have also been extremely troublesome/stressful for us and I am often pushed to my limits in order to maintain a balanced relationship between family and bf but more often than not one of them suffers.

I do not know if I'm trying to make things work between us because I feel guilty and responsible for him, or if I'm just afraid of what will happen if I let him go, or if we are actually meant to stay together and work through these hard times. Things have escalated in the past few weeks and this fate has become more imminent than ever. His unstable living situation is putting so much stress on the both of us. We have dealt with distance for the past 3 years horribly. I play a division 1 sport in college and have a ridiculous schedule while he has not been able to hold down a job for more than two months because of unfortunate variables relating to his shitty living situation. It will be a huge pivoting point in both of our lives if things end but I feel as if we are stuck in some awful loop of shitty circumstance and I do not know how to get out of it.

I'm sorry if this sounds pathetic this is the first time I've tried writing this. I really have no one to talk to and am in desperate need of advice. 

I am at my wits end. He is so important to me and I just want to do what will be best for both of us in the end.

POST: I will try to be brief.
We met, we went out 2-3 times, great chemistry but at time I could feel she would give me mixed signals. I held back, eventually (after 4 dates) asked her to dinner to my place while I made it obvious what my intentions were... she told me about BF... I could see it coming but didnt blame her for it, since our first few dates could have been interpreted as friendly ones (.. as if she didnt know what was going on)... I told her I respect that and backed off. She said shes struggling with it so naturally I have kept myself around, but have not been looking for her, yet we text a couple times a week, and have hung out a few times after that...

Current situation is

- she knows i like her
- I know she likes me
- last time we hung out and i dropped her off she sent a message asking if shes a bad person for wanting to kiss me (i just avoided answering that and said something else related to the night, even though i wanted to say more)
- I am still assuming shes still with the guy. Havent texted or seen her since...

at what point would it be reasonable for me to put pressure on her again? do I just let it run its course and fucking suck it up as long as I can, do I wait for another situation where she clearly wants to be with me, and act on it?

I like this chick, and I feel that if she cheats on her bf with me, I will always have that in the back of my mind if I got in a relationship with her.... but at the same time, I dont wanna wait around indefinitely

TL;DR:","  I like this girl, she likes me, but she has a boyfriend of almost 3 years.

TITLE: 22(F) and 29(M) Casually seeing each other, but he keeps asking me to go on romantic dates?

POST: Hi Reddit, long time lurker, first time poster. Throwaway account. I am a 22 year-old female and he is a 29 year-old male. We have been casually seeing each other for about six weeks now.

We initially met through a friend at a bar, and things were awkward at first, but we ended up going for a late meal and hitting it off. After we met we began texting quite frequently (maybe once a day) and went on a few dates. We first slept with each other on the third date and it was great. Since then, we have gone on a few dates, that almost always end with us sleeping together. I consider all of this to be casual and we have never discussed a relationship or anything more. 
But here is my issue: he keeps asking me to go on all of these really nice, fancy dinner dates. I do enjoy his company but I do not want to pursue anything more than what we currently have going. He is attractive, generous, and sweet; but we do not seem to have an engaging connection and I got out of a very long and intense relationship at the beginning of the year (so I want some time to be single), among other reasons.
My question is: when would it be an appropriate time for me to bring up my concerns? He invited me to go on a date this week. Should I go and tell him there? Or should I decline and tell him right away that I think these dates are a bit much for our given situation? My personal philosophy has always been don't discuss being serious unless the other person brings it up. He has not brought it up. I guess my biggest concern is that he pays for our dates (I try to pay for my half or my drinks and he never lets me) and it seems unfair if I don't want to be official in the end. He is a great guy and I would like to continue seeing him without any strings attached.

TITLE: I'm [32 M] with a great [30 F] girl and I want to settle down but never stay satisfied with relationships more than a year or two

POST: My past three relationships have all been about 2 years, and I've ended all of them because of a combination of problems and me losing interest. 

The current girl I'm with has mostly everything I would want in a relationship - but I'm feeling myself starting to lose interest anyway. She does have a fairly bad jealousy problem, but some of it is warranted and I feel that everyone has to have some personal defects which should be forgiven.

One factor which I think contributes to feeling unsatisfied is that I tend to get what my friend calls a ""wandering eye."" Even though I'm happy with my gf I can't help noticing other girls around and being drawn to them, even catching myself flirting at times. A lot of it is sexual attraction and desire - it seems horrible but after being with my gf almost a year I'm less interested in sex and occasionally get a rush of excitement when I notice another girl showing interest in me. 

I could just date indefinitely but I do want to settle down and have kids. I just always get the feeling that I can't stay satisfied with my relationships, and if I'm getting this restlessness after only a year or two I can't imagine how it would be over the rest of my lifetime. 

An obvious answer would be to decide which is more important, dating different people or settling down, and then have the self control to stick to the decision. It's just that long term I *want* to settle down, but I can never escape the feeling of wanting to pursue other girls. A few years back I told someone older this and they said ""you must not be ready,"" but I can't help feeling like this isn't going away, and I really would like to start a family.

TITLE: [Oklahoma] Contract Dispute

POST: I'll try to keep it short for you all. This is in Oklahoma.

Before we started building we agreed upon the terms and signed two contracts. We signed a Construction Agreement and Specification Agreement. The first one lines out the overall terms of the contract, the second one lines out the specifications that the home is to be built to (construction materials, quality, etc). Both of these documents have a total sales price listed on them, however the price is different on each one. The Construction Agreement has the price listed at $200K, which is $6K higher than the price that is listed on the Spec Agreement.

The main dispute we are having is over a septic system. When we entered into the agreement we agreed that I was going to install the septic myself and save us $6K. However after construction started we had a hiccup with our guy and we ended up letting the builder install it for us.

On the Spec Agreement (the one with the lower price) he actually has in there that one of the things he agrees to is to install a septic tank, even though when the contract was signed he wasn't going to do that. This Spec Agreement says the sales price of the home with him installing septic is $194K.

When I saw the discrepancy in prices I thought he'd just forgotten to take the $6K off of one contract, but not the other. When I talked to him about it he said it was a typo and the price on the Master Agreement (the higher price) is the correct price and the price on the Spec Agreement is a typo, plain and simple.
What he is trying to do now is to charge us the higher price ($200K) plus an extra $6K for installing the septic. I'm not trying to get anything for free here, I'm just wanting to be fair.

TL;DR:","  Contract says the sales price of the home is $194K, but the Spec Agreement lists a higher price of $200K. What is going on here? Is there anything I can do?",  The Master Agreement has the price as $200K without a septic tank. The Spec Agreement has the price at $194K and says he is to install a septic tank included in that price.

I knew the owner of the club, and some of the guards, so I told a guard that I thought he might be dealing drugs in the bathrooms to get him thrown out. Little did I know that he was selling drugs in the bathrooms, and things get a bit out of hand.

The guards check it out, and realize that he is selling drugs, so they try to stop him. He punches one guard and locks himself in one of the stalls (and even though he is in the bathroom he does not think of flushing the drugs).

The police comes and while arresting him, he breaks one of their noses. He was charged and convicted of aggravated assault, assaulting a public official, resisting arrest, selling cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and weed.

To make matters worse, it seems that he has some sort of autism. He'll rock back and forth in his seat during class which is both visually (he sits in the front) and audibly distracting (the seats creak).

The cherry on the cake, however, is that for long stretches of class he will breathe exclusively through his mouth. I have no idea whether this is a health-related issue or a psychological thing, but his breathing is loud enough to make it hard to hear the (albeit soft-spoken) professor.

Recently after I looked back on what brought me here and why my body reacts the way I do its pretty clear. Any immediate bout of anger instantly turns to sadness and tears involuntarily.

TL;DR:","  After childhood environment of distrust, anger and confrontation my body turns anger into sadness involuntarily whenever I get angry. What horrible decisions does your mind make for you that you can't control?",  I can be as serious as I want and tears will start flowing and my chest will start convulsing from sniffing while I'm talking because my anger involuntarily turns to sadness.

POST: For the first couple weeks I was so depressed I could only sleep 1-4 hrs a day and couldn't stop overthinking things. Now for the past couple days I've been sleeping okay and have started thinking forwards. I still miss her, am a bit sad, and have dreams of her almost every day. Though the majority of the day now I'm fine.

I've also been really horny lately as I haven't done it for a month now. Am thinking of getting an escort. I was looking to get into a one nighter or hookup for the past week but have had no luck. No matches on Tinder really brought down my self-esteem too though I think I'm above average looking. Feeling stressed out, should I get an escort for a night or will it be a huge mistake?

TITLE: 11 years since my heart transplant, and i'm tired of medication's side effects

POST: When I had my heart transplant i was 12. I remember I was always tired and i can't breath properly so my mother took me to the ospital. We found out that my heart was larger than normal, they put me on transplant list and 3 weeks later there was an heart available for me.
Now I'm 23 and I almost spent the majority of my life with a new heart. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes i feel like it's an heavy bag on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel guilty, because when i was sick i prayed for a new heart (and it means that i prayed that a child would die to take me alive).
Sometimes I just feel ""normal"" and then reality comes back and hit me in my face with a new complication (my medication take me alive but they have a lot of side effects)
I don't plan my life, I just live it day by day, knowing that one of this days my doctors can tell me some bad news.

TITLE: [28/f] How do I become relationship-type and more feminine?

POST: I don't think I'm relationship-type.  I'm also insecure about my level of femininity.  
Men that I meet (work/socially) are hardly ever single.  The ones who are and that I get to know, I almost always develop a crush, but try so hard to hide it that they just end up becoming a good friend of mine.  They usually make it clear that they are attracted to me, but I disregard it.  I make it so easy to be comfortable with, the start sharing secrets and life stories and I do the same.  And that's where I know I screw up.  I also think I am headstrong, brazen and outspoken.  I'm very opinionated.  Also, I'm not as feminine (clothing) as other women.  I wear makeup, do cute hairstyles, wear lipstick, do my nails, wear jewelry, I have a perfume collection, etc.  But I do not wear skirts, dresses, or heels and open-toed shoes.  I think it is all beautiful, but I feel so alien like with it on.   I'm not a tomboy, I just don't like super girly attire.  I've had a male friend tell me that he and a lot of other men would date me if I was more feminine and submissive.  
Also, I've dated a couple of guys in the past who refuse to get serious with me.  They don't take me seriously romantically.  It seems like they'll try to hook up (9/10 times I'm not putting out) but not make anything exclusive.  I'm starting to feel real insecure.  Am I crazy and just don't know it?  Do men really only date super feminine women?  Am I too friendly?  How can I become more comfortable?  What do men like?  I'm at a age where I want to be in a relationship and fall in love, but I'm not sure if someone will ever accept me for me.  Sorry for the pity party.  I've been single for so long, I have to accept it is my fault.

TL;DR:","  I'm not relationship-type, I'm insecure about my level of femininity and don't like overly girly/sexy clothing.

TITLE: TIFU by visiting an ex

POST: This is a throwaway.

I dated a girl from January to August of last year.  We were pretty intimate, and had sex regularly that often ended with me finishing inside her. (It was mutually enjoyed, as she was on contraceptives.)  We had a pretty nasty breakup, and we didn't talk for awhile. 

In May of this year, she sent me a random text apologizing for things she said.  Feeling pretty frisky (and I suppose somewhat lonely), I offered to meet up and catch up with her.  I had no intention of rekindling our relationship, but hey, possible sex.  So we met at a bar, and I ended up going to her house.  We had sex in our normal fashion and proceeded to stay over for the night.  The next morning, we discussed our situation, and I confessed I didn't want to advance our relationship.  She somewhat reluctantly agreed.

I've been seeing a new girl for about a month now, and things are amazing!  We click on every level, she's gorgeous, and I find myself thinking about her constantly.  I don't think I've ever been so intrigued by somebody after such a short amount of time. I think I've found the perfect girl.  Except...

Today my ex called me.  She's pregnant.  She had secretly been off birth control for awhile, and she admitted that she thought a kid would be a way to ""keep us from fighting"" and to ""make us close again.""

Yep.  I think I fucked up.  I don't know what to do, or how this girl I'm seeing will take it.

TL;DR:","  Had sex with ex, confessed I didn't want anything serious, she secretly started on birth control and thought a kid would make us close again.  Now she's pregnant.  What do I do?",  Had a one night stand with exgirlfriend. She was crazy enough to stop taking contraceptives to purposefully have a kid with me without telling me.

POST: OK so first the background details. We've been together 4 years and live together. I truly love her and had planned on proposing to her later this year. 2 weeks ago she broke up with me over a silly fight. Said she need time to herself blah blah blah. I was devastated as I didn't see it coming. The weird part is she currently has been living with me after the breakup and will be here until next week which is when she will move out.

Now for the juicy part. Today i opened her laptop and she was signed into her email. I found numerous chat logs of her and a male co worker talking sexually and she even had sent him a nude photo. These texts go back to November. Normally i don't like to snoop around so I feel super guilty, but I had been having suspicions all along. I remember about 3 months back her entire attitude had changed and she became more distant which is around the time she had also mentioned that there was a guy in her office who liked her. This is the guys shes been chatting with.

Now, even though we are broken up I don't know what to do. Should I tell her I know? Even though it means exposing myself as having gone through her email? Should I just let it go? I feel like shit because this coworker of hers is married and basically I think instigated this whole ordeal for her to break up with me? Either way I'm at a loss.

TITLE: My girlfriend [21/F] is having a mental breakdown, how can I [21/M] help her?

POST: My girlfriend is going through a rough patch in her life right now. She is a university student doing an extremely hard subject. She has a lot of pressure on herself right now due to fear of letting her parents down.

Two weeks ago she started having obsessional thoughts about death and not existing. This prospect scared her to the point of having several panic attacks every day. She isn't religious and does not believe in an afterlife. Going to church seemed to help at first, but she is simply too inquisitive and scientific-minded to genuinely believe in an afterlife.

Now the panic attacks seem to have subsided but she is still having these thoughts. It usually manifests itself as an hour long period of not being able to function and then suddenly gathering up the energy to study for hours. She doesn't feel comfortable talking to her parents about this anymore because they tell her she is crazy. She has told me herself that the feeling is so unbearable she wishes that she just didn't exist sometimes.

I am encouraging her to get as much physical activity as possible and showing my support, but I feel clueless what else I can do to make her feel better? I try to avoid the subject of death now because nothing I say makes her feel any better; she counters anything I say with ""so what's the point, we are all going to disappear in the end."" When she isn't having these thoughts, she is fairly normal, but they happen often enough to affect her day-to-day functioning.

Going to the doctor isn't a realistic option right now for various reasons.

I proposed to my girlfriend this past March and we have done zero planning for it so far. I always wanted a big wedding until I came out and then the reason people get married completely changed for me. Now I just see it as I want to spend the rest of my life with her, not go into a lot of debt (neither of our parents are helping pay for it) and be stressed out, just so we can wait for the day to be over to move on with our lives. We're also saving for a down payment for a house. We were thinking of going to the courthouse and then throwing a party for everyone but that's  not good enough for her parents. because then aunts and uncles may feel excluded because we can't bring a million people to the courthouse and she's the only daughter so her dad wants to walk her down the aisle. I have three sisters, so my dad has been there done that. We were then thinking of a destination wedding but it would be really expensive for her parents to pay for her brothers to come (three younger brothers, still in college/hs) and her parents tried guilting her about her brothers not being there. Really, if we could go and get married today and move on from it and do nothing for it we would. But it seems unless we do wedding/reception everyone's going to be mad. 

Sorry for the long rant, but does anyone have advise on what to do? Has anyone done/seen the ""screw you we got married at the courthouse now moving on from this"" move? How has it worked out?

TITLE: Afraid of my (29f) husband (27m) leaving me at his cousins wedding.

POST: Okay well, not *leaving* leaving. I'm not very good with crowds- they make me incredibly anxious to the point where I'll have a panic attack. Knowing my husband will, at least, be there with me usually helps me feel more comfortable around crowds. I'll know a fair bit of people there, so it's not like I won't have anyone to talk to. It's just the sheer amount of people that makes me freak out. 

My husband, however, doesn't understand this. He enjoys going from one set of people he likes to another, and usually in ways that would a) be impossible for me to follow him or b) make it very creepy if I were to try. He always tells me I should just try opening up and talking to people without him, but with the amount (even over 20 people) will start to make me nervous. 

I don't want to hinder him in any way, and I don't want to be a ""ball and chain"" to him. But I also feel like he's a little bit obligated to me as his wife to reassure me if I'm scared or anxious. What should I do? Is there a way of explaining this rationally, or am I just being unreasonable.

I have narcolepsy. For the longest time, I felt that I had it under control. In school, my condition was misunderstood and I was ridiculed by my peers as well as my teachers. I overcame and found a nice job. I was laid off because of the recession and took up a job with a certain job with a certain game-related company. I tried my best to excel at my job, to the point where I became the Go-To-Guy for information on technical resolutions and policy matters. 

Today, I was demoted because my narcolepsy sometimes gets the better of me and I miss work. I cannot afford medical insurance nor the medicine to make it less of an issue ($500 for a month's supply). I was told that the ADA did not apply because attendance was a hard requirement for being a higher level agent. Our HR person told me that any job I get will have a requirement about attendance and that the ADA will never side with me. I am forced to assume an entry level position in a job I used to love. I feel as though my hard work will never pay off now, because my narcolepsy will also stop me from advancing and that ADA does not apply to me. 

I still feel like I'm being discriminated against but if what HR told me is true then I do believe that any career I take will be hampered by this condition, which cannot be cured. 

Please, tell me there are options. I feel as though I'm about to slip into a state of depression that I had left behind me so long ago. I don't want to be there. Please, tell me that there is hope.

The three of us took a summer class together and we were pretty much inseparable. Get back to main campus and ""Paul"" dates this other girl and ""Jane"" is upset and doesn't talk to him for a month. Flash forward a year to present, the three of us are still very close, hangout most weekends. Now I kinda like Paul now, but I've been ignoring that because he dated Jane, so I know I shouldn't and I casually date a few other guys. Well this past weekend Jane goes home (we're college students). So friday night I'm texting Paul and we discover we're both about to watch the same movie. He asks if I wanna watch it with him, and I know I should have said no, but I didn't. So we watch the movie at his place and then go to a friend's and everythings fine. He drives me home and then tells me he's had a crush on me since my freshman year, when he was dating Jane. I told him I liked him too, but we couldn't do anything because of Jane and we had a good thing going and we should keep that way. He agrees and apologizes several times that night and even the next day.  What I'm wondering is do I tell Jane, I tell her everything, but I think telling her may hurt more than help, since I kind of suspect she has some residual feelings. Also I think I hurt him because I feel like hanging out with him on a Friday night lead him to do this. Right now we're still texting and I think we're just ignoring it, but he left early for his class today instead of hanging out with us. I feel so guilty and selfish and I dont know how to make this better.

TL;DR:",  I think I may have fucked up a friendship by casually hanging out with my best friend who he apparently has feelings for since he dated my ex. Should I tell her or just ignore it?,"  My friend and I recently discovered we have feelings for each other, but our mutual friend (my best friend) dated him and now it's awkward and Idk if I should tell my best friend or not.

TITLE: TIFU by not wanting to be rude to a hairdresser

POST: This happened about an hour ago. I went to get a haircut as my hair was getting too long, I usually have it cut by the same girl but today I got booked in last minute and had someone new. She sat me down and asked what I wanted and since I've only really had one hairdresser for the past two years I've gotten used to not saying what I want. So I say ""I don't know"", but she still fires questions at me and I reply as best I can saying ""Not to short"" and ""Yes she does use clippers"" (referring to the other hair dresser). Eventually she gets started, and this is where I fuck up. She takes number 4 clippers and takes a chunk of hair out of left side of my head, I only expected her to trim around the edges but she went all in, I should have stopped her but I just don't have it in me to be rude. So I try to stay calm and let her finnish, after all, she is a professional. She completes the final touches... And it looks terrible. I have a long face, if that makes sense, and the way she cut it makes it look even longer. Now I'm sitting inside not wanting to venture outside for at least 3 weeks, but I have school in 2 days. Do you think I'm overreaching a bit?

TL;DR:","  Didn't say what I wanted when getting a haircut, hairdresser takes out a chunk of hair, looks terrible, sitting inside for 3 weeks now. Do you think I'm overreacting?",  I got a bad hair cut and I should have been a bit rude to the hairdresser to save it.

TITLE: I [20F] think I want to end my relationship with my Father [46 M]

POST: So growing up I have always had a good relationship with both my parents. They were great parents and there's nothing I can honestly complain about with how they raised me. I was also really close to my Dad when growing up. Please believe me when I say he wasn't always a jerk. He was a good Dad and husband. He taught me a lot and helped me to become the independent person I am today. 

Unfortunately, he is not that person anymore. Over the last two years he has just kind of been gone. He would not come home. for days. If he did come home he was always really drunk. Later I found out he was also under the influence of some drugs. He also cheated on my mom with a girl around my age. 

So I watched my Dad go from a happy-go-lucky guy to a sad, pathetic drunk. In May this all came to a head. It was a really tough time for my family. My Dad eventually told my Mom and I he was going to stop and he was going to get help. So, we tried to rebuild the family. 

I actually got to see my Dad happy again. He stopped drinking and doing drugs. He seemed to be making progress and I was getting ready to forgive him

Well, long story short, he was caught cheating again and doing the previously mentioned things. I just can't handle it. Why did he not just leave back in May? It could of been done with months ago. I just feel even more hurt now. 

I know he does not want me to cut him out of my life, but I don't know what else to do. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? Also, would it be better to just cut him out of my life completely? 

Sorry for the rambling. This is all pretty fresh still.

Should I cut him out of my life completely?,"  Over the last two years, my Dad has turned into different person and for the worst. He has been cheating, drinking and doing drugs.

TITLE: My friend's [27M] girlfriend has a serious issue with me [27F] for no reason. He won't address it.

POST: I've been very good friends with my friend, Chris, for 4 years. We met through my ex and we've always had a completely platonic friendship (I was also good friends with his ex-wife at the time). He's been in a relationship with his current girlfriend (Angela) for about a year and a half. For numerous reasons, I've only met her once about a year ago and she was very sweet and friendly. Since then we haven't seen each other because she travels for work and that's when Chris and I catch up; additionally, she has her own social life and on days when she wants to be alone with her friends, he and I will grab dinner. She never has a problem with that as far as I know.

Anyway, I went out with Chris, Angela, and another couple on Saturday and when we were exchanging hello's she just glared at me. No response. I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. 

The next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all. I was shocked and hurt, and he defended his decision not to ask because he has bigger priorities now (they're having problems-- no wonder). This is out of character for him.

I've never done anything to warrant this type of treatment and I'm concerned because we'll be at the same event in a couple of weeks hosted by his brother. I feel like I deserve an explanation, or at the very least, someone should raise the issue with her.

How do I discuss this again with Chris? :(

POST: We go to german lessons together, I met her a week ago. Our 'german group' is really small (only 6 people) and we're actually the only people talking to each other. 

She is very kind and friendly towards me and tries to initiate chat. She laughs hysterically(!) at some of my jokes (she doesn't laugh at ALL of them). She says ""hello"" in a very seductive way, yeah I know that's a stupid thing to say but I've never been greeted by a girl this way.

Note that this girl is BEAUTIFUL. And I mean perfect 10/10 and probably gets any guy she wants. I gotta say I'm an average looking guy, slightly above average in best case. I'm really not that funny guy, I don't lack social skills but I'm a bit weird, in a positive way.

TITLE: I need a gift idea for my daughter's first day of kindergarten. Help me, Reddit.

POST: My little girl was born 7 1/2 weeks early (which was also six weeks past the age cutoff for our school district).

After two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).
Now, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.

We've been terrified for a while of her having to wait an entire year for her to start kindergarten because she'd probably end up a huge discipline problem and start-off her entire school experience on a terrible foot.

After months of looking, we finally found a private school willing to bend the rules for her and that we can afford.  Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.

So, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.

But, I'm drawing a blank.  I've thought about jewelry, but what can I find that would withstand a kid that young and be something she'd want to keep as she gets older?

TITLE: Long distance girlfriend [24 F] of six months is moving again but not back where I [30 M] am.

POST: I got into a long-distance relationship about six months ago, right before my girlfriend made a temporary move. We were just getting to know each other at first, but things kept snowballing as we got to know each other and we got more emotionally involved. She has been back once since then and things kept building to the point that we were talking about life plans when she returned.

The problem is that she's now not going to return for several years.

The plan was that she would be back here for graduate school, but it turns out that she got an offer she can't turn down somewhere else. It's going to be a multi-year commitment of lots of work, and there's no guarantee she will ever be back here, even though it's currently part of her long-term plan.

So the options now are to give up or go with her. Neither really feels like the right choice. I encouraged her to go to the school because the offer was too good to pass up, and I'm not about to ask her to take out substantially larger amounts of debt so we can be together. But with her going to school, she will be locked in for several years and maybe longer once she starts her career. I can travel to see her more often than we have so far, but ultimately, I would have to move at some point. 

As for me, I'm further in my career, and it's unfortunately not one where good opportunities come up very often. I also have friends, connections and a current job where I am and wouldn't have chosen the city she's moving to for myself if I were to move. I worry that if I go, she will be all I have in this new place.

We both want to be with each other and have said that we thought this could be a lifelong relationship. We are both heartbroken at the thought of giving up, but staying together doesn't seem to be an option either.

Any words of wisdom from someone who has made long-distance work? Or from someone who has moved solely for another person? I'm heartbroken and distraught all at the same time.

TITLE: Me (22/F) and my boyfriend (31/m) of 2 years. Feeling rejected.

POST: Hey r/relationships, I need your advice. I'm posting this on mobile so I'm sorry in advance for any formatting errors! 

I met my boyfriend, L, 2 years ago. We hit it off instantly and the chemistry between us was insane. I know the age difference seems a little strange, but we've made it work with very little struggle until now.

We moved in together in August after dating for about 1.5 years. When we first started dating, we were having sex every time we saw each other. That was 5-7 times a week. Naturally as our relationship matured, the sex slowed down a little bit. For the past year and a half, we have sex maybe twice a month, and I have to initiate it every time. Since we've lived together (4 months) he has initiated once. Now I'm not naive, and I know he watches porn and masturbates daily. I've come across the porn on his phone. I've been trying to tell myself that I'm perfectly ok with this and that it doesn't hurt me at all. But I can't lie to myself anymore. I am hurt. He chooses porn over me daily. I've tried to talk to him before about how the fact that he never initiates sex with me hurts my feelings and makes me feel unwanted, and those conversations lead to him giving me a thousand excuses and initiating once the next day and everything goes back to the way it was for a few months. I've never brought up the porn because I'm really scared he will choose it over me... He really is the love of my life and other than this, our relationship is nearly perfect. He is a very caring man and I know he is who I want to spend the rest of my life with. R/relationships, how do I fix our sex life? I want to have sex more often, and I want him to initiate it more. I know I need to have a conversation with him, but I don't know where to begin.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend of 2 years never initiates sex with me and watches porn instead. It's putting a strain on our otherwise perfect relationship. How do I fix this?,  My boyfriend's porn habit is really hurting our relationship. How do I talk to him about it in a way that doesn't make me seem crazy?

I was truly heartbroken and I am still progressing this, but feel less for her every day now days. Within this time we've talked a little, mostly basic questions like how eachother is doing.

I figured out a couple of days ago that I still have a couple of things at her place, a grillpan, and a couple of other things. Now we live about 500 kms apart, so get it is really not that easy. So I messaged her about it. It goes a day or two, she messages back that she can't find a box that big for the pan to fit in. I replyed that she can buy a large box, she claims she does not know where to buy one big enough.

In the next message she askes ""Stupid question, but you wouldn't be able to come here and pick them up? :)"".

As much as I still have still feelings for her, but certainly not as much as before. I wonder what she really wants. I don't want to be rude either, we handled this breakup like two adults. I don't know if I want to see her, as she was my first love of course she will be special to me. What can I reply to this?

TITLE: Teachers vs. Unions - What do you think?

POST: Here are some thoughts, and feel free to chime in - this is a discussion not a debate.  I believe teachers should be well paid, based on merit.  They should have to take examinations and re-up their credentials on a regular basis.  They are, after all, the most important people in the world.

Here's the dilemma.  Teacher Unions are the scummiest, worst organizations in the world.  Yes, they protect teachers (some of the time) but put most of their effort in making money from (underpaid) teachers in order to perpetuate the myth teachers will die without a union to back them.

Sadly, in the US, teachers would likely get ass-raped by the powers that be if they didn't have a union at all.  So it's kind of a catch-22.

What do you folks think?

TL;DR:","  Teachers should be well paid based on merit.  Teacher Unions are the scummiest, worst organizations in the world.  What do you think?",  Teachers should be paid well based on merit and examinations for re-certification : Unions should die in a fire.

TITLE: Donating land out of Revenge. How will this help my tax returns?

POST: This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. 

A little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  

We discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? 

I want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)

TL;DR:","  Want to donate or sell land to reduce property tax burden. How will this affect tax refunds in the future? Also, I'm a student with an architecture degree.","  If I donate a piece of land to charity out of spite, can I deduct it from my taxes and if so, how much of the value would be retuned as a refund (all, none, some?)"

TITLE: What's the male equivalent of flowers?

POST: Basically, I want to do something sweet and romantic for my boyfriend. Here's the long version: 

According to the weather forecasts, it's going to be a beautiful day today. My boyfriend and I decided to go to a local park we've been meaning to visit for months - the weather just hasn't been nice enough until today. The park's right near a relatively swanky area, and since today's payday and we haven't had a ""date night"" in a while, we decided to get a pseudofancy dinner afterwards. I'm really looking forward to it. Things haven't always been easy or simple in our relationship, but I think we have a really good foundation and we're really making sure we put time in with each other to maintain it.   

With that in mind, I'd really like to do something special and sweet for him. He's more of a romantic type than I am, so I think he would appreciate it. However, I'm not sure what to do - if the situation were reversed, and I was a boy wanting to surprise a girl, I'd definitely get flowers. But I don't think that'll have the same effect...call me crazy if I'm wrong :) So I was wondering if Reddit could do me a favor and weigh in on what they think the equivalent of flowers are, for a guy. Suggetions are welcome! It's not a special event like an anniversary or anything, just a night out. I'd really love to hear what you have to say on this: I want to surprise him AND get him something (do something for him) he'll really appreciate.   

I know some people are going to respond to this with ""sex"" or ""bj,"" but if you can help it, please refrain. He's already going to get laid tonight, and probably getting blown for foreplay. I want to do something _besides_ that. (Or on top of that, heh.) Besides, I don't think sex should be a special-occasion-I-love-you surprise. That implies some shitty things about your love life, imo.    

Thanks for reading...please help me out!

POST: I have one that stands out from all of the rest.
I was 13; Me and 2 friends were at a minor league baseball game in the mediocre city of Columbia, SC. It was a diabetes benefit game that had rides and games set up out in an open area by left field, which included a bouncey-house thing and an enormous inflatable water slide contraption. At around half time, me and my dickhead friends decided it would be hilarious if we unplugged the bouncey-house while nobody was looking.  Nobody was remotely near it so we figured it would just a quick laugh and nothing dangerous.  My friend J pulled the plug out from a power strip on the ground, and we waited for about 5 minutes for something to happen, but nothing did.  We were just turning to get back to our seats when literally hundreds of parents started screaming and running to the giant waterslide behind us.  It had tipped over on its side and about 30 small children were clinging to the side as it deflated on top of them.  Terrified, we fled the stadium and sat outside.  A firetruck and 2 police cars showed up, so we ran and hid in the woods behind the parking lot.  An hour later, we returned to the stadium and learned that everyone was okay.  I laughed for so long and so hard that I was sore for days after.

POST: A bit of back story.  I have been using this company to register my domain and host my site for years.  Its a little site, nothing special, just my home business.  I am really attached to my domain name, so when I returned to school I kept up payments but didn't keep much of a website (just the basic info on some pages, more brags than business)

The company billed me for the hosting automatically.  That reminded me I should update a couple of pages.  It was gone, and it was parked!  I did a whois and found they bought it less than a month after I paid last year for two years.  I did update a couple of pages after I paid last year so it was working for a bit.  

I contacted the company and they were snarky.  They said that the CC payment hadn't gone through on the 24th of may.. which was true, for some reason the CC company thought using the CC online was suspicious, due to the fact it had never been used for that before.  It was cleared up and worked the next day.  I pointed out to them that the second payment had gone through.  Got a snarky reply that I had no idea what I was talking about and I must not have got the ""it didn't work email""

So the CC was contacted and provided a statement for that month, which clearly shows the payment went through and was charged to the account.  Armed with this knowledge I emailed them back saying I had the statement, and would a scan do or did they need it mailed to them.

That was 2 weeks ago.  What should I (can I) do?  I am just so bummed I really liked that domain name.

TL;DR:",  Company I paid for my domain name let it lapse just one month after I paid.  What can I do to get it back?  I really liked that domain name.,"  I paid for two years hosting, they took my money didn't renew my domain name.  What, if anything can I do.  Bummed my name is now parked."

TITLE: I (27/F) fooled around with a boy(25) that I like, but just met two weeks ago - do we talk about it?

POST: My roommate introduced me to his newest coworker about two weeks ago, and he's become a regular visitor and occasional overnight guest at the house ever since. We get along pretty well, and I think he's really cute. Definitely someone I would love to have in my life in some manner or another. I feel as though he's everything I've been wanting in a guy, but it's also a little early to make that call. Perhaps it's just the loneliness talking. We haven't spent much time with just the two of us.

Anyway, we're all kind of transient in our living situation at the moment - he's camping and I'm sharing an RV with my two roommates (a couple). It was snowy a few nights ago, so he crashed with us. I offered to share the couch bed so he didn't have to sleep on the floor (really just a ploy to cuddle). 

Well, I was just planning on cuddling, but the next thing I know he's slyly moving his arm around my waist, and hinted for me to make a move. I didn't object. One thing leads to another and we end up fooling around. 

It was great, and I'd totally do it again. I want to have this kid in some way, be it FWB, casual dating, or a long term relationship. Thing is, neither of us have mentioned it yet, and I'm not sure if I should? We've just been carrying on like nothing ever went down, but I'm afraid if it doesn't get brought up, I'll miss my opportunity. I also can't really read how he's feeling about it. 

What the hell do I say to him? Anything? Suggest we do it again? Send him a sexy text message? Keep quiet and wait for him? I'm bad at boys.

TL;DR:","  Fooled around with a cute coworker that I really like, but haven't mentioned it yet. Should I bring it up and risk missing out on a potential relationship?","  I messed around with a guy, and I'd like to either do it again or date him, but I don't know if/how to address the elephant in the room."

TITLE: My 10 year wedding anniversary is coming up and, unfortunately, we'll be totally unable to have any sort of real celebration. What can I do?

POST: So, long story short, we've been together more than 15 years, married for 10, no kids yet, and we love to travel. We've always traveled kind of thriftily, but I was planning a 10 Year Balls-to-the-Wall something or other until we got a little bad news: she needs back surgery, and she needs it fairly quickly. I started working to move my plans up on the calendar, no matter what the changes cost me, but then I found out that she's on strict orders not to travel while awaiting surgery. FML.

Her recovery time will be a small number of months, but in the mean time I'd like to commemorate the date with something a little more special than a really nice dinner, etc. To make matters more complicated, the surgery is only a few days after our anniversary date and it's happening in another city (Houston), so we'll be several hundred miles from most of our friends and all of our family except for her parents.

And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've looked into getting some of our friends to come down and have some sort of a party, but I couldn't get anywhere with that for a variety of reasons (not least of which was the aforementioned hundreds of miles of travel). I've rescheduled our whirlwind trip for as soon as she can reasonably be expected to be capable of travel, but that won't be for several months.

What can I do?

TITLE: My [21 M] boyfriend and I [20 F] have been dealing with alcohol/cheating related issues...

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for around 7 months now....it's pretty serious and we're really in love. I can't imagine being with anyone besides him. We get along beautifully and he always knows how to make me feel better. 

However, the first two weeks of school, one when I was here and one when I wasn't, my boyfriend got so incredibly black out drunk and cheated on me twice.
He has a history of alcoholism in his family and he has always been a heavy drinker, so his blacking out is not uncommon.
In the first instance he was at school a week before it started so he was just partying. He got so drunk that a girl who raped him last year (before we were together) I guess found him again and the same situation played out. They had sex but he really didn't remember until this past week. 
The other situation was him being blackout when I stayed in and his phone died so he couldn't answer my messages or calls and he called me at 4 AM from the floor of his apartment looking for me asking me where he had been all night and I, of course, couldn't answer. Turns out he had seen his ex girlfriend and she gave him a blowjob.
It honestly disgusts me so much that that happened but I have always chalked it up to his drinking. He's getting better with it, but now it just causes all of our fights because he is so ridiculous when he drinks.

I am not sure what to do....

POST: This cat currently lives on our front porch as our outdoor cat, we acquired him pretty recently. He was abandoned by a neighbor's brother, and has more than likely only been an outdoor cat for a few months. He wants to come inside desperately, and we want to let him inside. He's fully clawed, so we're worried he might tear the place up, and also wondering if he'd take to a litterbox. We could always get him declawed, but the housetraining thing is my real concern.

TITLE: I [23 F] am still thinking about my ex-boyfriend [23 M] of 5 years almost everyday. How can I move on?

POST: My boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me in early April. It came out of left field for me but apparently he hadn't been feeling the same about me for a while. There were no signs as far as I could tell, everything seemed normal. We had even hung out the previous weekend and everything was fine. Maybe I was missing the signs.

Anyway, since then I have not been able to stop thinking about him almost every single day. I'm not depressed or unable to enjoy life (surprisingly since i've battled depression and anxiety in the past) and am even having some really awesome things happen in my life. But he's always in the back of my head. I think the way he broke up with me really messed with me. I'm mostly confused and disappointed as to why and how he ended things.  

His explanation was all over the place and although we met a week after he broke up with me to clear things up, I still have a ton of questions that I feel deserve answers. 

My question is, is it best to just continue what I'm doing which is focusing on other things like work, family, friends, myself, etc.? Or should I try to contact him to get a better explanation of what went wrong?

We had said we would try to remain friends but we both needed time and agreed that when we were ready we would contact the other person.

TITLE: My [22F] recent ex [23M] of 3 year relationship suddenly has an attitude about moving out. I am so uncomfortable. What should I do?

POST: My boyfriend of 3 years was blatantly ignoring me and apathetic and I decided to break up with him because I was the only one putting effort into keeping the relationship together. He hurt me (flirting with exes, lying, trying to berate me) way too often and enough was enough. We live together, but he said he would be the one to move out since I'm recovering from an injury and I have fish that would be a pain to move. I told him I want to cut ties and I do not want to talk to him anymore. I do not want to be his friend.

I have heard him sobbing in the other room almost every night since the breakup. We have exchanged some letters but his letters don't make sense. He keeps saying he loves me and he doesn't know what he wants... That his emotions say he's ""making a continuous mistake"" but he is trying to be rational and needs space. He doesn't seem to accept the reality that I am DONE. It's over. I'm ready to move on. I feel like I don't love him anymore. 

Tonight I confronted him because my alternative plan fell through. He said that moving out was not a priority for him. He was very cold about it and seemed to be putting on an act. Is he trying to get in a last ounce of control? 

What are my options? I live in a city where it is hard to find decent rent prices. My cousin agreed to move in with me here, but my ex doesn't seem to want to leave. I need to give my landlord 30 days notice before leaving. I feel like I should just give her the notice tonight and abandon the apartment and just settle wherever I end up. I could squeeze into a studio but I'm a student and would be paying way more than I am now. I might reach out to my family to help fund an apartment by myself.

What should I do?

POST: I have the greatest boyfriend (19m) in the world right now. He is thoughtful, kind, he does everything in the world to make me feel important and special and I try to do the same for him. We have been together for about eight months now.

However right around the time we met I was exiting a really bad relationship that ended in me terminating a pregnancy. My current SO knows that that happened, and accepts me for who I am now, which given my past might be more then I deserve. On top of that from about feb-mid april my hormones were really nuts causing me to just be what felt like a shadow of who I was, but after some recent medication I feel a million times better.

I suppose my problem is that a part of me wants to run away from this relationship because I think I might have jumped into it too soon.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my GF[20F] When would you stay with crazy?

POST: I'll try to keep it somewhat brief. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. Once we were dating for awhile I realized she wasn't the most stable person... at all. She had very bad depression, anxiety, and migraines. She also gets jealous easily, has trust issues, and is slightly overweight. It took me a long time and a lot of effort to get her to go to her doctor to start taking meds. I tried to get her to see a therapist as well, but she only ended up going a few times and then gave up. When we were in college together still, her depression/anxiety was so bad that she gave up on going to classes and flunked out. She doesn't have her license, she currently works a minimum wage job and it's been 1-2 years since she's been in college. She was supposed to go last spring but that didn't work out, and she's supposed to go an upcoming semester but I'm not sure if she'll follow through. Her family is also pretty crazy which doesn't help the whole situation.

---

I see many people give the advice of leaving someone who seems depressed or has anxiety because ""they're crazy."" I don't really see these people as crazy unless it's a serious case and they're doing extremely immature, insane things. To me, it seems a little rude to just assume they're crazy and tell people to run away. For whatever reason I decided to stay and help her instead of running away. She's definitely improved a lot, but still has some issues. I guess I cared about her enough to spend a lot of my time and energy to stay and help. My question to you is: When would you stay with ""crazy""? What would make you stay, what would make you leave?

TITLE: **A personal finance tax, income, and asset brain teaser**

POST: Surveying /r/personalfinance for possible creative solutions or interesting perspectives on a unique situation. 

The subject is a 62 year old widow. Here are the measurables:
*Assets*: $800,000 in real estate. A primary and secondary residence of approximately equal value. Approx $1,200,000 in relatively liquid assets, roughly $700,000 of which are in tax-deferred accounts. 

*Income*
*~85,000 (before taxes)

*Expenses*
Subject makes an approximately $1,200 contribution to a tax deferred account each month, but otherwise spends almost all or most of her income to maintain the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. This includes upkeep of both properties, travel, and general enjoyment.  It is unlikely that a change in lifestyle is possible. The vacation property is rented on occasion. 

Here is where it gets interesting: Subject has approximately **$400,000** in a tax loss carry forward.  Subject's investments have not been performing terribly well as of late and subject does not have much in the way of capital gains to offset the tax-loss carry forward. Additionally, Most of subjects liquid assets are in tax deferred accounts.  Subject has about $570,000 in a taxable account. 

Subject would need to realize an approximately 80% gain in the taxable account to use up all of the tax loss (in addition, $3,000 each year of the tax loss can be applied to ordinary income). 

**Questions**
1) How can subject position herself to make the best use of her tax loss?
2) How should subject be allocating her assets to maintain her lifestyle and prepare for retirement? She plans to work 8-10 more years.

He has always been that way AND he has had huge crushes on all of them at one point in time before we started dating.) And I was a little jealous because I want more attention from him. So, out of curiosity, I asked about it. At first he said he didn't like any pictures. But then he said his brother does it most of the time.(His brother goes on his account often) Then he got really pissed at me over it. I didn't even sound mad about it. I kinda made a joke out of it when I asked. It's just frustrating because now he won't talk to me.

This came as great news, except I just learned that HR is going to get me an opportunity within my current firm to do something a lot cooler but I'd keep the same salary. The problem with the new offer is the distance to my current place and where my SO lives. I live currently close to Downtown and she lives 30 minutes south, the new job would be 40 minutes north west of where I currently live. Just before I got the offer I was looking to move closer to her, but that would mean about 1.5 hrs of driving every day. I have made numbers and the raise covers the price of gas. Is there anything I should do in addition to that to be able to make a better decision? I feel like if I stay at my current firm I'll be able to get an even bigger raise if I move out in the next few years, but not sure that this is the case.

POST: Hi. I'm 23, male.

I knew her since i was like 14, she was a year younger than me. We used to hang out almost daily for years - she lived just down the road from me. We were really good friends, and our friendship lasted until i was about 19. I was a really naive teen, and never realized she had feelings for me, even though she gave some massive signals. 

I had strong emotional feelings for her too, but i didn't really understand them at the time. I was a late bloomer. I went through a lot of hardships  and i slipped into a bit of a destructive state. I ended up pushing her away, i did it to protect her, but it ruined our friendship. I imagine she hates me now. 

I've only seen her once since (been 5 years), and we both completely blanked each other. I haven't attempted to contact her or anything, i could quite easily, but i don't want to talk to her and find out she hates me now. I still think about her a fair bit, and even have dreams about her. (non sexual). I know it's weird, but i'm not stalking her or involving her in any way so it's not hurting, right? 

Well, that's the past. The present is the problem. I don't feel attracted to anybody, sexually or emotionally. I have options, i'm not bad looking and i get interest on nights out, and a couple of friends who like me. But none of them interest me. 

I know this is really pathetic, but i don't know what to do. I want to get over her, but i still have the problem of not finding anyone else attractive.

TITLE: (FL) Cashier won't do her job properly. I want to fire her but HR says no because of religious reasons.

POST: Hi, legaladvice. I can't believe I'm in this situation.

I was recently promoted to Store Manager of a grocery store after the original manager quit (I was assisstant manager before for about 6 months).

We hired a woman, let's call her Sally, a couple of weeks ago. She's not terrible at her job (just basic cashier stuff) but she refuses to process payments that equal $6.66. I know, it sounds crazy.

Our store prices everything ending in 28 cents as a ploy (kinda like Brandsmart). So anything priced at $6.28 will ring up to $6.66 after tax, and it happens quite often that people will buy just that one item (which I've learned after Sally started working here).

Every time this happens, one of the managers or supervisors has to take over because she refuses and sometimes it throws a spanner in the works. I brought it up with HR and they said I can't do anything about it because it's her religious freedom (since 666 is the number of the beast in Christianity).

The thing is, we have the same religion; we even go to the same church! But I don't think she should be able to use that excuse to not ring those transactions. I've offered to move her to another part of the store but she doesn't want to stock or do anything else.

HR warned me not to decrease her hours or I'd get in trouble, but I just don't see how I can do my job properly if I have to take care of petty stuff like this.

Is there a law or something that says I'm right? I don't want to go back to HR without knowing I'm 100% right that she shouldn't have the job if she can't perform all aspects of it.

And if I'm wrong, I suppose I can bear it even if I do think it's ridiculous.

I've been offered a financially lucrative position in a beautiful country that I believe I could enjoy living in. Personally, things aren't so great at home, so were it not for my boyfriend, I would be jumping at the offer.

I've been in an on-again/off-again relationship for four years. He was my first kiss, first everything. I fell hard and never really got back up. We recently decided to try dating again after about a year of pretty much dating without the label.... however, I don't think a relationship (not just with me, with anyone) is what he wants. I think I pressured him into it.

So I have this offer. This dream job. But on the other hand, I have a chance at stability and finally being with the man I love more than my own life. I've never lived in a foreign country and honestly the thought terrifies me. But... what if I stay here? What if the relationship doesn't work out and I'm left here wondering.... what if? for the rest of my life? What if I move and, again, I'm wondering what if? but this time about the relationship?

I really just don't know what to do. I'm so torn. I can't eat or sleep, it's almost some sort of cosmic joke. Why would this offer come right when I have a chance with the person I've dreamed of for years? I just... I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:",  Been in an on-again/off-again relationship for 4 years. Offered a dream job halfway around the world. Should I take the offer or stay here and risk the relationship not working out?,  Trying to decide whether to leave the man I love and everything familiar to me to take a job in another country (a year-long contract; I don't see him waiting for me).

TITLE: Me [24 F] with the guy I've been seeing [22 M], unsure because of mixed signals

POST: This guy and I have been hanging out for 3 months now. We work together and have known each other for a few years before that. 

It started off as a once or twice a week hang out where we would also have sex. He eventually asked me out on a date, we went to the movies and dinner, for which he paid, even though I tried to offer. From there it escalated to texting, even briefly, everyday and for the past few weeks we have been hanging out three or four times a week. He is super affectionate and is always doing things to help me, whether it be at work, or smaller things when we have been hanging out. 

I'm currently confused though because we hung out Monday night at his house and we were both super tired, so we did not really get into any deep conversations. We just kinda hung around, watched tv, and eventually fell asleep. Usually we will hang out every other day or so or at least there will have been an effort to do so. I texted him last night to see what he was doing, and he responded that he was in a weird mood and feeling under the weather. I responded saying that I hope he felt better thinking that was the end of the conversation. He asked if I was doing anything yet for the night, and I said I didn't have any plans, but that I just thought of hanging out with him. He responded ""I was planning on that too earlier, sorry :("".

I am just at a loss of what to think. Am I overthinking this and he just is having a bad week? Or could this be the beginning of a fade? I guess I'm just also disappointed because his dad is gone for the week and he has the house to himself, so I wrongly assumed I guess that we would be hanging out more than once, which I am also worried is clouding my judgment of the situation.

Should I even bother trying to text him again to hang out? Or just give him space and wait to see if he contacts me?

TL;DR:",  Guy I've been seeing is giving mixed signals about hanging out. Says he was planning on something but then abruptly says he was feeling under the weather. Should I even bother trying to text him again?,"  Guy I'm seeing is sending me mixed signals, is it just me overthinking things or is he possibly not interested?"

POST: My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for 6 months now and everything always goes fine between us. We made it a point to always be honest with each other no matter what, and I have always been faithful to that.

I found out from a mutual friend of ours that a guy she knows has a very big thing for her and has been into her for a while now. I was unaware. This mutual friend also told me that this guy bought my girlfriend gifts, and she told me her mother bought them for her. The reason he buys her gifts is because she's not telling him that she's in a relationship with me, so he's been trying to woo her over. Quite frankly, I was hurt she was keeping our relationship a secret, especially to guys who like her.

She lied to me about the gifts and refused to tell me about all this because she wanted to avoid a conversation about it. Was I right or wrong to be upset about this whole ordeal?

Since he has passed, I just don't want to be known by that. My sister [28F]  [24F]and cousin have been calling me this because it reminds them of him. 

We got into an argument over it. I told them I don't want to be called Ladybug, it's something special I shared with my Uncle. I want to be known as Ellie, like they have called me for [25 years]. 

I am not really willing to compromise on this. At this point I kind of want to take a break from them. I am mourning and they keep reminding me of him in painful ways.

TITLE: My [27 M] GF [25 F] of 3 years just told me she has problems with sex because of past relationships

POST: My girlfriend and I have been sleeping together since the beginning of our relationship, and recently I've started trying to gently introduce more in the bedroom. she's always had a toy, but i've been trying to introduce more positions and experiences to make things a little more fun.

the other day we started fooling around and she abdruptly stopped me saying she didn't like anything I was doing (same thing I always do), she doesn't like making out, and she doesn't want anything new. She completely shut down and wouldn't say another word to me after this.

the next day she text me saying that she's had ""really terrible relationships, including really scary sex"" and that ""she has a problems with sex because of past relationships""

I'm not sure where to go from here, she won't talk about it, I also now have no idea what she wants in bed (she says normal sex is all she wants). Ideally I'd like for her to heal in some way and open up with me. Should we stop having sex all together for a while? I could suggest her see a therapist but I imagine that not going well.

TITLE: I [19 M] am finding that when I meet a girl, I get turned off if I find out that they are in a sorority

POST: So I'm in college and trying to meet as many people as possible.  For some reason, I tend to immediately get turned off if I find out that a girl is in a sorority.  I am personally not the most social person and don't really like going out to many parties, but that is exactly what a lot of these girls love to do.  

Specifically, there is this girl in one of my classes that I like and we get along really well, but she's in a sorority.  Let's say, for example, we started to date. I don't know how comfortable I would be knowing that she would be at these party's, while she, and many other guys, would be drunk. 

Is it in my best interest to not pursue girls who are in a sorority? Or do I have a false sense of what some of these frat and sorority parties are like and give it a shot?

TITLE: I [27M] have been the lover of someone with Borderline Personality Disorder [26F]. Recently recognized all her symptoms of BPD so I need advice, possibly from those who have been in a similar situations.

POST: For the last year, I have been in a very sexual relationship with this girl in whom I now see the symptoms of BPD. She's got a boyfriend and while I'm relatively open with my relationships, she gets extremely jealous. There were a couple of times where she tried to blame me for some problem that I really couldn't see myself at fault for. And then possibly as a revenge measure for me not giving a crap, she goes rebounding with some other guy (not even her bf). However after that in her calm episode, she regretted doing that on an impulse and even accepted that she might have BPD after we had a talk.

So now here's my problem. I'm a student of human behavior and after observing her behavioral patterns, researched a lot on BPD and Histrionic Personality Disorder. There were a few AMAs on Reddit as well and majority say to get out of there and cut all contact. Most of the guys there seemed to have been in serious relationships with the women in those instances. I'm in it for the amazing sex but people say that the manipulation will start setting in. I've already noticed that I've been investing more time with her over the last few months. 

She's agreed to treatment so should I bother being a support figure for her since she's got a bf anyway? Or continue with the sexytimes til things get crazier?

TITLE: Me [31F] with my Husband [38 M] 12 years/4 Married, Talking about divorce. Outside of infidelity, why did you get divorce?

POST: My husband and I have been lightly talking about divorce for a while now but it looks like I may be going through with it soon. 
**Details:**
Met in college. He worked the same job until we moved out of the country for 2 years after I got laid off. I've always earned more money, paid more for things, until we lived out of the country- he earned more money. I stayed at home, had baby. We're back in the states- hes getting degree and we're planning on going back overseas with his new degree so he can earn more money. He's now studying and I'm the only one working. I came back 5 months before him to try and get settled first. So we spent that time apart. He came back in Jan. 14.

We have a 19 month old and are currently under a lot of financial stress (I'm filing chapter 7 soon, 1 income), he is trying to start a new career (teacher) and we are living with my parents and teenage brother. We have little privacy and very little time to ourselves, with or without the baby. We sleep in separate beds often because of the baby and we barely have sex (maybe once every 3 months), we're both faithful however.

 So all these are all factors...but this weekend after letting him go out to meet with a lady that he met at a teachers thing and hang out with her at an art museum all day he came home with a migraine so I let him rest. This morning we go out for brunch and he's a complete asshole to me because I don't want him to rush our brunch/mess up my semi-planned day so he can go meet up with one of his students (male) and he mentions divorce again while in the car. This triggers me to get pissed and actually go online and look into filing. 
It's hard to actually pull the trigger. I'm trying to figure out if it's the circumstancel that we're in (which is temporary but taking longer then planned) or if it's really just over. 

I'd just like to know what to do- How to figure out if this marriage is over or not.

TL;DR:",  Husband is talking about divorce again after a rough patch. It looks like I may be going through with it soon.

POST: Hi girls. Need some advice and never been in this position that I know of before. We've hung out for almost a month now. Never been sexual besides some kissing and light touching and he just recently told me he has had herpes for a while and for him it is very manageable. I could tell it was very hard for him to tell me. He is a big strong guy and had tears in his eyes telling me. He said he isn't on meds but he'd b willing to for sure.

TITLE: I (17m) don't know what to do about a pretty good friend (16f), of about 2 years, who's drifting away. Nothing romantic.

POST: So I have a group of friends from a couple of schools who have formed around a few peoples friendships, basically hipsters and nerds, who just kind of ended up hanging around each other a bit, sharing a lot of interests , etc.

Anyway my friend came into the group kind of latish and is always saying that she feels separate, coming from a completely different school from everyone else and says she recently got very socially awkward.

She had drifted away for almost a year and I hadn't seen her for months and months so I decided to message her a few times and just see how she was doing, if she wanted to keep talking or what.

I helped her through some stuff as well as I could and she seemed to appreciate it. We kept talking and she annoyed me a few times, a combination of me having a couple of bad days and her being a bit stand offish. One of these times I unloaded a tonne of my issues onto her, basically telling her to fuck off and get off my back in a polite way. She messaged back very contritely and said she was always there for me.

Yet it doesn't seem like she is, she rarely starts conversations with me, about twice in the last 3 months and I just don't think she actually cares for me despite everything she says. Actions are worth more than words right? So currently, I've decided to stop talking to her. If she wants to talk to me, great. Otherwise as I'm the only one from the group she was talking to recently, after my 18th birthday party which I will invite her to because I've already said so, that'll be it for our friendship. Am I doi.g the right thing? I haven't really talked to her about this because I dont wanna be really needy and should I have to talk to her about it when she's ignored my problems other times?

TL;DR:","  My friend is drifting away, I unloaded a lot of my issues on her and she apologized but doesn't seem to care for me anymore. Should I cut off contact with her?",  my friends drifting away. As much as I don't want to lose her I don't want to be needy or the only one in the friendship who cares. I'm going to start ignoring her unless someone has a better idea.

TITLE: Me [25/F] with my fiance [25 M], tells me he's not sure if we should get married-wedding in less than 4 months.

POST: We met in college and have been together for 6 years. Last summer we got engaged and we're planning a wedding for this coming summer. There have been a few ups and downs in our relationship- mainly I have an issue with him drinking and cheating on me in the past (it happened twice). He had a rough life growing up and not the greatest role models or guidance, so his coping skills occasionally include drinking, which really bugs me. I encouraged him to seek counseling instead of drinking and he did for a while, but then stopped. Also the cheating was very early on in the relationship and then once last year. He was extremely tearful and apologetic, so I (maybe naively?) forgave him.

So, fast forward to now. Things have been really great or so I've thought. He hasn't drank in at least 8 months and has been really taking care of his health. Until tonight I thought we were really happy. I was woken up to him being loud on the phone and I got up to ask him to be quiet. When I saw him I knew instantly he was drunk. We got in an argument and I shut down and left the room crying. He followed me and by this time he was also crying and saying he just ""didn't think he could do it anymore."" And that he's not sure if it's the right thing to do. I asked why  and basically he said because he's never seen a successful marriage (true) and that ""someone better might come along."" 

I am so heart broken. Obviously I know this conversation shouldn't have happened like that and in his state, but it did and now I don't know what to do. Is there any hope in this at all?

TITLE: [18/m] I love a girl (19/f), but I'm in an atypical friendzone. Go for it or don't risk ruining the friendship?

POST: She's amazing. Funny, super cute. She likes me, a lot, and we have a lot of physical contact. The problem is her family is super-Christian, and she, while not a fanatic, is very religious. I'm an atheist. It doesn't really bother her, and her religion doesn't really bother me. But it has restricted the bounds of our relationship.

We talked about the possibility of dating, and the way she sees it is that the relationship will never go very far, i.e. marriage. Not that she wants to go into a relationship only if she thinks she'll marry, but that she thinks that we can never break that barrier. She agrees that we'd be great together, and that we might date for years, but that eventually she KNOWS we would never go further than that.

My opinion is that we should take the happiness while we can get it. She doesn't want to go into a relationship knowing it will end, which seems pessimistic and a little illogical to me. Love is about risk, and in my opinion you go for it and if it hurts in the end, the happiness was worth it.

I think that she thinks we're done talking about it, but I'm thinking about bringing it up again. Should I risk losing her friendship, which I don't really think would happen, but would be awful, in order to state my argument better?

Additionally, I'm totally not good enough for her.

POST: already posted but im looking for more advice.

I am a non druze female who was in a relationship with a druze male, we dated for a year and for both of us it was our first love. Even though we're still young it truly feels like he's it for me and vice versa. However, recently we hit a crossroad and he decided to end things. Since in Druze culture you are unable to marry out of the culture and if you do you are no longer considered a druze, and then you and your family are looked down on and shunned in the community. However, some people i talk to say in druze culture it's different for guys and it may be acceptable for them to marry someone outside the culture. He doesn't really follow his religon/culture, he's just scared of how it'll affect his parents, he says he can't loose them or let them down. He doesn't want them to die unhappy, feeling like they failed. I really dont think they'd completely disown him, and i think he knows that, he just wants them to die content and they apparently can't if hes with someone outside the culture. But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing. But by being appart its destroying the both of us, im unable to move on and let go of him, i just can't give up hope. And he is regretting his choice everyday, but he's so torn. He tells me ""maybe one day we can be together but i can't bank on that"" which makes me feel like him and i can be, i can't let go.. I feel like hes just scared and he always stresses about the future, so maybe he's just having a quater life crisis?

TITLE: [24M] my girlfriend [25F] of 1 year, doesnt trust me anymore

POST: I've screwed up. 

I've been going out with her about a year and we have lived together about 6 months.

I've told my girlfriend a few times that I would be home by a certain time on nights out by myself and for various reasons ended up being home much later.

It's happened a few times now and each time she gets more and more angry. 

The first time I just stayed out because I was really drunk and I forgot what I'd told her. When I came home she was really upset and after a few days we made up and I promised to not let it happen again.

Then a few nights ago I went out on my own, told her I'd be home by 1am.

She was skeptical but I was adamant that she could trust me and I wouldn't do what I did last time.

But I ended up getting lost, couldn't find the right bus (we're very low on money), then had to wait over an hour for a cab, and ended up getting home at 4am.

Now she says she'll never believe a promise I make etc and she thinks I just went out to a club and didn't give a shit about her etc.

I can't prove that I couldn't get home and I can see why it looks like what she thinks (that I just said fuck it and went out till 4am and took a cab home), even though I know it's not true.

She's now not talking to me, and last time she was this upset we almost broke up.

How can I fix this?

TITLE: My (28f) boyfriend (28m) watched porn excessively and was caught. Now I keep looking at his phone and invading his privacy out of insecurity. What do I do? Help! NSFW

POST: Back story: we have been dating for 2 years. About a year and a half into our relationship I was checking his internet history just to find an old website with a recipe I made for dinner before. I usually don't mind my boyfriend watching porn. It's completely unrealistic to think guys don't fap. But I found out he had been messaging the girls on the subreddit complimenting them. I flipped out naturally because that was crossing the line. He said he was addicted to porn. He went to talk to a therapist who said he didn't need to be treated. I felt betrayed but still forgave him. 

Fast forward 6 months: I find myself constantly needing to check his phone and computer to see if he watches it still or messages girls. I feel more insecure than ever. He caught me looking on his phone history. I was honest and told him that I was looking to see if he still is watching porn in random moments like he used to. What do I do? I don't like being like this. I want to trust him. I'm scared he is going to keep on doing it behind my back. 

Am I overreacting?

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend watched porn excessively and was caught. Now I keep looking at his phone and invading his privacy out of insecurity. What do I do? Help!

TITLE: Girl in friendship group [18/F] has randomly switched and friendzoned me[18/M] please help?

POST: I've recently started uni, had eyes on this girl from the start, we got talking, flirting, (to be fair she said right from the start she didn't want a relationship, I wasn't phased by that though I did want something exclusive) but then we began to meet up a couple times, we kissed, texted everyday flirting, etc. but all of a sudden she's now decided she wants to call things off, we're in the same friendship group but this didn't affect us at the start and I think were both mature enough to not let that affect anything. She wont deny liking me but says since she doesn't want a relationship she doesn't want to carry on with what were doing.
I had some bad news in the family recently and since I live away from them now I feel I sort of clung to her due to the affection she gave the past few days, I fear this has put her off.

-----Most people you ask will say I'm attractive, confident and funny - I do not mean to come across arrogant it's just to give you an insight to what I'm like! She is a nice girl, a virgin, by the way, not a player-----

The question is, I really like her and I don't want things to go that easily, how can I sway her views, and look to atleast get a date and maybe more from her? I really don't feel up for the friendzone... Do I need to make her jealous, if so how? Or at least, how do I recover?

Well, on april fools, my first class i convenced my teacher to write me up for punching my sisters best friend in the face. My mother would have believed this since we did not get along at all. I had the teacher sign it, the principle and the school officer. I then received premission from the principle to go home early as if i was suspended. I called my mother 20 minutes after school started at told her i was suspended for fighting. Assuming my mother would pick me up and ground me for the day until i told her the truth after school was out (so i could sleep all day)....I was wrong. My mother called the police on me to arrest me for assult. I had to explain to the officers and my mother it was a joke. I was grounded for 3 weeks becuase of this.

POST: All right. So this has a little backstory. The ""friend"" is someone I have been trying to date for the past month and a 1/2. She said yes to go out with me, but when I invite her out on a date, she says she wants to get to know me better before we jump in to anything.

Ok. I get that. We just start hanging out here and there. Get to know each other. I learn that she's had issues with her weight. It's a big problem for her. Not a problem for me. Fast forward to last Saturday (3/26), and she tells me that she's failing school and wants to focus on herself right now and isn't looking for a relationship. I was pretty broken up because it came out of nowhere and I thought things were going great.

I've still talked to her these past few days like nothing happened. Nothing relationship related, though. Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, ""Bae"" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways.

Last night, she sent me a snap that just said, ""Wow."" Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.

I asked a few of my friends about their opinion on the situation and they said she's just trying to control me. I just have no idea what I should do. Hell, I'm still confused and not sure how I really think about it.

TITLE: [Serious] What value are men to women?

POST: This is a serious question, not a troll.  I've completed a stage of therapy, and my lesbian therapist has informed me I am not really lesbian or even that strongly bisexual, but instead I am emotionally unavailable.  She says I kept attracting gay and bisexual men because it was a way of telling and proving to myself I was open to dating men while also remaining safe.  She also said I tend to see relationships and men in very dire, pessimistic terms (she's correct), and am not yet open to seeing them positively.

Therapist wants to begin the next stage with me and calls it healing my emotional unavailability.  

I'm pretty scared and feel like it's worthless to even try.  Yep, I was completely over attracting gay guy after gay guy after mind game player after misogynist over psycho after headcase, but I feel ""healing"" this unavailability will just make me open to even worse exploitation.  So far I've experienced heterosexual men as brute, primitive, stupid, sex-obsessed oafs who prefer throwing a sports ball to interacting with women and see us only as dolls and toys -- or obsessive stalky maniacs who want to suffocate, smother and use women.  I know this is not healthy and not true.

If it's in you, Reddit, please in a serious, hopefully somewhat compassionate way list some ways heterosexual men are of value to heterosexual women.  I'll use these lists to work on my intellectual resistance to healing.  Right now I don't see any connection between women and men at all, I see no value whatsoever to men except as business partners and buddies, and I see marriage and other types of heterosexual relationships as women-exploitative.

(And yeah, I know you'll see the opposite as just as horrible, but please skip those kinds of answers right now.  I'll just use those as fuel to further hate men.)

Instead I want to see true ways men can be of value to women, so that when my resistance comes up in therapy over the next months I have a ready list I can confront my misandrist inner voice with.  For all compassionate, serious responses, REAL GRATITUDE.

TL;DR:","  My therapist says I am emotionally unavailable and I want to know some ways men can be of value to women so I can work on my intellectual resistance to healing.  Please provide real, serious responses.",  In therapy.  About to do emotional unavailability healing.  Scared.

TITLE: book about a cat that eats typewriter keys, shoelaces?

POST: I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s ... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms ""cat"", ""typewriter"", ""shoelaces"" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.  I can't believe this book isn't a hit that immediately pops up on Amazon or google.  I loved it enough to still be talking about it almost 30 years later.  My family thinks I'm crazy, but I don't think I'm even creative enough to make this up...

TITLE: TIFU by eating Taco Bell and feeling the aftereffects

POST: Back when I was about 13, I was absolutely insane for Taco Bell. We decided to eat there after a long day of soccer and I ordered my grand 3 hard tacos combo and ate up.
Later that night, the tacos thought it would be a fine-ass idea to retaliate and make me feel worse than Billy Ray Cyrus felt about the progression of his shit daughter Miley. Trying to ignore the wrenching stomach pains, I went to bed and expected to wake up fine in the morning. 
I woke up at about 3AM, stomach pains pounding in my interior.
Well, knowing things couldn't be good, I expected to puke. Being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I thought ""fuck-it, Ill hold it in and go back to bed."". Well, what a great idea that I pulled out of my ass.
Minutes later, puke gushed out of my mouth like Niagara Falls, hitting the left side of my bed and forming a nice pile.
Still being the lazy-ass thirteen year old I was, I dismissed the idea of cleaning it up right now and thought ""Hell, I need some sleep, I'll just do it in the morning.""
So I went back to a peaceful slumber.

The next morning, I awoke with a disgusting stench and finally comprehended what had gone on the night before. I looked to where the puke should have been, but there was only an orange stain and a bit of chunky leftovers there. Fuck you, Taco Bell.
I immediately look down and see puke all over my blankets, clothing, and even bare skin. Being the movement-filled sleeper I am, I must have rolled around in the pile of puke during my sleep and successfully got it all over my bed sheets and body.
Feeling defeated, I shamefully took a long ass shower that morning and washed my bed sheets.

TL;DR:","  Was extremely hungry for taco bell, ate it, puked, puked all over everything, shamefully took a long ass shower and washed everything.","  Ate Taco Bell, puked at 3AM in my bed, was too lazy to clean it up and woke up covered in puke from rolling around in it."

*I'm 21, female, and pretty much any extra weight I carry in my stomach.

*I'm not overweight by any means. I'm about 5'5"" and fluctuate between 120 and 125 pounds.

*My body is...disproportionate, which will tie in with the first two bullets. I have very long legs, and a pretty short torso, which means pretty much ANY extra weight is visible in my stomach (since, as mentioned, I carry weight in my stomach).

Here's where r/loseit comes in. What do I do to lose those stubborn pounds in my stomach?

HOW FUCKING EVER,

Every time I open my god damn laptop, there's porn.  I unflip the iPad, there's porn. I feel like every time I use a piece of technology for the day, he has already used it, beat off on it, and left the porn open for me to see.  I have come home to my laptop covered in astroglide. I open to pages of forums where he has sorted through 8 pages just to find titties when he is ""using the iPad for homework"" and can't be bothered to converse with me.

I don't know why I am hurt, but I am. I am a very reasonable girl and I have expressed my concern; I don't want to see the girls you beat off to. However, every chance he is presented with to make it subtley known, he takes it. Most delete their history, this son of a bitch rubs it in my face time and time again.

Is this passive aggressive? I don't see how he could be so forgetful when I have expressed my discomfort.  Wat do? How could I confront him? Do I try to shrug it off? I don't like to make a big deal out of something so stupid, but gah.

I felt offended by that since he was basically saying that our relationship isn't special to him in a way, and that he doesn't feel like it's serious or anything.

TITLE: Me 26M with my girlfriend 25F of 4 months, wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral but i haven't met her family

POST: So my girlfriend has anxiety and is very emotional. I tend to solve problems more logically etc. Anyways, she asked if I'd go to her grandmother's funeral depending on when it was. Her grandma is currently in hospice so the time is coming soon. I've never been to a funeral before and I've never met my girlfriend's family.

The twist is that she doesn't have a good relationship with her dad and refuses to talk to him. This creates tension with her mom and her sister who live with her dad. I don't really think it's appropriate to be meeting her family at a funeral and I don't know her grandma at all. I told my girlfriend I'd take off work or whatever possible to be there for her after she gets home from the funeral (we don't live together). However, she started crying saying she really needs me there and needs someone to hold her hand. 

While I understand the logic behind this, it's also a big deal for me because 1. Her dad and her are in a feud and I really don't want to be a part of any sort of family drama at a funeral. 2. Meeting her mom and her sister or any family at her mom's funeral is going to be weird to me. Everyone's going to be crying and I don't know any of them yet, so the first time I meet them all it's going to be really sad. 3. I've never been to a funeral before and the closest thing is being in the room while putting my favorite childhood dog down with my family.

Girlfriend got really upset when I told her these reasons and said she expects to have a boyfriend who is there to support her. I understand her perspective which is why I offered to be there for her after she gets back. But she really wants to hold hands during the funeral itself.

Don't know what to do! I told her I'd think about it more, but she is still upset that she might have to 'ask someone else to go with her'.

TL;DR:",  Girlfriend wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral but I've never met her family and don't know anyone there. She is very emotional and wants me to hold her hand. Don't know what to do.,  Girlfriend wants me to go with her to her grandmother's funeral but I havent met any of her family.

My burgers on the grill, I reclined in a lounge chair on the balcony and began my assault. I tossed my first grape at the first taxi, and missed. Of course, but hey, it's the thought that counts. 

A couple of grapes later, I tossed a juicy purple ball of death down, aiming for the sickening yellow roof of my sworn enemy, when along came a convertible. Nice car, I thought as the grape soared down to its target. Then the wind gusted. I lost sight of my weapon as it traveled to its final destination.

TITLE: My friend's sister [WI] is being scammed by an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon. Is there anything we can do?

POST: It's a long story and it doesn't really matter but essentially my friend's sister (lives in WI) met someone on Match.com and has sent somewhere in the neighborhood of $30k to this Internet woman who claims to live in Oregon.

Based on [this Travel.state.gov report] (not to mention *common sense*) it is beyond a doubt that this person is a scammer.

For anyone who finds this thread in the future, a [quick search] of Reddit turned up the following similar old threads: [1] [2] [3] [4](

The scammer *IS* a real person, a white female with a foreign accent who claims to be Italian-American, has talked to my friend's sister on Skype, and based on some basic sleuthing has a phone number that seems to be a land line in Oregon. She claims to run an antique business that does appear to have a website, but there is zero actual information on it so it pretty clearly looks like a shell.

So far here are the best tips I've seen:

* Reverse image search this lady's Match.com photos
* Investigate the land line and antique business (not sure how)

I would *happily* post this scammer's personal information on 4chan or wherever if I really knew how that worked but I understand the ""not your personal army"" business.

It has gotten so bad that my friend and other members of the family are saying that this sister needs to give them financial power of attorney so that she doesn't keep sending all her SSI checks to this sketchy woman. It's a good step but if the sister doesn't go along with it it'll never happen.

I've seen advice on here before that ultimately going after the scammer isn't going to lead anywhere, and the problem needs to be fixed at home. I'm just asking to make sure.

TL;DR:",  Friend's sister is being scammed by an Internet scammer claiming to live in Oregon. Is there anything we can do to protect her from this scammer?,  My friend's sister is obviously being scammed. What do we do? Is there any precedent for bringing legal proceedings (or anything else) against someone like this?

TITLE: [NY] Am I required by state Labor Law to take a meal break after 6 hrs of work?

POST: Or can I elect to work through my so-called ""legally mandated"" 30 minute unpaid meal break without penal rescourse againt my employer?

I write full-time for a New York newspaper owned by an out-of-state conglomerate. I am paid hourly. My workplace is not unionized (except, for some reason, the mail room).
 
The explanation I have been given, which seems similar to one given to r/BrainStewYumYum in a [post] from Pennsylvania, is that a previous audit exposed the company to fines and repayment for not properly allowing meal breaks.

I rarely have time for an uninterrupted meal break, given the unpredictability of calls and schedule limitations of officials and often informal, chaotic schedule. I eat of course, but frequently in small poritons on the fly over even an eight hour period, often nothing more than a midday snack after breakfast at home on a sixer.

Essentially I clock 3 hrs weekly of untaken break. At a paltry $13.50/hr, that's a significant yearly loss of roughly $2,000. I have been threatened with three verbal warnings for the violation, a fourth will elevate discipline to a written warning.

Am I at the mercy of the company's self-proclaimed workplace statutes on this one, or am I permited under Labor Law to be paid for the time worked?

But anyways, we were off and on in high school, we went to different colleges and we've both been with a bunch of other people, but we always come back to each other. She's told me a bunch of times that she loves me too, and that she doesn't want anybody else, but at the same time it's never really been exclusive and I don't think it would last too long if we tried to make it exclusive.

I'm a little bit beside myself, but at the same time I want her to go and have fun and get the most out of it.

I wonder if anyone's ever had a similar situation? I'd like to give her something she could take with her that would make her think of me once in a while, whenever she takes it out and looks at it. Something really sweet that'll make her go ""aaawwww!""  I know it's kind of an obscure request seeing as how nobody knows either of us, but it doesn't have to be something personal. And any ideas might help me think of something. I know this is something I should come up with on my own, but romance was never my thing and I don't have much time left. 

And honestly it doesn't have to be a gift, it could just be something we do before she leaves, but the gift idea seemed good to me. Like I said I'm really bad at this. Please help me!!!

The week after they broke up, he tells me he got a girls phone number. 'Lookie me, I'm hot stuff, I got a girls phone number! She was totally into me!'. I tell him grats, good for you, and carry on. 2 days later, he tells me he got 4 other phone numbers from extroardinally hot girls.

He tells me the story of how he got the number for each girl individually. By the third girl it's getting old, but eh, I'm his friend, so I'll sit and listen. He then proceeds to tell this same story to ALL our other friends, making everybody hear the story like 3 times.

R. is not a very good looking guy. He dresses poor, he IS poor, actually, and doesn't pay attention to hygiene a whole lot. Yet he constantly keeps bragging about getting girls phone numbers, and then asks me what the last time was I had sex. (I came out of a long relationship,

TL;DR:","  My douchebag friend constantly brags about getting girls phone numbers, and then asks me what the last time I had sex.",  Don't stick your dick in crazy. And I just don't want to be with a girl at this point in my life).

TITLE: My [M 20] ex [21 F] is a close part of my friend group. Makes no contact near impossible and moving on more difficult.

POST: So I recently went through a somewhat messy breakup with my girlfriend of 6 months where she kinda cheated on me or at least I felt cheated on. Before being my girlfriend, she was my best friend for a year and close friend for many years before that. 

Now my high school friend group is a really close group of friends that she is a part of that has stayed close even throughout college. We all still see each other and hangout often. 

So after the breakup I prescribed to the No contact thing. We both agreed to cut off all texting and social media contact which has been really helping me for the past three weeks. The only problem is that if I still want to see my friends as often as i'd like, I do have to see her in group settings and the last two times it happened it has sent me into an anxious wreck because I see her texting or snapchatting the guy that she cheated on me with. I get that she's free to do what she wants but I just feel so betrayed and horrible everytime I see it. 

I don't know what t do reddit. I can't just never see my friends and become a shut in. These people are my closest friends in the world for a long time but I need help dealing with the minimal contact very week or every other week I need to have with her for a night of hanging out.

 Also I should point that the group is usually more than 5 or 6 people and I'm not trying to be friendly with her. I'm civil with her for the sake of it not being awkward but I don't by any means want to be close friends with her. I like the idea of no contact.

I have no intentions to be a home wrecker, so that's done with. However, he was the one who invited me to his hotel room and since we were both attracted to each other, we pretty much hooked up then and there.

Anyway we haven't hooked up since that night because I never gave him the chance. How should I put it to him lightly that I don't want to hook up anymore? Deep down I'm still sexually attracted to him, but I don't want him to know because he will keep pushing it.

TITLE: I've fallen back in love...

POST: This is just a personal achievement for me, but I have just read my first book in months.

Ever since my uncle passed away (he was like a father to me) I haven't been able to pick up a book and read. This is an issue as I had what my family rightfully explained as ""book cravings"".

I would actually get antsy if I hadn't read for a day or so, which meant that being employed full-time I found myself reading smaller novels, mostly aimed at teens (yes this includes all those vampire fictions, it was interesting to see whether the storylines differed. I'm female which made it seem less weird I guess!), just to satisfy my mind. 

The week after my uncle's funeral I engrossed myself in as many books as I could, as the previous week was spent helping my mum, grandma and sisters plan his funeral

The last novel I read was about a week after he passed away, was ""Cleo"" by Helen Brown. I am a great cat lover but it was more than a story about a cat and the antics it gets up to. It's about healing. And it was also the first book that almost brought me to tears. But since then I just couldn't read.

I still borrowed books but they stayed in my bag until they were due back.

Anyway, today I walked into a bookstore on a whim, and picked up ""After Cleo: Came Jonah"" as I loved ""Cleo"", and hadn't realised she had released a second book.

It was beautiful. It didn't make me want to cry, and the feel of the novel was different, but it worked so well. I actually now physically feel lighter after reading it (I started it about 5:30pm, it's now 9:50pm! Not a bad time!) and it's funny how I didn't realise I had this dark weight above me.

Just feels good to get back in touch with the book-craving me again :)

TL;DR:","  Uncle passed away, couldn't pick up book for a while, read ""Cleo"" which was beautiful, picked up After Cleo which was equally beautiful, feel lighter and more in touch with book-craving me","  I read my first novel in months after not going for much more than a day of reading for as long as I can remember.

TITLE: I'm [20F] going to a funeral for the first time, for my [69F] grandmother's [75F] best friend. I don't quite know what to do.

POST: Hi all. Sorry in advance for formatting, I'm on mobile right now. 

Very recently my grandmother's best friend died. She was like a sister to her, and I was also very close with her since I was young. The way she died was absolutely horrific, and my grandmother held her in her arms as she passed.

This Friday an open casket funeral is being held, and my grandma asked me if I would like to go. I told her I would. I have been asked to be at funerals twice before in my life, though I've refused, for (very) distant family.

My problem is that I don't deal with death/the dead well. I am not religious but spiritual. Seeing any type of dead body makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable. I don't believe that any part of a person or 'soul'  stays in a body after they die, only that the body is a remaining vessel, not really the person themselves... If that makes sense. My grandma and most of my family understand and respect my beliefs but at the same time, it has always been custom for them to at least view, if not touch/kiss the forehead of their loved ones one last time. I don't think I can touch her body, let alone see it. I can't really describe what it's like, but I just get such a bad feeling from bodies, and I have never seen someone I've loved in a casket before.

Basically, I'd just like some help on how to act appropriately at the funeral, while also avoiding (as much as I can) making myself uncomfortable. In addition, it would also be cool if I could get some tips on etiquette in general, what is appropriate to wear, things like that.

TITLE: me [29m] with my downstairs neighbour [30sf] and her pot smoking habit

POST: I purchased a condo about a year and a half ago and have been having an ongoing problem with the lady who lives downstairs. She smokes pot A LOT. She has told me she has a prescription for it; though we do live in an area where smoking pot is illegal. Her living room is immediately below my bathroom/bedroom. The building is old and has poor insulation which therefore means every time she smokes it fills my bathroom (and bedroom) with the smell of pot. When I first moved in I enquires with all the owners at a meeting (very small building and it's not professional managed) and each one claimed they don't smoke pot. I knew someone was lying as it cannot be smelled while outside, only inside my unit. One day I approached my neighbours door for something unrelated and was hit with the smell of pot as soon as I approached. She's since confirmed that she smokes pot but refuses to stop or smoke it outside. 

Beside the fact that I've never done pot and find the smell disgusting, I'm intending to apply for my city's police department. They have a very strict policy regarding drugs (for example, cutting out family members who do drugs, asking someone who rents to move, etc). I am very concerned that by ignoring this problem and smelling pot all the time I will be affecting my chances of being hired. 

I do not want to involve police if possible. It's a small building and this would cause a lot of animosity. 

I am looking for advice on how to escalate this and hopefully come to a resolution. I have already brought it up but she will claim she's not smoking and has no idea why I'm smelling pot. I'm not sure what my next steps should be (formal complaint, written complaint, etc)

Any advice in how to approach this and (hopefully) maintain an amicable relationship would be appreciated!

TITLE: TIFU by not locking my phone

POST: It's the last day of the year. My family is quite big and most people live apart from each other. So for this year they decided to meet up at my grandmother's house: it's 21 people in a not so big house. I should mention most of them are also extremely right-wing, which made it hard for me to tell them I'm gay, so I kept postponing it.

I should mention that my phone keeps dimming the lights when I read, so I put the screen to dim at 10 minutes but to lock at 15. It's usually not a problem since I always lock it manually when I put it down.

Well, today I was sexting with my boyfriend on the bathroom. After a while I was super horny, so I threw my phone on the sink and went to take a quick shower. Once I finished it, I went to the room I was sharing with my cousin to put on some clothes.

Well, as you may have guessed, my phone was untouched long enough to dim the lights, but not enough to lock itself. My cousin took my phone and saw a bunch of dirty texts between me and my boyfriend.

And he told on me. He told on me hard.

They didn't say much to me, just a bunch of judgemental looks. I'm spending the night alone since it's too expensive to transfer my flight.

TITLE: How to let go of a feeling that is just starting?

POST: Me (23 woman) dated a guy (29) a month ago. We didn't like each other at first sight, and I really can't remember the reason why we went out to the movies on the first place, but what I know is that after that day everything changed. 

I am really sceptic when it comes to love, cause I promised myself I would never feel again the unbearable pain of love rejection. He tried to hold my hand that day, I didn't let him (didn't feel right), the second time I saw him he tried to kiss me (didn't let him again).. that day wasn't even a date, we just saw each other casually on the street. So after that he stopped texting me.. I'm guessing he didn't like that conservative part about me... but come one.. it was only two times.. when a guy really likes you he makes an effort to see you again and earn your trust, your kisses.. 

So I realized the thing women never want to : "" he just wasn't that into me"".. and it was okay I was really good when it came to protect my heart.. but what I didn't know was this time I wouldn't be able to do so. I kept seeing him randomly and occasionally (cause I forgot to mention an important fact of the story: WE WORK TOGETHER). 

When we see each other at work it gets random at first, but at the end he keeps flirting with me.. it is so CONFUSING! Never been in this situation before, don't know how to react... And you guys don't need to tell me what I already now.. **HE DOES NOT WANT ANYTHING SERIOUS AND HE IS NOT THAT INTO ME**... so... why does he keep doing that? why does he keep trying to kiss me when none is looking? why does he touches my hands on purpose just to hold them for a short amount of time?

POST: We have been long distance after almost a year of being together. Once we began long distance the relationship became ten times harder and I began to question myself if I could do this. 

This led to many many fights and every single one hurt my girlfriend more and more until last night when I poured my heart and realized so many things about myself, I realized how selfish I was to her. But it was too late, she said that she was just too hurt and couldn't be with me anymore. 

This broke my heart because the only person to blame is myself. I told her I'd wait and I'd have to prove to her that I am going to do this. I don't want to go out on weekends, I don't want to and meet women all I want to do is get on Skype lay in bed and read to her until she falls asleep. Why the fuck couldn't I have just done that before without pushing her away so far away. I was just so insecure about our relationship while she was just so sure about her feelings and about herself. I felt like she was falling from a cliff and I couldn't grab and pull her back.

TITLE: Cat getting hot spots.

POST: Hey all. I'm calling all cat nutrition experts. 

My 7 year old orange shorthair developed a hot spot on her neck. Before I knew what a hot spot even was there was a running joke about how she would not know when to stop rubbing her head on stuff because she'd sometimes rub herself into a little scab. 

As far as I can remember she always would over do rubbing her head like that. It wasn't until recently she started rubbing that spot on her neck like that. 

We went to the vet to get her checked out. When I saw what she had done to herself I freaked the hell out. they sent us home with an ointment.

I didn't know that certain foods could cause a cat to start getting really itchy spots on them like that.

We have two cats. The 7 year old and a 13 year old. The 13 year old had never had any problems like this. I suspect that it has something to do with the 7 year old being a little undersized, maybe a runt. (she was also pretty undernourished when I found her 6 or so years ago trying to cross a busy street. Perhaps not the brightest.)

We feed both of our girls friskies prime fillets. mostly turkey or beef. They don't like fish too much. We used to feed them fancy feast but seemingly out of no where both of them decided they didn't want to eat it any more. We have meow mix hairball control dry food out for them. I feel like we've always fed them meow mix. 

Oh! Another thing. The two girls fight a bunch. It's never anything too out of control. They just both seem to love the same square of living room. When it gets too rough they usually cut it out or i'll intervene with a spray bottle of water. The older cat doesn't have her front claws but the younger one does. As a result the older one will nuzzle the younger cat to get her to cut it out. Could that be the reason? If so why the spots on the her ears. I've never seen the older cat go after those spots when they are playing. Again, the older cat hasn't had any issues like this. 

Anyway,

TL;DR:",  7 year old orange shorthair developed a hot spot on her neck. Vet sent us home with ointment. Possibly related to under nutrition. Two cats fight a lot. Possibly why the older cat has hot spots.,  does any one have any information on either of these foods causing a reaction like this? Could it be the two cats playing too rough?

TITLE: Me [25/M] dealing with a group of friends ranging 19-24

POST: Hello there, r/Relationships,

I've got kind of a serious question that has been more or less wrecking my life in the last few weeks. I guess I'll start out with a quick back story. Started a study abroad program in January in Tokyo and have met some of the most wonderful people during the first 3 months of the program. We got along just fine and became fast friends. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, half the group has left while the remaining half is still here.

Here's the problem. While I had an interest in one or two girls in the group [ages 23-24] that had remained, it seems that their interests are on the other guys. Now, I never really voiced my interests for the sake of maintaining the status quo of the group, but I knew things were going on. I wanted to give them their space, but because of it, I've grown resentful.

As a result, I feel that they've become more exclusive to themselves and as such, I've told one of the people that I felt really close to my troubles. He says that no, it's not that they're trying to exclude me and that it's all in my head. There shouldn't be any problems between me and the group, but yet I still have that weird feeling that I shouldn't be treading in this territory. They do things on their own and yet, I feel that I'm more or less put on the wayside.

TL;DR:","  Started a study abroad program, met some amazing people, half of the group left, group has become more exclusive to themselves and I feel that I'm being excluded. What should I do?",  Frustrated that I couldn't get my feelings out and now feel weird trying to get back into the group. How would I go about mending these bonds?

Long story short, my husband of 1 month now, have been together 6 years. We have been through many ups and downs, and have been very open with each other and have really grown in our relationship. Which is a big reason why we got married.

A few days ago I found naked pictures of a girl he used to work with on his phone. They were from 2 years ago, and the date suggested about 3 months before he proposed to me.

First I know it was stupid of me to even be looking on his phone, though I wasn't looking for him cheating. Just something that is irrelevant to this problem now. But feel free to speak openly about this to me as well.

Second, I have confronted him and he has told me in phases about what happened. Though my concern is that he's not being fully honest with me or him self, because he's answered a lot of my questions with something like ""I'm not sure, it was a long time ago"" or ""To the best of my knowledge, this is what happened."" He said it was a time in our relationship when he wasn't sure where we were going, and we weren't really having a lot sex. But honestly, he never clued me in on that time in our relationship much, especially since he proposed only months later. He said he knew it was wrong immediately and feels so guilty. But he kept those pictures, and I know he never stopped his friendship with her. 

Now we're only a month into our marriage, and I'm worried about how we're going to deal with this...how I'm going to deal with this!

TL;DR:",  Husband of 1 month admitted to sexting with an old co-worker of his before we got engaged. I'm worried about how we're going to deal with this and how our marriage is going to be affected.,"  I just need help deciding if working through this is the right thing, and if so, need good advice on how. If not, need advice on how to end it."

TITLE: Reddit, what is the weirdest thing you have seen on the subway?

POST: I got the idea from another thread in here where someone claimed that the NYC subway wasn't that bad. One day, I was headed into the city to go see one of my favorite punk bands at the time. In order to get to the venue, we had to take a train downtown. While some of my friends and I were sitting on a train, I hear a woman scream and a group of people immediately walk towards the other side of the train with looks of disgust. Now, I focus my head to see what could be so bad, and it's a homeless guy. Someone else on the train is helping him on and yelling ""this is a human being, i was like this man once, etc."" I couldn't figure out why these people would react this way towards a homeless person. Out of nowhere my friend yells ""fuck this"" and runs off the train. That is when the smell of puss and infection hits me like a cockslap from Zeus. The man's foot was swollen to the size of a basketball and discolored if not rotting. Now, besides the smell and the sight, what really does it is the fact that something in his foot has popped and he is leaving a heavy trail of some brownish blood all over the train.

TL;DR:","  While on a NYC Subway train, I witness a homeless man's foot swelling up and leaving a trail of brownish blood all over the train. What is the weirdest thing you have seen on the NYC Subway?",  Went to the city. Got on train. Man had one foot the size of a basketball that stunk of infection and bled on everything.

TITLE: I [19F] have no idea how to read the situation with guys I like, or even ones I want to be friends with

POST: I just became a university student a couple months ago, and due to distance, my long term boyfriend of 2 years and I broke up. I'm pretty introverted, so he was my only friend, and he held a grudge. So here I am, introverted and alone in a STEM school which is guy-dominant, and I don't know how to interact with them. I really think it would be good for me to get out there again, but I've never been good at making friends, let alone the whole dating scene.

I joined a few clubs at the beginning of last semester, and met a group of three guy friends[all 20/M] who live together, and do everything together. I feel comfortable enough around them now, but still get nervous even asking them to hang out, because I get paranoid that I'm a nuisance. I want to become closer friends with all of them, but don't know how to go about doing that.

In particular, one of them I can't help being drawn to. He's extremely passionate, and talented, and just amazing to talk to, and he and I are a lot alike. He's not the kind of guy I usually go for, and I'm not sure what it is about him that makes him stick in my mind so much, but I can't help thinking about him. 

My problem is that he also got out of a long term relationship recently, I don't know how to get him alone without scaring him off, and I'm pretty sure he just sees me as one of the guys. One minute he'll be really honest, and be having a pretty deep conversation with me, and the next, he's laughing it up about some joke he made at my expense. 

Any advice at all would make me very happy.

TL;DR:","  Introverted university student, no idea how to interact with guys I like, especially one who just got out of a long term relationship. Need advice on how to get him alone without scaring him off.","  I'm completely stupid and shy when it comes to getting closer to people both romantically and non-romantically and need help, please"

TITLE: My ex-girlfriend [21] broke up with me a few weeks ago, yet still wants to hangout with me [22] every day.

POST: Hey all, I just recently was on the receiving end of my first breakup. After about five months I was told the reasoning was chemistry and her not being over her old boyfriend. The breakup wasn't dramatic, and she moved out shortly thereafter; however, she still keeps in contact with me via text in the mornings / nights, and I see her at least once or twice a day. She knows full well how I feel about her, and how I am still in love with her, but I can't tell if she's flipped the switch and ""friendzoned"" me that quickly or not.

I'm all for giving her space to do her own thing, and figure out her own issues... however, I can't help but feel a sting whenever we part without so much as a hug. Being the schlep that I am, I would still do anything for her and keep her as company for as long as possible (unless she started to date somebody else).

I guess I would just like to know if it's possible to rekindle the romance, or if she is just looking for the chase again.

TL;DR:","  Ex-girlfriend broke up with me, yet still wants to hangout with me every day.

TITLE: My brother thinks entitled to a car

POST: He's been asking for a car from my parents, punching and making holes on the walls for years. Problem is, we can't afford one right now. We're struggling to pay bills. If he wanted a car, he should work for it. In the past month, my mom took a house keeping job just to keep up with day-to-day living. Instead, she poured all that money to get a car. The car was a non-op, used car (it ran, it just didn't have smog clearance yet, so we can't get it registered and insured yet). It's been a week sitting in our garage. Today, he just raised voice on mom telling her to shut her mouth because she's not letting him use the used car. My mom's reasoning was it's uninsured and failed smog test but he kept arguing that he won't get caught or get in trouble. Again, my mom can't afford to fix it yet. She just bought the car a week ago! He said he's been walking for miles and riding the bus just to get to school but not really. He gets dropped to school M-F everyday, and picked up from his friends house after school (3-4 of the 5 days). He doesn't realize my mom looking up for him and all he does is raise his voice and argue his false points. He thinks he's entitled to a car because he's 17.

He thinks it's bad. I'm 21, have a job, and still does not own a car. I go to a community college and wake up at 4AM, ride 2-3 buses just to get to school. Going back home is another 2-3 buses. All the money that I earn, I pay the house bills.

TL;DR:","  My brother thinks he's entitled to a car because he's 17. We can't afford one right now. He raises his voice and arguments his false points.

TITLE: Reddit: What Queued Your Worst ""Late to the Party"" Feeling?

POST: I'm a twenty-four year old white male and this past Summer met my father for the first time as an adult; from him, I learned my father was addicted to methamphetamines during the period he impregnated my mother, probably until he left our lives. She herself was addicted to crack during the whole 9month period and evidently was until I was around seventeen. We've oft been isolated by people who got to know my mother; family members, people who she gets to be friends with, neighbors, and were shunned due to this and I never really understood why.
She's never had close friends, relationships, rarely had let me out of the house, would get mad if I tried speaking with her, barely ate and thus had barely food in the house. I was made to follow this path.
She is such a sweet person, I never knew anything was off with all of this and even though I have been out of the house since nineteen, it took two years to start seeing how exactly all of that was bad and the adverse effects it had on my person. 
I recall a time making fun of crack babies in high school; looks like the jokes on me, hurr hurr.
Also, since this revelation I have been much more tolerant of people who have been intentionally indoctrinated considering my unintentional indoctrination. It's hard to know more than what you know sometimes.

POST: In recruit training, SanDiego, 2 males in my platoon were found giving/receiving oral to each other intentionally during our shower time.  Whether the two were legitimately homosexual or not is out of the question because there was no discreetness about the act whatsoever.  We had 3 shower rooms and they had left a couple minutes before everyone else to take their shower.  Fastforward a couple of minutes and there out in the open are the two guys giving each other fellatio for everyone to see.  Here is the best part about it all...instead of kicking the 2 out of the Marine Corps like they wanted...The drill instructor told them that they were both getting a 1 way ticket into the navy where they could perform these kind of acts where it is deemed normal.....(this is what was said, not in any way a hit to the navy).

So Reddit, do you have any similar stories that you have heard of or personally saw?

So anyways. The last time we had sex is 4 days ago. And he says we only had ""good sex"" twice since 2 weeks.
I really am sorry for it but there's just no feeling of having sex sometimes. He keeps asking me why I couldn't just let him try to make me horny but it's not about the being horny part it's about that I don't even want to be horny.
We had two fights about it since yesterday cause he thinks I'm controlling our sex life which is kind of true but what's so bad about doing what I feel like and telling him if I don't want something. 
He was yelling at me and I kept saying that I'm sorry but apparently he didn't hear it.
He said he wouldn't even want it anymore and just left the house.
I was planning on having sex with him, just like yesterday, but not like this, it just makes me want to leave.
Help.

TITLE: Reddit, I have a totally irrational fear... How do I pull myself out?

POST: I have this fear of being murdered, in my own home, but it goes well beyond that. It all started when my car was broken into, in my own drive way. My laptop, radar detector, GPS, system, amp & sub were all taken from my car in the middle of the night. I really felt stupid for leaving my things in my car, in plain view. Following the incident, I would go outside on the back porch to smoke and almost immediately have a panic attack. I'm usually up until 4 - 5AM, so it was quite dark when I'd go out. One of my dogs would usually go out with me and she would bark at shadows. That's what triggered it. Even with every landscape light & the lights from my porch on, I'd panic at the thought of what I couldn't see beyond the lit areas. I'd race inside, usually throwing my cigarette to the ground while flailing my arms about & slam the door. From that point on, I'd have to constantly make sure the doors were locked. Every light in my house had to be on. I'd make sure my dogs are awake & alert. I'd usually wake the next morning in the recliner in my bedroom, sometimes with a knife (which I now sleep with close by). 

*NOW*, I have quit smoking. I thought that would help and it did for a few days. Unfortunately, I still freak out, every single night. I cannot be home at night without every light in my house on, in a complete panic. It's even gotten to the point that I grab all four of my dogs & stay at a friends house quite frequently. Should I seek therapy for something like this? Any home remedies for curing this kind of fear?

TITLE: From a 678 to a 615 in six weeks?

POST: I recently shopped around and went to a dealership to see what kind of financing I could get for a vehicle on their lot that I really liked and thought I could get a good deal out of. I requested a $10,000 loan.

The way my credit was at the time, I had 100% on time payments with a 12 month credit history of payments, I also had a new line from Best Buy credit that has been going two months now. Prior to this loan request, I had a 678 score. 

Shortly after talking with the dealer and running my credit, I decide that I'm not financially set enough to be buying a car. To add insult to injury, I find out over the next couple weeks that they contacted 18 various banks and credit unions for financing...all denying my loan. I would read each letter stating the reasons for denial and seeing my score drop... 658...647...630...625...and now finally 615 where I'm at the end of the inquiries. During this time, I managed to miss ONE payment from Best Buy which resulted in a single interest charge and double payment that I caught up on the next month. I am current on the payment of that now. 

I also applied for a credit card and I believe I was approved (since it was through my current bank) and I should be receiving one next week.

TL;DR:","  Went to dealership to get financing, requested a $10,000 loan, 18 different banks and credit unions denied my loan, missed one payment, applied for credit card and should be receiving one soon.",  I have 18 hard inquiries from a car loan and one late payment.

TITLE: [16/f] deciding whether to stay at home unhappily or risk living with boyfriend (19/m) which might not be the best financially/might cause parents emotional pain

POST: Me and boyfriend (Lets call him R) have been together almost 2 years and I am seriously planning on moving in with him when I turn 18. 
BUT, I was raised in a Christian home and dont want my Christian mom to feel like a failure with me moving in (and of course breaking the marital sex rule) being not very Christian-like. It hurt my mom when both my older sisters moved out at 18, but they were different situations. They both disliked my mom because of spoiled and entitled personalities even though my mom did everything they could to give them a good life. So my mom feels like a failure with both kids hating them when they moved out and one of them heavily getting into drugs right before she moved out. I have a theory that she views me and my younger brother by two years as the good, successful kids, since we were from her current husband and not her asshole ex-husband. And we didn't get pregnant at 18 or get into drugs.
I have no hard feelings towards both of my parents, I just want to become independent and live with R. Thats where I'd feel happiest and if this didn't go through then I'd feel resent towards my parents for holding me back. 
For backstory, R wants to be a psychologist and is getting his Associates degree in accounting so while going to school for psychology will earn good money as an accountant. He's mature, logical and understandable. I don't think there's any risk in that area. He's a freshman in community college now, hes not a bum.
His mom I've talked to this about and she made a goo point saying ""If you keep trying to make them happy instead of *myself* happy then I'll never be truly happy.
*I also haven't told my parents about my plans and they think I'm staying at home through college.
But this is a huge decision and I want as many opinions as possible. I've asked teachers, my two cleaned up older siblings and R's mom. But you can never have too many second opinions on a serious and life changing decision.

TL;DR:","  Moving in with boyfriend of 2 years, raised in Christian home, don't want Christian mom to feel like failure with me moving in. Should I stay at home or risk living with boyfriend which might not be the best financially?","  Choosing between moving out with responsible boyfriend but risk mother feeling like a failure with teaching me morals *or* staying at home, financially safe, but unhappy and resentful towards parents."

TITLE: Reddit, my mother stole money from me to ruin my family. What do I do?

POST: Repost because the last one got caught in the spam filter.

So, in February of 2010 when I was 16-17, I was the victim of a screwup at the pharmacy, which landed me in the hospital for about 4 days. I received a decent amount of money for a settlement for the screwup, and it was placed in a bank account with my mom's name on it, to be transfered to me when I turned 18. Starting in January, before my 18th birthday in March, my mother started behaving very nastily towards my father, and eventually filed a restraining order, saying he had become ""violent,"" and ""kicked in her door."" I never saw any of this. He never raised a hand towards her, even though they argued frequently. He had been sleeping in the garage in the winter to avoid upsetting her, and was asking to sleep in the house. Turns out, she withdrew almost $5000 from my settlement money, to be used for college, to put a down payment on a divorce lawyer the next Monday. Now she's saying to the court that it was a ""loan,"" even though I wasn't even aware of it until months later. I think I'm going to press charges, but I figured I'd ask what everyone else thinks. Theres a lot more to the story I'm probably missing, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

But, he doesn't feel the same way, and admits to being afraid to think that way because he's graduating at the end of the year and most likely will be leaving me.

I've had guys say they love me and then take it back, so I appreciate his honesty. Unfortunately, the logical part of my head doesn't control my tear ducts.

Admittedly, I really had my hopes up that he'd be saying ""I love you"" soon. I was looking for something to differentiate me from the other girls he knows. My boyfriend has a lot of female friends, and he's extremely affectionate with all of them. He practically dates them all  - takes them on one-on-one outings and stays up all night with them when  they're going through a rough time. He's a good friend, and I love that about him.

But on the other hand, I feel like the only thing that sets me apart from his friends is that he fucks me. And that doesn't feel so great.

She doesn't seem to trust me by what she says, and we're really different from each other I feel. She's said things like ""I see us lasting a long time"" and stuff like that but yeah. We don't really fight but I feel she's just kind of all over the place as a person. We had an off and on ""thing"" 2 months before we got together. 

She seems pretty happy with us but I'm unsure if I am. She keeps saying things like how she really loves me, and how she think I'm ""the one"" and stuff like that. She's also a little clingy, texts me a little too much. Sometimes her actions and what she says are little too much,(talks too much) gives me this ""woah calm down"" feeling inside. We had sex. (Yes I know I'm too young don't have to tell me) But this is only because she really really wanted to. I've done it with someone else already but she was a virgin. I'm a little worried that this will complicate things, even though we talked about it and how it wouldn't stop us from breaking up if something went wrong.

Now the other part...I realized I still have feelings for another girl that I liked before I dated this girl, and she likes me as well but she's also in a relationship, her relationship is going to end soon though.

POST: My GF flew off at me the other week.

I asked her if she was texting another guy and me asking this question almost made her breakup with me.

The reason I thought she might be is that she has suspicious phone activity. She uses it a lot when I'm not in the same room and quickly stops what she's doing when I come in, she recently started putting it on total silent when she comes home and she leaves her phone screen side down. This has only been happening past couple of months. Put this with the fact she has never acknowledged my existence in a public sense in anyway in 2 years and I felt a bit sus.

When I asked her if something fishy is going on she exploded and said I don't trust her etc etc went to stay at a friends house, and pretty much implied we were breaking up.

Now I feel if I have a problem with something or if I am a bit suspicious I cannot ask about it or she will instantly dump me.

Is it fair? I feel like I should be able to talk about what's bothering me. Am I too insecure with asking about her phone habits?

TITLE: Boyfriend (M24) keeps calling me (F19) his life partner. 2 year relationship, I don't feel the same way.

POST: So basically my boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and he keeps calling me his life partner. He believes we will be married someday and would totally be okay with being engaged and living together right now. 

I, on the other hand, don't really plan on him being my ""forever"" due to multiple reasons (money, he's very critical, insecure) so it makes me very uncomfortable when he says this. However, it would start a huge endless argument if I ever brought this up to him so it's better to leave it alone. 

My problem though is that I don't want to waste his time when I don't plan on this lasting forever, but I also don't want to break up right now because we have a great relationship and it's a nice thing for the time being. 

Another wrench to throw in is that he has absolutely no friends besides me. This puts a lot of pressure on me to constantly be there for him and be his only source of happiness, entertainment, and companionship. This sometimes makes me feel trapped in our relationship which is a feeling I really don't like. I don't like that feeling since I'm only 19 and have been in this relationship and one before this meaning I have always been in a relationship ever since I was 16. Sometimes I get curious about being single but I feel like I can't even consider leaving him when I'm his only source of friendship. 

I'm not suggesting I want to end our relationship. But I don't like the feeling that I basically couldn't if I wanted to. Anyone else had a similar situation or general advice for how to continue in a relationship where each partner has different expectations or if it should continue at all?

TITLE: Girl [21 F] that I [23 M] have been casually seeing for a while slept with another guy, and I have no clue what my next move should be

POST: A bit of backstory: I've been with this girl for around 5 months. It started out as a purely physical thing where we'd just hook up on a regular basis then go our separate ways, but both of us wanted to keep it exclusive. Lately we've been spending more time together and it's been getting a bit more serious, but nothing drastic. I do enjoy spending time with her though if we're being totally honest.

Jump forward to last night, we're at the bar with all our friends, and this guy she used to have a bit of a fling with is there. She's drunk, giving him a little too much attention, and I can see that he's trying to get laid. So, being the aggressively jealous person that I am, I freak out & yell, we get into a big argument, I say something hateful to the guy, and I storm out in a jealous rage.

This morning, she tells me that she ended up getting blackout drunk and they hooked up. Something about how she practically had to be carried home, and she woke up naked with the guy. She seems remorseful though, and judging from the story she gave me, it sounds like he really took advantage of her drunkenness. But I don't know what actually happened, and I probably never will. Which really makes me think I should've knocked that son of a bitch out when I had a chance, but that's life I guess.

It still makes my blood boil when I think of it though, and due to the fact that our relationship isn't all that serious, I don't know if I should cut ties, or try to put it behind us, because to be honest, the sex is amazing, and I don't think this is going to happen again. But on the other hand, our one rule was that we keep it exclusive, and she broke it. I kind of have a tendency to torture myself with this type of thing as well, so my willingness to ""work it out"" might just be my inner masochist talking. Feedback would be great because I'm feeling pretty torn.

TITLE: My friend (20M) have a problem with a girl (20F)

POST: I'm currently trying to help him move on from her.

Long story short, my friend met a girl in uni. They talked a bit before but only on FB (talked a bit in class also but that's about it). They went on to being in different classes due to one of them failing a year. She told him on FB that she'll hang out with him. After a while she met her current BF. Now my friend says that it's not fair that she gave her BF a chance before him even though she hasn't met either one of them. They argued about it a bit. She blocked him and unblock him after a while to help him move on.

Now it has been more than a year, and he still tries to message her in whatever way possible, to the point of harassment. She would open up accounts under her name, open up other accounts, post pictures of himself and tag her in it, etc. She has contacted the police twice, and the police has talked to him twice, warning him but he doesn't care. He has specifically said he doesn't care about going to jail, as long as she will explain why she didn't give him a chance. The police also warned that he'll be kicked out of school, but he doesn't care.

I've been trying to talk to him but his mind is locked onto this, and he said it'll basically continue until she gives him a reply to why, which she has multiple times, but he thinks she's not being truthful. I'm not sure how to help him move on, as he clearly cant and I don't want him to get kicked out of school/going to jail because of a girl..

TL;DR:","  Friend has a problem with girl, she gave him a chance before him even though she hasn't met either one of them. It's been more than a year and he still harasses her.

TITLE: Me [17 M] with my gf [17 F] of eight months broke up the other day because of her dad found out we had sex

POST: Alright, well this Sunday, the 27, I picked my girlfriend up to take to my house. Halfway there she receives and call from her mom and I have tot take her home. I didn't know what it was about, so I drop her off and take her home. I get back to my house and her father texted me that based on some information he had received, he didn't want me to see his daughter anymore. I'm here think, ""Well f***."" 

I call my gf later to see what happened. It turns out that her parents snooped around her room and read the messages off of her iPod (which receive her texts as well as her phone). We were talking about how we had sex and yada-yada. So her parents yelled at her and then her dad texted me that. 

Yesterday we officially broke-up because I argued with her father about the whole scenario (I know, stupid me) because I couldn't handle how he didn't see me right for his daughter just because we had sex. So she ended it because it was between me or her father. 

Since then we've still been talking and there's a lot of feelings going around - neither of us want our relationship to be over. How do I convince her parents that we should continue dating? I know I could get over her but I really don't want that to happen. A lot of stuff happens in eight months.. I honestly think I love her, but maybe I'm just young. 

Seriously though, can anyone help me with how I should handle this situation? I really want to stay with her.

TITLE: I Want to Move Out of State?

POST: Hello everyone. So I am looking to move out of Pennsylvania. I've lived here my whole life. I'm 24 now. Have a job I don't like much. There's not many good jobs around here. I don't have many friends, and lack family (I have one best friend) , so nothing is keeping me here anymore. I want to get a fresh start in a new area, where the people are friendly, plenty of job opportunities, and the weather is warm. I was going to go to school for health information management. The program is going to take probably a year to finish and I don't know if I can stay at my current job for that long. However, I don't think it's wise moving out of state with only having data entry and warehouse experience. The states that I was recommended were Texas, North Carolina, and Arizona.

Should I stick it out with my job until I finish school? Have you ever moved out of state because you were unhappy? Was the grass greener on the other side? Please share your experiences =)

TITLE: I have social anxiety and am doing terribly in interviews. What can i do to improve this?

POST: This has been happening to me a lot lately. I'll get an interview, and the person who has seen my resume tells me right off it looks like my experience is a great match for the position, before we even start. 

(I'm just applying for customer service jobs for the most part, and my resume includes a lot of that, plus some lower management in a customer service job)

Anyway, I do just fine with actual customer service, for some odd reason. 

Outside of work, i don't really have a social life. I'm perfectly comfortable interacting with friends through text, but i rarely see any in person. When i do, i get a bit weird, but that's around people i'm friends with. 

Job interviews though... My mind goes blank. I try to mitigate this problem by researching what the particular company i'm working with uses for interview questions, and preparing and practicing my answers ahead of time. This doesn't work. My mind goes entirely blank, i stumble over words, it's pathetic, and every single time someone has indicated that they definitely want me to work for them based on my resume, by the end of the interview they've changed their mind. 

What can i do about this? I don't have the luxury to just keep practicing and get better, since interviews don't come around that often and i need to actually get a job fairly soon because i'm currently without an income (due to moving to a new area and taking a seasonal job which ended)

TITLE: Reddit, am I being unreasonable about situation with friends staying in my house?

POST: So here's the background.  My parents moved out of the country for business (temporary) and left me to live in the house to take care of it.  It's a big house and lonely alone, so I asked if my friends could move in with me.  My parents agreed to friends A and B, but were hesitant about also allowing friends C and D because they did not want that many people living there.  All those friends lived together before, so A and B did not want to ditch C and D.  I managed to convince my parents, and they said fine, but that they would charge everyone $300/mo as rent (which basically just covers utilities).

About 2 months ago, friend A's brother comes over without A telling anyone.  I assumed it was just for a few days, but a few weeks later he was still there sleeping on the couch the whole time.  I asked A and he said he was only staying for the hockey games.  At this point my parents figured out he was here (my brother told them) and were upset that no one asked them if someone else could live there.  I told them the situation and they said fine.  

It is now 3 weeks after the Stanley Cup finals, and he is still here.  My parents are pissed that he is still here and with no definite plans on when he is moving out.  I talked to my friend about it, and he thinks my parents are being unreasonable.  Meanwhile, I'm placed in the middle of it all and am stressing out over the fact that I'm taking shit for this from both sides.  So reddit, am I being unreasonable about this?  Is there a better way I can explain this to him so he gets it?

POST: Hello,

She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation/kisses/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation? She honestly does nothing wrong and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that she does for me. I'm just not entirely happy. Any advice?

TITLE: TIFU by trying to smell lube out of curiosity

POST: It began when my uncle asked me to help redecorate the house with the new furniture he got from his friend. Being the good nephew I am, I happily obliged.

Now here's where trouble begins. The furniture my uncle's friends gave to us, still had a lot of stuff in them (mostly clothes). So we had to take out the clothes and put them in garbage bags in order for us to use and carry them. Out of sheer luck, I found a bottle of lube.

The labelling on the lube said ""**strawberry flavor**"". I don't have much experience with sexual things and so I got really curious. I wanted to smell the lube. Yes you read that right. **I WANTED ITS FRUITY SMELL IN MY NOSTRILS**.

Little did I know that water-based lube actually has a very watery-like viscosity. Despite it clearly saying that, I still thought it had a lotion-like viscosity. So opened the cap and tried to squirt a bit into my hand.

Instead, a grand deluge of lube came down all over my body and the furniture--the fruity smell pervasive throughout the vicinity. As this was happening, my entire family stood and watched with mixed expressions of horror and confusion. I told them to relax as it was only water-based lube but my clarification only added to their horror.

They then asked, ""Why did you open it?"" to which I replied nonchalantly, ""I just wanted to smell it.""

TL;DR:","  Tried to smell lube out of curiosity, water-based lube came out all over me and furniture, family watched in horror.",  Found lube while cleaning out new furniture. Got curious and tried to smell it. Instead spilled it all over myself in front of my family.

TITLE: A good friend [17 M] became very religious, I [18 M] don't know how to handle it

POST: Hello /r/relationships,
I had a few conversations over the last week with a very good friend of mine that I know for 8 years now. He's an Arab, I'm a Turk.

He always was a chill guy. We would do everything together that was funny, like literally everything. We would go out to smoke waterpipe with another friend. We would talk about anything, we would talk about girls, make fun of things that we would all find funny.

He has changed now, though. No more smoking waterpipe, no more trying to have sex before marriage, no more dating girls as it seems. He talks about why all women should wear scarfs and why they should be capped everywhere on the body. He tells me to stop consuming alcohol. He tells me to stop running after that one girl and rather go learn. He tells me to stop smoking.

He's still kind of chill and responds quiete normally when I ask him about that girl I want to date and get closer to but he also said that if he was me, he'd stop having contact.

He even sent me a video about the Islam and what you should do. I friendly said 'No' and also told him that I respect him for the way he thinks if he thinks that it's the right way but I know for a fact that I won't change and that I'll also go out to smoke with another friend later today.

It's still very strange how he has changed so quick. We would have smoked together like 1-2 months ago and now he just became like that. I don't know how to handle his behaviour. I mean, I don't really think he's going to become an extremist but he seems to be very bullheaded when it comes to religion.

Like I said, I'm a Turk but I take it all easy and also consider continuing to smoke, consume alcohol and having sex before marriage because it's and would all be just part of my life.

Thanks for reading.

I wouldn't be apposed to going with her to a party because she will do it regardless and I'd feel safer being able to be there. 
The catch is my unit deploys at the end of the year for 10 months.

Am I just extremely paranoid. Or am I alright in my concerns. Again I don't know how the college life is I just hear stories from frat guys I work with about the number of drunk girls they have slept with at these parties.

POST: I am 21F and my boyfriend is 22M. We've been dating for about 9 months now but have been friends for 4+ years. I'm his first girlfriend. 

In my eyes, our relationship is like a wonderful dream. I've been in a long term relationship before (2 years) and it ended fairly amicable, but I know how shitty dating can be. We have so much in common, share wonderful memories and crack up together. We are in love. I'm cynical when it comes to relationships because I've experienced failure after failure, not to mention my parents are divorced. 

We argue, a lot. Over almost anything. Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day. This taints the better part of our relationship, but not enough for either of us to want to end it. Although, we did break up about 5 months ago for maybe a week. (It was a drunken break up)

If I were to describe our relationship from his point of view, you all would probably think I was a psycho. I'm clingy and have a temper. I can be too sensitive and crave attention. Honestly, I hate it, and he knows I hate it. Change isn't easy to come by, and there are some emotional/depression/self esteem issues I should work out on my own.

I guess my question is, how can I change my attitude to be a better girlfriend? Or should we break up for a while so I don't feel so attached to him? I see so much potential in our future together and love him dearly. I just want to make the right choices.

He entered into a relationship with someone else following that, which ended in January.

We both make enough money to make ends meet. With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. 

Well, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of ""breaking his fucking hand"" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend on the spot told him he is leaving in 2 weeks.

We also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team.

POST: My father used to live in Chicago. He owned a furniture store. There was a large business across the street, and the business didn't have very good parking. So, this one employee would always park in my father's parking lot.

My father asked him everyday for a week to please stop parking there, because it took parking spots away from his customers.

On the first 4 days the guy says ""yah, sure. I won't park here.""

On the 5th day, the guy says, ""Fuck off! This is a free country!""

So, my dad waits for the guy to park in his lot again the following Monday.

The guy parks in my father's parking lot, flips him off, and then storms to the business across the street.

So, my father being the natural badass he was, sprays water all over the car. Keep in mind this is in CHICAGO. In the FUCKING WINTER.

When the guy comes out from work a few hours later, he finds my dad standing there with a hose, smoking a cigarette, with the douchebag's car almost completely frozen.

The guy flips his shit and tells my dad he's calling the cops, and my father just says nonchalantly ""It's a free country, isn't it?"".

The douchebag's car was frozen in my father's parking lot for the rest of the winter. It was actually in the news, but I can't seem to find it on the internet, considering it happened in like the 60's.

Needless to say, the following spring, the guy didn't park his car in my father's parking lot.

TL;DR:","  My dad asked a guy to stop parking in his parking lot, douchebag flips him off, dad sprays water all over his car, car stays frozen for the rest of winter.","  Guy parks his car in my father's parking lot and refuses to stop doing it, so my father turns the car into an icecube."

TITLE: I [M 21] dont know how to convey to a girl that I like her and want more than a friendship.

POST: Basically my issue is that I'm terrible at telling someone I'm interested in them in ways more than a friend. I'm not sure what it is or why it happens per say, but I just cannot break that barrier. I'm great at forming long lasting friendships but they form due to my interest in the girl as more than friends. 

As stupid as it sounds, I quite literally get ""stuck"" in the ""friendzone"" as a result of my own inability to act on my feelings and tell the other party I am interested in more ways than just friendship. 

Lately I've been wondering if this is just something I personally deal with or if its common. Any help/advice/tips/changes I can make to myself/my perception would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: I don't feel like my wife [32/f] can be emotionally intimate with me [32/m]. Can we get there? If so, how?

POST: I'm [32/m] a pretty intimate person with my friends, strangers, and family. I tend to overshare easily, introspect often, and have no problem connecting with other people who are like me very quickly and on a deep level. 

Unfortunately, that doesn't include my wife [32/f]. She comes from a closed family and doesn't easily open up. This manifests itself in all aspects of her life. She's wary of sharing details with strangers, tends to talk about basic things with me, and is quite bored/ uninterested in sex. But most of all, I have been nagged for years by the feeling that we don't have a ""spark"" - an emotional connection that makes me want to do everything for her. 

I have got to the point where what we have feels increasingly like a friendship rather than a deep emotional relationship. I have suggested that I'm not willing to be in a relationship that's not fulfilling emotionally and have told her that I have considered a separation. 

Our therapist thinks that my wife needs to get better in touch with her sexuality in order to open up more, but I'm not sure. That feels like treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. I think the problem is deeper than just sex. I think she's not able to be intimate emotionally with me. 

I know that stereotypically, it's the guy who can't be emotionally intimate and the girl who seeks it. But I just wonder, is emotional intimacy something that one can ""learn to do""? Or is she just likely to always have a hard time opening up? And finally, is lack of emotional intimacy grounds to divorce someone?

TITLE: The new guy I'm seeing [24/m] likes to sit on the same side of the table as me [20/f]. Weird or cute?

POST: I've been seeing this guy now for about a month or so (note: we're both in our 20s), and when we go out to eat he likes to sit on the same side of the table. Personally, I think it's cute; most of the other guys that I've dated have never done this. When I asked him why he likes to sit on the same side of the table he said he feels its more romantic. However, my friends think it's weird. They say it's normal for being out in a group to sit next to your SO, but not while out to eat alone together. I don't want to be judged at restaurants, but at the same time I don't see what the big deal is. Since this has become somewhat of a debate, I thought I'd ask Reddit! What do you all think? And if you all think it is  weird, how should I explain this to my new man?

TL;DR:","  New guy I'm seeing likes to sit on the same side of the table as me. Friends say its normal for being out in a group to sit next to your SO, but not while out to eat alone.",  dating someone new and not sure if this is a weird thing that they do until my friends made fun of him for it.

TITLE: Don't try to tell me what I can't do.

POST: Earlier this year, I applied for a summer job at my university. It paid decently but allowed me to take classes offline, which I preferred to do, so I went for it. At the same time, a friend of mine (we'll call him Jack) was applying for the job.

Jack became a dick about the job really quickly. Told me I wasn't really qualified (even though I'd been working for the department this job came through for a year) and that my customer service skills were lacking (even though he's seen my boss praise them). Needless to say, I was unhappy and pride mode went into overdrive.

Originally, my plan was to go in and just talk about what I knew and how I could be of service. But his lack of faith made me step it up a notch. I talked to people who had the job in the past. I did research on the people hiring me. I even went to one of the old hirers to get some tips. I was running at 110%.

Interviews end and we find out the results. I got the job. Jack didn't. I went to go talk to him about it but was pulled aside by my friend first, who showed me tweets Jack made saying I was cocky and didn't deserve the job. His reasoning was that I said I wish I knew if I got the job sooner than the date we were expected to, because I just wanted to know so I could get on with my life and stop stressing. He took it as me thinking I got the job.

Knowing about the tweets (I don't use Twitter), I decided to be the lesser man in the situation. At this time, Jack and I were roommates. I walked it and he was quiet. Obviously pissed at me. So I go next door to our friend's room and just shouted ""[FRIEND] I GOT THE JOB! I'M SO EXCITED!"" The walls of our dorm were small. I know he heard me. Walked back in and he just glared at me, but I didn't care. He was a dick.

TL;DR:","  Friend applied for summer job. I was unhappy with the job. He made a series of insensitive and mean comments about me. I shouted ""I GOT THE JOB!"" in our dorm room.","  Friend"" tells me I can't get a certain job that he's applying for. Becomes colossal dick. I get the job. He doesn't.

TITLE: Broke up over a month ago. Still bummed out sometimes. Advice?

POST: Hey guys,
 My SO broke up with me over a month ago. The first week has been hard but I got over it. Problem is that from time to time I still think about it and it really bums me out.

Tonight, I randomly started thinking about the offer of having sex that she gave me 5 days ago to which I declined. I think it was a good decision for the both of us but I might have been a little harsh by saying ""it would be weird to hook up again"". In some twisted way, I might have said that to convince myself I'm over her.

I don't want to get back together because of the long distance, her inability to express emotions, her controlling and her manipulation of the insatisfaction of her own truth but I still have the remainder of some feelings.

POST: BF and I have been dating for a few months. at first we hung out all the time and had sex every day, sometimes twice a day.
For the past two months we've been hanging Out less and less. Probably 1-2x a week max now. Usually if we hang out a second time it's with other people so we don't have sex, meaning that we've been having sex literally once a week.

I can't really handle it. I need it 3-4 days a week ideally. I've told him before that he can hit me up for sex whenever but he has never done that. We also used to have sexy convos by text all the time but now we basically never do. I finally told him some time back that I want to start doing that again and he agreed but we haven't. A few times I've tried to start something naughty over text and he didn't really go for it.

I think the big problem is just not hanging out enough, but I don't think he wants a relationship where we're seeing each other every other day.

POST: Happened just now. I happily skip up the stairs, getting ready to head to bed. I brush my teeth and then feel the sudden urge to pee. I drop trou and let it go, spraying my urine all in the toilet.

Midway through, as I was about to go no hands, I see a spider crawling up the toilet roll. I panic, and jolt backwards, making my urine go all over the place. Then, with my baby maker out, stir dripping my urine, I grab the nearest deadly thing to banish this monstrosity. Air freshner. 

I spray it as it crawls away. Then I lost it. So I pulled my trousers back up and ran. I'll clean the floor when that bastard is dead.

I guess maybe I also don't know how much time I should try to spend with her coz I don't wanna come across as too needy (sounds stupid I know).

TITLE: My [18 M] girlfriend [18 F] of a year and I decided to break up for college about 5 days ago. I think I want to try long distance.

POST: We had been dating for a year, things we're going well but she was always a very flirty person. I developed trust issues because of her being so flirty so when we went to different colleges I pushed for a breakup.

She had been 100% willing to try and make long distance work, but I just couldn't get over my doubts. After a week apart, I realized I would always regret not at least trying to make things work, so I decided I'd try to get her back. I looked up a train route to her university, found a fancy pizza place(it's her favorite), and an ice skating rink in her area.

I called her up that night, spilled my heart out and asked if she'd take me back. I explained that if she said yes, I'd take her on the best date of her life, and if she said no that she should know I'd still feel way better than I had been.

She told me that first I needed to know that the previous Friday she had a drunken one night stand attempting to get over me. She said she regretted it and that it meant nothing, but it crushed me. I thought the worst she could say was no, but this was far worse.

It had literally been days after our breakup, we had been talking the entire time, we had even said that we loved each other the night before. I still love her, but I don't know if I could ever forgive her. I know it wasn't really cheating because we didn't have a title, but it was like the first opportunity she had, she left me behind.

I'm extremely emotional and distraught right now and I don't know what to tell her. Any advice/comments would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: A serious communication problem between me[M21] and my girlfriend[F19]. Am I being an asshole to her?Or something else?

POST: My gf and I have been dating for more than 1.5 year and were friends for more than 3 years. I know a lot about her and she does the same about me. She's a really great person. I could spend the whole day describing how much I like her and how much I am lucky to be with her. But there's an issue in our relationship that I can't get over or keep up with. The issue is her crying during the majority of serious/heated conversations. When we strongly disagree on something and struggle to reach an agreement, I try to calm down, explain my opinion more precisely and ask more questions about the parts that I don't understand about her opinion, but instead of doing the same as I do, she starts getting frustrated, and cries. Reasonably it's the end of the talking, but for her it's not. She asks me to stay and listen to her expressing her frustration about the situation and me not agreeing with her (while she continues crying) instead of calmly discussing the actual problem.  

Yesterday I tried to talk her about her crying problem and how her actions are unproductive in solving anything without hurting her feelings, but I apparently couldn't. She shifted the blame on me and accused me of not caring about her and not want to spend time with her. She stormed out of the house. Now it has been 24 hours since our fight. I called her at least three times but she didn't answer my calls. She probably staying at her parents' house.

Lately, he has been really irritating me lately with his excessive phone use, and it's starting to get under my skin! He is constantly on his phone, either playing his stupid game or on Facebook or God knows what else. 

We have a 1 year old son, and it's gotten to the point where he'll sit on the couch and play on his goddamn phone while my son tries to play with him. And it's ALL night. I am mainly the one playing and taking care of our son. He wasn't this bad before, he would put his phone down while our son was awake, but lately it doesn't matter.. I rarely have my phone. My son is usually throwing it around or it's on the floor. I only really use it when my son is napping or at night when my son is in bed. I DONT want to be one of those parents who's always on their phone, that's why I rarely have it on me when my son is awake. Plus, he's a handful enough already lol.

It's starting to make me wonder if maybe he's doing more than being on FB :-/ 

Ive tried talking to him so many times about it. I've tried to talk to him about it nicely, and not so nicely. I bring up my concerns, but he usually stops for a couple hours or maybe one day, than goes right back. Tonight, I told him to please get off his phone and help with J (our son, he has a really bad cold) and he got mad, tossed his phone and just sat there and was all mad.

TITLE: TIFU by telling a tinder girl she didn't have to shave

POST: Been on tinder lately. Well i matched with a girl that looked decent and had potential. We talked for awhile over the app and then she decided to come over. She had asked me if it was ok that she hadnt shaved, now i am a mature adult so a little bit of hair is no big deal. She shows up, not quite as good as her pictures which is typical, and sounds pretty manly. We hang for a bit and then start getting into it. I reached in and felt bush but that doesnt bother me anyway so everything is good. Eventually her pants come off and now i see why she said she didnt shave. Her pubes ended around her knees and i could smell her. I tried to muster through, trying to avoid hurting her self-esteem by asking her to leave or stopping. I eventually got it up by thinking happy thoughts and covered my jimmie, went for a few minutes and then she wanted to get on top. When she did so i was forced to view the garden and went limp. I said that i had to pee before and thats maybe my problem, it wasn't, so i went into the bathroom and started getting myself hard again, fake flushed the toilet and rushed out to get back in there. Again within a few minutes i was soft again. At this point i decided to tell her that i have this problem if i have jacked off recently and told her i did an hour before to last longer, not an actual problem for me i promise, and told her that i probably wont be able to finish and eventually sent her on her way. Hopped in the shower and cleaned the smell off of me.

I feel awful just leaving her cry herself to sleep ( when it works). I don't want her to have lasting issues because she thinks no one loves her.

Supper: 530-6
Bath: 630-7
Quiet time: books, a tv show 
Teeth, new diaper
Bed: 8-830
Scream: 8-12

Meaning I cannot afford to be late or the person I'm replacing not only gets pissed off but can risk going over on hours (god forbidden the damn place pays them an extra dollar for not clocking out on time). While getting ready with about 10mins until I had to leave I had the need to shit. And I of course made the mistake of deciding to hold it until after work (hence why I'm posting here). 
Luckily this is not a ""I shit my pants"" story, I was able to make it to work and a few hours in my shift with mild discomfort but no huge problems.

TITLE: I [23M] feel disconnected from my three-year-long relationship with my [25F] gf.

POST: I apologise in advance but this will be a long one.

Over the last few months, I feel as though I'm just a passenger in my relationship with my 25 y/o gf.

We have been together for three years, but aren't living together yet - because our job situations don't lend themselves to moving in. We have discussed it and we would like to when the time is right. (I'm in an entry-level position with opportunities to move in six to twelve months time and she has just secured a management job in a retail store.)

I feel disconnected from her because of how she has been when we communicate.

We came back from a two-week vacation a month ago - the holiday was great. But since we have come back it's as if she's not making much of an effort for our relationship.

Beforehand we used to text each other romantic/lovey things all the time. Now if I ask her to send me a 'nice' text she puts something generic or says she doesn't know what to put because she doesn't want to repeat herself - repeating herself would be hard to do because she doesn't say things in the first place.

One example - last night I told her I really wanted to have sex with her and her reply was along the lines of lol really?

Our sex life isn't great. The last time we did was on holiday - so just over a month ago. I saw her at the weekend and we had planned to do stuff but she wanted to watch films instead and then before we realised it I had to take her home.

Should I be worried about this lack of intimacy, or is it a common occurrence in relationships which have been this long?

TL;DR:",  Been with my gf for three years. Relationship is going well but she doesn't seem to make much of an effort for our relationship. I feel disconnected from her. Is this common in long-term relationships?,  GF isn't saying lovey/romantic things as often as she did. Sex life isn't great. Don't know what to do.

TITLE: TIFU by screaming at a random lady on the phone at work

POST: So, this happened yesterday and I didn't have time to write out until now. A little background – I work for a call center that reviews car insurance policies, mostly for the renewals; we do both inbound and outbound calling. I also have the wonderful privilege of working from home. I have 2 cats and a 10-month old German Shepherd/Lab mix puppy, the latter I usually keep with me in my home office to separate her from terrorizing the cats while I'm trying to work.

There I am, working like normal. Pup decides it's a good time to be real annoying and jump everywhere, making dumb puppy noises. Now, all of our calls are recorded and we are ""coached"" on 5 calls per week. These are just weekly reviews of 5 supposedly random calls that we are graded on by our managers. I must do well in order to keep my status of no pants, lay in bed all day work flow, or just keep my job in general (cuss words would get me fired.)

Anyway, here she is going nuts and then an outbound call pops up. I introduce myself and begin explaining the reason for my call, whilst fighting off this 80lb demon dog child, and right as I'm done with my introductory spiel, I press the mute button on my headset and yell, in my angriest dad voice, ""GO LAYYYYYYY DOOOOOOWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!!!!"" She saunters off and I direct my attention back to the call, looking down to press the mute back off and noticing that in fact, the mute button had not been pressed and I just told this random lady to go lay down after asking about her car insurance. I heard an ""Uhhhhh…."" on the line and promptly hung up in my embarrassed and anxious panic after the damage was done.

If this call gets ""randomly"" selected to be reviewed this week, I could be in some deep shit.

TITLE: How do I [19/F] find self-worth in the dull relationship I have with my partner? [25/M]

POST: We've been together for over 2 years, but just lately things haven't been great. As soon as we get home, the TV's on, laptop's are on and we barely speak a word to each other. Without sounding harsh, I feel that I genuinely make all the effort, but he's not so interested.

For example, I'll start up a conversation, and he quite literally stares at the TV and won't respond. When I tell him I would like a response and I'm wondering if he heard me, he says he ""has nothing to say"". I don't interrogate him, I just talk about different topics I have in mind!

And then he says we'll go out for a walk together, go to the beach etc and when the day comes to do these things, he ends up telling me he doesn't want to. 

I have depression, panic attacks and my dad passed away end of last year so I'm not in a position where I feel overly confident about myself. If he looks at the TV whilst I'm talking to him, I take it to heart. When he spends more time making plans with his friends than he does with me, it really hurts me. 

He knows all of this, and that I've put him on a pedestal because he's all I have right now. I've put college, Uni and my passion for travelling on permanent hold because those things weren't going in the same direction as he was, and he knows this.

Is he taking advantage of the fact he knows he can get away with an easy life because I'll never leave? To me, he's a genuinely sensitive and loving person, but I think he favours doing things the easy way and making life as comfortable for himself as possible. How do I resolve all of this?

TL;DR:","  My partner is not interested in anything I want to do, and it's putting a strain on our relationship. He knows I'm depressed and anxious, but he doesn't seem to care.

That's one thing; I also have a girlfriend of 2+ years and we have yet to kiss, I haven't gotten even my learner's license yet, and throughout my life I have refused to use any drugs/alcohol to this point.

Now, I've been really satisfied with all this untill today, when an old friend and I got together and met up with our third friend (who turns out to now smoke weed/is now on a two month light-every-day streak). This lead to a messed up day of following them to dealers and near fights, small town gangs and free kijiji kittens, all leading to getting some friends together to light up.

I did nothing but follow and listen to them today, and what an average day for any one of them amazed me. I left and thought about my current life, and now I'm here on askreddit while laying in bed.

Basically, I want to know how normal I am.

TL;DR:","  17 year old going into grade 12, have yet to get my learner's license, have refused drugs/alcohol to this point, met up with old friend who smokes weed and it lead to a fucked up day.","  I don't do anything in my life, and I spent a day following friends function through their weed related day to day activities. This 'normal' teenager life contradicts mine a lot. Am I still a normal person?"

TITLE: I (20F) think I want to break up with live in boyfriend (20M) of two years.. not sure how to do it

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, and living together since we were together around 6 months. 
Everything was awesome, we rarely fought and there has rarely been any huge issues aside from a few times I've come across him text messaging other women inappropriate things, which he apologized for and I forgave him, etc. (I'm surprised i did, i have serious trust issues)

Now, lately, I've been feeling very upset and frustrated, and generally unhappy.

I feel as though I need to be on my own, I want to travel and explore and do all kinds of things that he's not interested in. I find myself thinking things like ""if I was single I'd go do this"" or ""if I became single again I'd go here or try this"" & I'm realising that if I ever want to do those things, it likely won't be while I'm with him.

But, here's the hard part - I have no idea if he feels the same way - he knows something is wrong because I've completely shut down over the weekend, my mind is so jumbled and I'm so confused that I didn't eat anything yesterday so I'm obviously not feeling well. Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.

Don't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore. I feel held back, trapped! I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..

So what I need is advice - How do I do it? We live together so this will be incredibly hard... I'm so scared to break his heart, I'm scared he'll get angry. I'm terrible at confrontation, so i'll likely break down and be bawling before I even get any words out...

Please help :(

TL;DR:","  Been with boyfriend for over 2 years, everything was great but recently I've been feeling unhappy and confused, think I want to break up with him, don't know how to do it without hurting him too much",  want to break up with live in boyfriend of over two years.. no idea how to do it or how the conversation should go..

TITLE: My girlfriend [21F] has been incredibly controlling lately, what should I [19F] do?

POST: I have been with my girlfriend for 1 year and a half, and I love her dearly. I truly believe she is my soulmate and that I will spend the rest of my life with her. However, she has been incredibly controlling lately and I don't know what to do about it. 

She goes to college about 2- 2 1/2 hours away from where I go to college, so I see her when she comes home on weekends. When she's up at school, she has to know where I am, and if I'm not in my room doing homework, she's mad that I'm not talking to her. If I'm with my friends at all she gets very angry because I could instead be talking to her. And by talking to her, she means like Skype. I text and snapchat her pretty regularly when with friends. She will claim I am making her depressed and anxious, and will be very distant toward me if I don't talk to her the night prior. The most ridiculous thing she's done in regards to control is telling me she drank and drove the night before because I wasn't talking to her so she wanted to spite me. 

I told her if she doesn't stop I will break up with her. She told me she couldn't and within 5 minutes she called me and begged for me to come back to her house because she would do everything in her power to fix it. 

According to her, this controlling thing is because she has severe anxiety. She is so insecure and anxious, so craves my attention to reassure her. Though this may sound like bullshit, she legitimately does have really bad anxiety and gets panic attacks very frequently.  She claims once she comes home from school (she graduates in a month) that she won't feel this way anymore because then we will be in the same city. 

I love her to death and don't want to break up, but this situation is stressing me quite a lot. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

I rushed to the library and emailed my teacher as soon as possible explaining the situation... but so far she hasn't responded. And it's Sunday.

TITLE: I (f20) think I'm in an emotional relationship with my friend (m20). I don't know how I should handle this.

POST: I have a really close friend who is a guy. We've been friends for 2 years and we're neighbors who spend most of our weeknights together. He is honestly one of the greatest people I know-- I trust him with my life. We're moving in together (platonic) in a few weeks in a new city and we're both extremely excited, but I'm nervous about our relationship.

People tease us already that we're dating and his mom is convinced that we're together. We usually just deny it and laugh it off, but I feel like there's some subtext that we're not addressing. We'll playfully tease each other or he'll tickle me randomly when we're hanging out; we're pretty touchy/cuddly with each other but nothing over the top or scandalous. We talk about everything and I feel it's safe to say we're best friends. 

There have been moments where I've wanted to kiss him and be relationship cuddly, but there's always been something holding me back. Like, I can't picture having sex with him at all (not that he's unattractive, I just literally can't see it). I want/can picture kissing him, but the second I try and imagine something more sexual, I can't.  

Futhermore, I can't say I'm too thrilled about him getting a girlfriend either. It's not like I'd ever sabotage anything for him, but I'm not too keen on the idea of sharing him or spending less time with him. I know that mindset is unhealthy, so I'm trying my best to keep it under wraps. 

I'm afraid I'm in an emotional relationship with him and I'm concerned about what might happen when we move in together. Any advice or opinion would be greatly appreciated.

POST: My ex and I were in a relationship for one year. We now discovered many differences between us and decided to stop our relationship (in a rather negative way, i.e. big fight). She said that she got nothing from this relationship and wondered why she got involved with me in the first place.

One week later, she posted on fb that she is looking for a new relationship. And I feel very sad about that. Although our relationship was troublesome toward the end, it has its moments that I still cherish. I did care about her and wanted to be with her while I was in a relationship with her. But it seemed like she did not feel the same way. Her wanting a new relationship so quickly hurts my feelings because our relationship appeared not to be that meaningful to her.

* Was what she has done right? or was she being inconsiderate/insensitive?
* Am I supposed to be feeling like this? Am I too needy/clingy?
* How should I cope with this?
* I'm still ""friends"" with her on fb, should I just remove her? I little part in me still wants to go back to her so I don't really want to cut all connections to her.

TITLE: Tried to teach my dog to play dead. Instead gave him a complex.

POST: A few months back, I was reading up on how to teach your dog to play dead.  The whole guiding him onto his back with a treat, then reinforcing with praise and reward.  I figured I'd give it a shot.

So I get home from work and get down to business.  Ozzy's catching on pretty quickly.  Within 10 minutes, I have him rolling onto his back on command.  I was pointing my finger at him and saying, ""BANG!"" as a cue.  Suddenly though, as he's lying on his back, he pees a little.  (In my excitement to teach him a new trick, I forgot to let him out to pee!)  He's obviously ashamed of himself, even though I didn't get mad at him as it was my fault.

After we've cleaned up and gone out for a pee break, I attempt the trick again.  Point my finger at him and say ""BANG"".  Ozzy tucks his ears back and slinks underneath my computer desk.  No amount of calling, bribing, or coaxing gets him out until I leave the room.  Since then, he gets stressed when you make a finger gun at him, or if you say the word bang.  He will often try to slink under the computer desk or go into his kennel.

So my theories on what might be going on:

* He somehow associated the memory of wetting himself to the cues I gave him
* He's afraid of fireworks and thunderstorms and the loud ""BANG"" is too harsh of a cue word
* The word ""BANG"" sounds too close to the word ""Bad"" and he thinks that when I point at him and say it, that he's being punished for something.

In any case, it's been months and I can't even bait him to lie on his back anymore.  Get him to lie down and try to move a treat across his shoulder?  He just goes ""NOPE"" and gets up and looks for his safety desk.

POST: Hey all, 

I wanted to get some advice on how to reach out to biological family members that I've never met. Basically, my mom got pregnant with me with her boyfriend of three years and he told her he doesn't like kids and didn't want to be involved with raising me, which I don't have any hard feelings about. My mom remarried and my step dad adopted me, so I had a father figure who treated me like his own.

I have never reached out because I didn't think I was ready but recently have been thinking about contacting them. I know about a half sister I have from my bio dad's first marriage and she's in her thirties and lives really close by. My bio dad lives across the country. Would it be weird reaching out to her over Facebook? Or should I contact my biological dad first? I don't know if she knows about me so I don't want to shock her with the info or create a riff in the family. I'm really just a stranger to them.

Another reason I am upset is that last week we went out with some friends and he told everyone that he was leaving in the summer for a month to do an internship across the country. I had to leave and started crying when I got home. I was upset because he didn't even think about telling me this privately first and also because he's leaving before me and doesn't seem to mind. He is still adamant that he will love me no matter how far apart we are... but I'm not quite as secure. Of course, I want to be supportive, but I think it will take time.

TITLE: Relationship of conflicting faiths.

POST: So I've been in a relationship with this girl (Me m/18 her f/17) for about 2 months. Prior to that we dated for a little over 3 months nearly exactly a year ago. The first relationship ended abruptly when her father banned us from seeing each other because I'm an atheist and her father is a pastor and her faith mean an awful lot to her. 

This time her father has been a whole lot less protective of her by allowing us to be together. Unfortunately he still doesn't trust me at all. We aren't allowed to be together alone. My mother or some member of her family have to be with us at almost all times. If we go out in public her twin sister comes with us almost always. He has told me before that this has everything to do with my faith. In the beginning I totally understood his distrust but I thought it would get better over time. Prior to the relation ship we were friends for about 2 years and I had many conversations with her father on various topics.

This alone would be fine but she also pushes me very hard to change various mannerisms that I have. When she's around I can't really be myself at all. I find myself censoring myself very very often because she would get mad at me. Whenever I listen to my music around her she starts to get uncomfortable whenever the music has profanities or any themes really more than ""G rated""(I listen to lots of punk rock if that gives you a better image).

I approached him. We were fuck buddies during summer before I went to college. No feelings. Usually sex is always better in my head, but this was different, it was damn good. He wasn't married then.

I went to college. He got married. He said that we can continue our 'relationship' but during summer I travelled and worked abroad. Repeated that for 4 years. Minding my own business. We lost touch.

In June we met in our neighbourhood and he offered me a job. I was planning to go abroad again and he said that I can start when I want. This is my last year at uni, classes are easy and aren't mandatory. So I thought great, it is good job, good money and, most important, it will help me gain experience.

I work there 6 weeks. I want him to fuck me. Now I sit in office, with two other co-workers, he is in his office few meters away and I imagining how he fucks me. No comment.

He flirts a little when we are alone, nothing inappropriate, we have lunch sometimes... He said that if I want, I just have to send him text and that was it. Didn't mention it again.

I planned to work here until I finish uni and then I will move abroad for good. I have some dates, 'good' old Tinder, but nothing interesting.

We both have our issues and that is putting extra stress on the relationship, but my boyfriend's constant negativity and lack of motivation has become a massive problem. My boyfriend was born with greater than 50% hearing loss in both ears and cannot hear many things without the assistance of hearing aids. He wasn't able to hear well at all until his teenage years and he received better hearing aids that helped him hear many things he could not hear before. While he has graduated from college and held jobs, he still views himself as a victim, even though he can hear well at this point in his life.

He is seriously the most self loathing person I've ever met. I have tried to encourage him but I'm losing patience. In the beginning I didn't care that my boyfriend was hearing impaired since there wasn't a communication problem at all, he can hear well with hearing aids, and he seemed to be a pretty confident and social person despite his hearing impairment. Now, I am starting to think that he was faking it for the first few months, and he's really just content to be an angry and negative human being. He gets mad every time he thinks someone is looking at his hearing aids, or asks well-meaning questions about his hearing loss.

ended things between us by the middle of June; I couldn't handle it.

We ended up together again this past December, still a LD situation. We made some great progress in communication and thinking of the other person in our choices and stuff. It was a very different relationship this time around, much better.

Then he told me in late March he would be not be attending the university I am currently enrolled in (like I was anxiously anticipating), but another in our hometown because it was a better situation for him. 

Fast forward to now. He was officially accepted two days ago. He says he doesn't know how to act or what to say around me anymore because things have just begun to crumble. 

Why would I want to stay with someone I know I won't be with in the fall? Why not let us both be free from the frustration?
We love each other still. I'm glad he's going to this other university; it will be a more successful environment for him. But it hurts. I have no friends where I live. My good friends all live a couple hours away, and I don't have the time or money to devote to going out to see them, as much as I'd like to.

Would it be worth it to try to stay with him? Or cut things off now?

TL;DR:",  My LD boyfriend and I are incompatible. He's going to another university and I'm not. I love him but the relationship is becoming stale. Should I stay with him or end things now?,  Socially incompatible relationship ending in August due to unforeseen-ish circumstances. SO is only pleasant friend figure in town. Should I stay or should I break it off?

TITLE: TIFU by forgetting which CD I was listening to when my head unit died

POST: This wasn't today, this was in the summer of '95.

I was making decent money living at home and lifeguarding during the summer.  Had a car that I had saved up to install a sound system.  I got Infinity speakers, Alpine V12 amp, and a [Sony CDX-C910] head unit.  This head unit was the most expensive, therefore best (teenager, remember) thing I could buy.  It had to be professionally installed by an authorized Sony installer to not void the warranty (or some such bs).

Anyway, it is an amazing CD player, hooked up to a nice amp, powering decent speakers in a bad environment for music; I loved every bit of it.

Now for those who can't imagine it now, we used to have to go to the store to buy CDs.  I lived in a smaller town, but we had a store within about ~10 miles that i bought some of my rarer imports from.  Stuff you wouldn't find in the mall.

One day my head unit died, no display, no power.  I didn't think to try and manually remove whatever CD was in there.  I scheduled an appointment with the installer of the head unit and a few days later, took it in.  I didn't have a ride, but it was my day off, so I grabbed some CDs out of the car and went into their sound room and chilled out for a few hours reading magazines.  Yes, I said hours(!).  About 3 hours later the installer comes out and finds me.  He explained that they thought it was something simple like a blown fuse.  They found a blown fuse and replaced it, but the sound was horrible.  They troubleshot the whole unit before replacing it.  Twice.  They couldn't figure out what was going on until they swapped out the CD.  That's when he held up the CD I was listening to at the time it died, [Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God (halo nine UK import)] disc 2, and I it all hit me.

For those that have never heard it - here's the first song on that CD ([Nine Inch Nails - Closer to God](

TL;DR:","  Head unit of a CD player died, they swapped out the CD I was listening to at the time it died, and I discovered the first song on that CD.","  They could have saved themselves some times by using a reference CD of their own, but if only I had remembered what CD I was listening to, I might have saved 3 hours of my life getting a blown fuse swapped out."

TITLE: [NSV][PIC] Frustration, determination and the perfect pair of pants.

POST: So, I started running.  

More specifically, I started the C25k program in hopes of becoming a *runner*.  Sometimes, it still feels like I might not make it through those last intervals of week 3.   However, after week 1, I learned how tolerable running could be if I just never looked at the timer.   *(""I still have THAT much time left?  Fff."")*  Instead, I would zone out, not look at the clock and think about awesome, motivating things.

Since starting on this road, every Monday I would muster up the courage to step up to the scale and be faced with my destiny, my frustration, watching the numbers move in tiny increments or sometimes, not at all.  The numbers shouldn't have mattered so much to me, but they did.  I would get discouraged and lose focus on the fitness goals I was truly trying to achieve.   

I stopped looking at the scale, too. 

If I'd had to guess at what the scale would've said then, it wouldn't have been much different from 2 months ago...  and then my capris humbled me.  

So, I bought these awesome capris a while ago that had sadly been stretching out in the wash over time.  I loved these capris.  (When you find bottoms you like, you never let them go.)   Hoping to find another pair, I go back to the store and there they are...  one last pair tucked away in a sale rack, but the tag reads 2 sizes too small.   Perfect for ""goal"" clothing! 

In the modesty of my bedroom, I try on these capris to see how far I have to go to get into these babies.  I don't know which emotion was stronger, dismay or delight, when they fit slightly loosely around my giddy little self.    My happy dance quickly turned into: *""Ergh... now I have to find something else that fits me this well...""*  Which subsequently turned back into a happy dance after I realized how much easier it's going to be to find clothes that FIT now...

TL;DR:","  Started running, learned how frustrating it can be to keep track of numbers, bought awesome capris that are slightly too small, now have to find something else that fits me this well...","  Stopped relying on the scale to determine my feeling of progress, kept up with my regimen, and now the perfect pants are too big.  Sometimes, ignorance really is bliss. "

TITLE: I [23M] have had a crush on [21F] for 2 months without having met or seen her at all. Can it count?

POST: As title says, I've only been in contact through text (I don't know how she looks). I've known her for around 2 years, but a lot of time has passed within those 2 years without us talking. We recently began communicating more often, and related to that, I fell in love. I've been in love before, but only with girls who I've seen and talked to the ""normal way"". I mean love as in ""I'm prepared to spend my meager student savings to fly across half of the world just to meet her for a day and hold her hand for a second"" love.

If you asked me what I love/dislike about her, I would be able to list things that I don't love, but they seem irrelevant to me at this moment, and most importantly I dont want to turn this into a study of her, since I would unavoidably skew it to get the answer I want.

She knows how I feel but highly doubts that I love the ""real"" her in any relevant way. I have my reasons to believe that personal reasons she previously revealed to me before I confessed shapes her opinion in the matter (which is why I'm here for a second opinion). Reasons that are private and really not relevant as long as you accept the premise. Her feelings are ultimately equally irrelevant for this specific question.

My question is: Am I LIKELY loving someone that only exists in my head? In a way I guess we all love/hate people based on personal perceptions, but you get what I mean. I know she isn't a reflection of me, it's her differences that excite me the most (I think). 

I know 2 months is a drop in the ocean, and I could just wait and see if my feelings disappear as quickly as they came (previous experiences hint towards years of feeling like this before it fades).

TL;DR:",  I've had a crush on a girl for 2 months without ever meeting or seeing her. She knows how I feel but doubts that I love her in any relevant way. Can it count?,  Fell in love with someone I've only communicated with through text. Should I listen to my feelings or should I get over someone who doesn't exist?

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my group of best friends since childhood [26 M]. Our interactions have grown boring, stagnant, and apathetic. I want change, but I don't want to leave them behind.

POST: Recently, I was taking stock of what I did this summer, and the answer was...not a whole lot.

I have a group of about eight guys I grew up with and consider lifelong friends. People that have met us have said what we have is really rare, some Stand By Me shit. I love them. I was the best man in one of their weddings.

Some have moved and got married, and one in particular is going through some difficult financial times. In those cases, I can understand why I don't see and do things with them as much. It's a natural part of getting older.

Still, though, there's a group of 4-5 guys I see every single weekend. But the problem is we can never decide on doing anything. One person doesn't like clubs. Another doesn't want to spend cash in a bar. Another hates beaches. There's always fighting about what to do. There's always dissent. And it always ends in the lowest common denominator---sitting in one of our apartments drinking and watching TV.

And I've reached a breaking point. I'm single, and I really don't have any social circle outside of them. I went to college on the other side of the country, and while I have friends there that I keep in touch with, I see them once a year.

I honestly don't know what to do? I don't even know how to make friends at this point. And I don't want to abandon my friends that I love. Up until a few years ago, things were fun! But for a 26 year-old, single guy living in the city, my life has become so boring and routine that I want to scream.

Help!

TL;DR:",  My group of best friends since childhood has become stale and apathetic. I love them but the constant fighting and arguing is driving me insane. I want to change but don't want to leave them behind.,  My best friends growing up are boring and would rather sit and drink all day then do anything new or exciting. And I'm at my breaking point.

TITLE: Many of my [25M] friends [~25Fs] want to cheat with me. What is going on?

POST: First, a little background information about me:

I was never that popular in primary and high school, not a loser mind you, but never super popular.

My parents are pretty religious (I'm not at all) and strict, and I went to all-boys schools. Because of this, the friends that I had were mostly guy friends, and most girls I knew I thought of as acquaintances.

After moving to the big city to attend university I made a decision to not be the weird loner in class, and began the 'fake it til you make it' thing - and I really did make it. I got myself a bunch of really nice close friends and we do lots of stuff together all the time. First time really having female friends.

Now here comes my problem:

Most of my girl friends are in, what I would call, pretty serious comitted relationships, and weirdly enough they want to cheat on their boyfriends with me!

And I'm not misunderstanding any weird signals, they are very direct:

* ""My boyfriend isn't home for the weekend, do you want to come home with me tonight and have some dirty fun?""
* ""I only asked you to come outside with me to make out with you, if you'd like.""
* Etc.

I always turn them down - I never liked the idea of cheating and they know this. One of them even told me the next day that she respected me more now.

I find it really weird that it isn't just one fluke, but many of my friends that try this. And mind you, not the female friends that are single, only the ones in relationships.

What I'm wondering is, why do they do this? Is it some kind of weird test of my ethics?

This isn't normal is it? Am I sending some 'cheaty'-vibes?
Do I just treat it as a compliment?

TL;DR:",  many of my female friends want to cheat on their boyfriends with me. It's weird and I always turn them down. Why do they do this? Is it some kind of weird test of my ethics?,  Many of my girl friends (whom are in relationships) want to cheat with me (single). Why? I'm confused.

TITLE: My GF [18F] and I [17M] plan on breaking up before college. Don't know what to feel anymore.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year and will soon be starting our last semester of school together. Sometime earlier this year, we agreed the best plan of action going into college would be for us to break up, not because we were unsatisfied with the relationship but because we both accepted we needed to develop individually, we could end up geographically really far apart and other things like that. Odds tend to stack against relationships from high school going into college. 

I don't know how I feel about this anymore. It doesn't feel good though. 

I love her. I fall in love with her again and again every day and the closer we get to this agreement, the more I love her. It seems stupid to love her with the expiration date attached to the relationship, but it feels real and I can't stop. 

We've tried to talk about this quite a few times but the conversation doesn't tend to go much of anywhere because I don't know how I feel anymore. It hurts to talk about it, too. I know what its like to have to leave people close to me and it hurts knowing that know they're just images on my computer or words on my phone or photos on my desk. I don't know if I'm ready to make her a memory.

When we first talked about this we were both so certain that, despite the fact we loved each other, a breakup before college would be best. But now I'm wondering if want I really want is to try to make it work past graduation. I need help sorting out my own feelings about the relationship and thoughts about the reality of the situation.

TITLE: TIFU by looking like an asshole at the GreatClips

POST: Today I got a haircut. 

I was going to give the Asian lady who cut my hair a tip so I asked her to charge $4 extra on my card like I normally do at this place. Little did I know, they had changed their system to what most consider a normal tipping method where you write your tip on the receipt. 

After filling out the receipt and handing it back to her, I asked (referring to the new style of tipping), ""How is that for you?"" At first she didn't seem to understand so I repeated it louder, ""How is that for you?"" She looked at the receipt, quickly nodded and said equally loud that the tip was much ""good, good!""

I was given weird stares on the way out by the other eight or so people there. I didn't realize my mistake until I closed the door. The worst part is that she gave a really good haircut and probably deserved more of a tip but I am poor.

TL;DR:","  Asked an Asian lady at the GreatClips how her tip was, she misunderstood and gave a really good haircut but probably deserved less of a tip.","  While trying to make small talk, I inadvertently asked a foreign hairstylist if my tip was good enough for her while others listened."

TITLE: x-post from AskReddit: Girlfriend of three years made out with two people over the weekend. . . What to do?

POST: I was told to post this here for more advice. 

[Original thread](

The title says most of it. . . We were partying with some friends, and about halfway through the night, one of my buddies asked me if she and I were still together. We'd been having some rough times over the last few months, so I figured they were just asking how that had turned out. I said yes, and so did she. Over the course of the evening, a few more people came and asked me the same thing.

At the end of the night, one of my good friends came to me a little sheepishly, and told me my girlfriend had gone up to him and just made out with him with no warning. A couple others told me she was ""all over them,"" and I walked in on her making out with another kid that I didn't know so well.

When I confronted her the next day, I asked what was going on. She said she ""didn't know what came over her"" and that she was sorry. But I don't buy it. You don't just do that stuff if there isn't something under the surface, right?

I could really use some advice on what to do, how to deal with what's gone on, and where to go from here. She always told me that she'd dump me on the spot if she found out I was fooling around with other people, and that she thought it was completely unacceptable and there was no excuse; so I never thought I'd be dealing with this with her. I'm pretty pissed off, and a little hurt; hypocrisy has always driven me up the wall, so I'm really not sure what to do.

Thanks in advance, Reddit!

TITLE: My boyfriend (M17) constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and really messes up my (F17) self esteem.

POST: We've been dating for fourteen months. My boyfriend has always been very honest with me about everything, which is one of the things I first loved about him. If I asked him a question, he'd give an honest answer, no matter what. My problem with this started about six months ago, when he told me that he liked another girl for the first month of our relationship, and the only reason they aren't dating is because she turned him down twice. It broke my heart. But he's started being honest about things that I really don't want to know the answer to, or question I haven't asked, such as telling me how hot another girl is, or how she has an awesome chest or ass, or along the same lines. Like, I get it. They're all very attractive. He'll always send me links from porn that he finds really attractive.

But the problem lies in the fact that I have absolutely terrible self image, and with good reason. I have little to no curves, and a bit of extra chub on my stomach. I'm not fat by any means, but definitely not skinny. And every single girl he likes, or thinks is attractive, has a massive chest with a huge butt and is perfectly skinny. Think Victoria Secret model. And if they aren't curvy, they're short and cute and skinny and blonde, which is the exact opposite from me.

The real kicker came yesterday, when he decided it would be a good idea to tell me he's in love with a fictional character. I freaked out, probably a bit more than I should, but I'm just so tired of it. Once we started fighting over this, he started trying to eat his words, saying that he just meant that she's ""fun to play with"". He had been talking about how she's so cute and perfect and attractive with awesome cleavage for ten minutes before, which is just suppose to traslate into ""fun to play with"". I don't know what to do. I love him so much, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm a second choice behind all these other girls. What can I do? I'm can't feel so worthless for much longer.

POST: Let's call my ex- boyfriend James. OK first off, I don't really know if he's really my ex, since we are pretty much in contact and he keeps saying he will come back to me when he's done growing up. 

So recently, James's father has not been well, and needed to get surgery. Living in Canada, health care is pretty much free, so hospital bills are not the problem. However, because of this illness, he will be unable to continue working for the next 3 years. James has just finished his bachelor in electrical engineering, but has no internships or related working experience. His mother who is also working, says she can't afford working alone to support their family of 5 and is pressuring him to find a job. I don't know what she exactly said to him because I wasn't there, but James last week, cried to me over the phone, saying he needs to find a job and grow up, and to do that, he wanted a break.

James, for the years I have been with him, has sort of slacked off, and would sort of treat me like shit occasionally, for which I would reprimand him. But I've always felt the need to help him however I can. It's partially my fault, that he has become the way he is, because I was the one pushing him to apply to jobs (I would make his resume and cover letters as well as apply for the jobs for him). He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them. Because of my success with finding jobs and his failure, he sometimes tells me ""you're only getting hired because you're a girl"". 

Anyway, he's been feeling really low on himself, but he doesn't really have anyone to support him except me, but he just wanted to be friends until he can figure things out. 

I wanted to distance myself from him so he could get the peace he wanted, but he calls me and wants my company, so I don't understand... Why he wanted a beak.

Should I keep supporting him, or do I leave him be?

TL;DR:","  Ex-boyfriend is depressed because his father is ill and can't work, and wants a break.

POST: So like many other TIFUs this happened awhile ago. I beleive it was my freshman year of high school when it happened.

I live near my high school so I always walk to and from my house to school. It's about a 10-15 minute walk, and there happens to be a small old persons and adult only hospital on my street. 

One day after school, I was walking home as usual. I had my earphones on and was blasting my music full volume cause I like listening to music as I walk home.

I was just crossing the street on green when I finally noticed that I was the only one crossing and even the cars had stopped. Okay? I though.

Suddenly I look to my right just in time to see the ambulance coming from my street break just before it hit me. It was literally a few inches away from me. I froze for a second, but then broke out of my daze and hurried by.

I still feel so incredibly bad for that, and since then I've never had my music as loud. And I've never walked with both earphones is either..

POST: I finally got a job! I've never been so happy to piss in a cup before in my life. I am convinced that even though online job sites have openings in seemingly entry level jobs, that they really aren't hiring. After checking sites like craigslist (only restaurants, everything else  on there is pretty much a scam) and Indeed.com and applying to every position that I qualified for the only place that ever called me in for an interview was McDonald's... and they didn't even hire me! I even tried through a temp agency for a while to no avail. What really pissed me off about the temp service is that the only job they ever wanted to offer me was an over-night housekeeping position at a hospital. I have experience as a housekeeper but I was being upfront and honest when I said that housekeeping isn't something I was interested in doing anymore. I suppose beggars can not be choosy though. Just as I was seriously considering this job, I saw in the newspaper (hey, I was looking in every resource I could get my hands on for a job!) that they had not only one but two ads for jobs that I would much rather do than house keep! One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications! I said, why do they need more applications when they can not even find jobs for the people that have already signed up!

And I really want to say thanks to reddit because I did take a lot of advice here to heart. I wish I could link to the posts and give due credit. One post was something along the lines of: (Dealing with confidence issues) ""Just fake it until you make it."" Another post was a very informative post on askreddit about tips for when you actually do get interviews that said that s/he added at the end of the interview, when asked if s/he had any questions said: ""What can I do or say today that will give me this job tomorrow?""

POST: Basically my SO and I have been together for roughly 2 years. Our relationship is fantastic, very open and honest. But, around a week ago we were sat talking on the sofa and he took his phone out to show me a photo of his cat. While he was scrolling i noticed a photo of a scantily dressed unidentified female in his camera roll. He clicked on it and was like ""wtf?"" and I was just speechless. Couldn't say anything, didn't know what to say or do. 

Instantly he said that he didn't know how that got there and was really confused. He genuinely looked really upset and confused by the situation. I said maybe he accidentally saved it from some website or w/e. He said that he didn't know and couldn't remember watching or looking at porn of said image. I pretty much shut down and just couldn't say anything else for a while. Eventually he tried to talk to me and apologised for me feeling so shitty and said that it was understandable I was upset. I was very upset, but managed to hold my shit together. We had a talk about it and I pretty much said that I knew he wouldn't do anything like that to me etc.. 

And to be honest I really can't see him cheating on me and having a picture of her on his phone or anything like that. And it wouldn't bother me if it was just an image from porn. But I can't help but feel upset and uneasy about it. I have a lot of doubt in my head, and I don't know if it's unfounded. He's never given me a reason to doubt him before. And I know I probably shouldn't now. 

Am I crazy to feel hurt?

TL;DR:",  SO of 2 years accidentally showed me a photo of a barely clothed female on his phone. I feel really uncomfortable about it and have a lot of doubt in my head. Am I crazy for feeling upset?,  SO and I stumbled across a risque picture of another female on his phone. He says he doesn't know how it got there but I'm just not sure.

TITLE: I have to take an online class (no other options). The professor wants to do an online meeting. I'm a commuter student, and my internet speed is worse than most of the US.

POST: I failed a math last semester, but just found out- today- that I have to take it immediately again. Summer classes start tomorrow.

I already have summer classes to take, and am going to be doing the online math class before/after those. 

The problem is an email I got:

> I would like to have an on-line meeting on Tuesday, June 14 at 8:30 p.m. using my virtual office

My other summer classes don't last that long. I'd rather not spend another 9 hours on campus after that... I live off-campus, 30min commute on a good day. 

The biggest thing is that my internet speeds are ass. Just, pure ass. It takes an hour to load a 20min youtube vid at 144p. [Speedtest.net says my internet is worse than 98% of the US.] It's a data softcap. I get 10G of the regular speeds (1mbps) a month. Once that 10 gigs of data is used, it's back to ass speeds.

However, I do get unlimited internet from 12am-5am (which sometimes starts at 10:30? or 11? sometimes 3am???).

The local library closes at 8pm.

I don't know what to do, or what to tell the professor.

TL;DR:","  I have to take an online math class. My internet speed is ass. I live off-campus, 30min commute. I'm a commuter student.

TITLE: TIFU by buying a safety razor.

POST: I'm the type of man that uses an electric shaver to shave and never have used a safety razor, but yesterday I saw Pawn Star Rick Harrison's single bladed safety razor at the checkout station in Walmart. It looked like a man's man razor and being the alpha male I am I bought it. I brought the safety razor to my jaw and swiped to the right it was the closest shave I've ever had in my life.

 After that I started shaving other parts of my sexy body and eventually it got the point where I shaved my beard,chest, arms,legs,ass,pubes, and yes even my balls after feeling like a new man I then hopped into the shower and admired my self in my mirror for ten minutes and then crashed.

 I woke up this morning and immediately I realized I fucked up it feels like I have sunburn and tiny paper cuts all over my skin and it fucking burns! My only guess as to what caused this complete fuckup was I didn't apply shaving cream when I was shaving or after shave is this what razor burn feels like?!

TITLE: Reddit: I want to lose weight....but am lacking the motivation to just do it...any suggestions?

POST: I've always had a slight issue with my weight. My lowest weight was when I was 16 at 109lbs and more recently when I was 24 I weighed about 122lbs, now Im closer to 180 (and I'm 27 now). I blame this on my sheer laziness and grad school life as well as my inability to say no to candy and yummy tasting food. This **needs** to stop though because I *feel* unhealthy. 

I used to be a gymnast when I was younger, and was super flexible...with this in mind, I decided to go to a yoga class 2 weeks ago and was absolutely wrecked after it to the point where I couldnt do anything physical for a week. I have lost all my flexibility and I'm totally out of shape :( 

I want to try a weight loss/exercise program that will work and keep me motivated. I was thinking about combining Weight Watchers with P90X...but honestly I don't even think I could do half the moves in the work out video.

TITLE: How do you deal with a dying friend?

POST: I made a friend back in the forth grade with duchenne muscular dystrophy more than a decade ago. Since then we have been best friends. I knew early on that he was not long for this world but there was never a given time line. I've watched him from being able to lift his hands above his head to not being able to move them at all. He's always been a good conversationalist as his mouth hasn't weakened due to his condition. Now 25 years old he struggles to sit up for more than an hour at a time. I just spoke with his mother and its beginning to sound like my friend won't make it to the end of the year.

I always pictured him dying of a quick complication or something sudden. I pains me to see him reach this state of being, not being able to do anything he loves but mentally all there to feel the pain and frustration. He has lived a pretty good life given the hand he was dealt, it just doesn't seem right for it to end in frustration.

My friend is a trooper though. He will sit through his pain in a room of his friends than to lie alone in his room sleeping it off. He had me set up his computer in his room so that his other friends would still have something to hang around on even though his confined to his bed for most of the day.

My friend and I are really close but his death has never been a subject we've discussed and I never hope to. I think we both enjoy discussing video games and televisions show more than wasting time talking about unchangeable facts.

TITLE: TIFU by bathing in my cats' feces.

POST: Actually happened today!

So I had surgery last week to repair a torn labrum in my shoulder. I've been mostly lounging around and was starting to feel anxious, so I decided to start cleaning up a bit.

Eventually I come up with the brilliant idea to clean my basement, where my demon feline children house their litterbox. I decided that, because I was futilely attempting to clean in the first place, I may as well wash out the litterbox beforehand.

Enter fuck up.

Now an intelligent person would have seen the limits of their powers after barely half dragging the litter box to the dumpster 

and asking a small old lady to help me dump it.

Not me though. I got this shit.

After bringing casa de feces back to the basement I realize it's still caked in its fair share if shit, piss, and other goodies. I realize that the only way to remedy this problem is by filling it to the absolute fucking top with water and scrubbing the sides with an old rag.
Keep in mind that this is in and old sink probably about chest level.

After I had scoured the box clean and was satisfied with my concentration of piss/shit water, I then realized I only had one arm to dump every thing down the drain. No problem of course, 
shouldn't be any hassle whatsoever.

I was wrong.

After carefully starting to tip Shitanic to the side I immediately lost all semblance of control or a plan. As the entire container went over in one fell swoop I quickly realized the the shallow sink was not going to hold this cascading waterfall of terror.
Before I could even think about moving, but coincidentally just slowly enough I could open my mouth, I'm hit full on in the face with an Old Faithful of my cats' Seafood sensations lunch of yore.
Ever inch of me from head to tow covered in nasty ass piss and shit water. I even got the opportunity to taste some Friskies after extended marination.

I can feel poop in my eye

TL;DR:","  Was cleaning my basement, decided to bathe in my cats' shit. Ended up with a massive waterfall of piss and shit water all over me.","  I dump the water I used to clean my cats litterbox in a sink, ended trying out a new bodywash."

TITLE: [21/m] My girlfriend (21/f) asked for us to be good friends, with the possibility of getting back together.

POST: My girlfriend (or ex now) asked for us to take some time apart. But by time apart, she means time out of relationship. 

We met about 2 months ago and dated for around a month. This was the first relationship for both of us in several years and we were both very excited to start. However, she began feeling too much pressure. She needed time to think if she truly likes/loves me or not and she wasn't able to have that time. 

The strange thing is she wants us to be close friends. She believes that a relationship can only be strongest if two people are very good friends already before establishing the relationship. So she wants to become good friends with me first. We moved along very quickly but she still barely knows who I am and vice versa. Two months isn't exactly enough to get to know someone so deeply. She still wants to spend a lot of time with me. But she doesn't want the burden of a relationship just yet. She said that she doesn't want to be forced to like me just because we're in a relationship. She wants her boyfriend to be her best friend as well.

But the thing is, she said she wants us to be good friends before we get together again. I also made sure to point out that I'm trying to get back together with her, and she accepted that as well. We only met each other recently but we've grown extremely fond of each other. Just too much stress I guess. 

I want to know what to do. I want to know how long I wait before I try again. She didn't give me a time. These things can't be measured in a specific time frame. I really like this girl and she's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. How do I know if we can still work out?

TITLE: My parents constantly check in on me (21F) when I'm on a date with my boyfriend (20M)

POST: I'm an only child with very over protective parents. I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months now and I recently started going to his house to hang out.

The first time I went there, I had a lot of fun watching movies until late with him and his parents. Late as in 2am. I forgot to check my phone till on the way back at 2:30 with 6 missed calls, 4 voicemails, and multiple texts if I was ok. I find that quite excessive. He's not my first boyfriend, nor my first serious boyfriend. I told them where I was going, so it wasn't like they should he surprised as he stays at my house till 1-2am. 

Yesterday, I went deep sea fishing with my boyfriend and family. I told my parents where and what boat I was going on to try and help out, plus the times we'd be out to sea. I texted them after I got off of the boat and posted pictures on facebook. After that, my phone dies and it was roughly 7pm on the way back to his parents house. I shower, watch a movie, and it roughly 11pm and I remember my phone had died. I plug it in and receive multiple texts if I'm OK, where I'm at, and a phone call. Then the texts start to get rude from my dad saying ""Your mother told me you were shopping for her mother's day present, you better pull it together for her tomorrow whatever the hell you have been doing!"". Obviously he knew what I was doing and I have already bought her something. It was just rude and was sent after I told him I was OK and at my boyfriends parents house. 

Is all of this excessive or is it just me? How do I handle this? I don't have to check in when I'm with friends...and I didn't have to with my prior boyfriend.

So about a week and a half ago I met this super awesome girl.  We didn't really hit it off right away.  Guys were swarming all over her.  She asked for my number and we've been seeing eachother and talking on a regular basis ever since.

A few nights ago she met me at a concert and we hit it off right away.  Dancing, kissing, grinding, the works.  For the rest of that night we were holding hands, acting like we were together and it really felt ""right."" 
She ended up staying the night at my place.  We stared romantically into each other's eyes, kissed quite a bit, and fell asleep in each other's arms

This situation seems too good to be true, right? That's because it is.  
She went back to her hometown yesterday to apparently see her boyfriend, says her roommate.  She told me she was going to see and spend time with her family.  

I don't want to be wasting my time on a girl who could do the same thing to me, but at the same time I am really falling for her.  
How do I confront her about this (or should I even confront her about this)??

TITLE: So I bumped into a homeless guy and he spilled his drink... am I an asshole?

POST: I'm walking down the street in New York, and there's a steady stream of foot traffic going in either direction. Out of the corner of my eye, I'm watching people coming at me when I bump shoulders with a guy and hear a splat of what sounded like some kind of drink behind me. Recalling what I had previously seen, it looked to be an emaciated man carrying an old black plastic shopping bag that I had bumped shoulders with. Thinking nothing of it, I keep walking. Then I hear someone say ""excuse me"" from behind, and realize that I may have knocked the plastic bag out of the homeless-looking man's hand by mistake. Two thoughts pop into my head about what might have happened: 1) this guy is trying to scam me, and probably ""accidentally"" bumps into people and drops things all the time, hoping that they'll overcompensate him for what they've ""damaged"" 2) I genuinely knocked something out of this guy's hand. In the case of the latter scenario, my response is still going to be something like ""well, you should really carry your things away from oncoming traffic if they're that important to you,"" but I figure this homeless guy isn't the type who's going to listen to that kind of reasoning. So I ignore him. I pick up my pace to walk quickly like someone who's in a hurry, but not quickly enough that he could accuse me of trying to evade him. Then I hear ""excuse me"" again. At this point I'm thinking ""fuck, this guy is persistent, and he's definitely not the kind of person I want to get into an argument with on the street."" I also note that I'm only one block away from the subway station, so I decide to keep my pace up and continue to ignore him. I duck into the underground pathway leading to the turnstile and I hear it again, with heightened urgency: ""excuse me."" So I make a dash for the turnstile, swipe my card, and jump on the first train out of there.

POST: *I apologize for the shitty, nondescript title*

Girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now, both early 20s.  

She was in a LDR with a guy for 2 years, and cheated on him a few times with these two different guys.  She dated both of them separately for a bit, broke up, but still hung out with them afterwards.  

She maintains an awkward relationship with them, and they clearly want to hang out with her still (and are most definitely still into her).  She wants to hang out with them too.  I do not get along with these two guys, they are shady as all hell.

We have a good relationship now, but lately these guys have been popping up a lot more often and it has been causing me problems big time.  

Is this normal?  Am I being overly jealous, or is hanging out with guys you've cheated on your ex boyfriend with okay?  I also will be away from her for a few months pretty soon, and I'm worried something might happen while I'm gone.

TITLE: Is this fling fizzling?

POST: Both in our mid 20s. I have been sleeping with a girl for over a year now. We work together and when it started when she still had a boyfriend. It happened under circumstances I am not proud of.  She came to me when her relationship was fizzling out, and I think she needed me to see if there was any hope of re-igniting a flame of passion that she has not had in a while.  I was the other man for almost 6 months.  Then we decided that had to stop.  
We took a pause for a few months, but since we work together, we still constantly saw each other.  So when I find out she moved out of her shared apartment and broke up with her boyfriend, we start it up again. 

Things are great for a month, but then something happened.  I can't pinpoint it, but the passion is gone.  We both used to stare at each other with passion, and we used to make love with passion.  Over the past month, she has stopped doing anything romantic, surprising or spontaneous.  

I think I have a high sex drive, and I like to have sex everyday. For the first few months we had sex 3 times a day, but now, after about 4 months of this, we only have sex maybe 1-2 times a week.

I care about her a lot, and I was kind of hoping that it could be something more. She says she still isn't ready to get into a relationship, which I understand.  We had agreed at the start of this that we were just going to keep it to casual sex, but we both understood that we had feelings for each other. 

Not sure if I should just let her be for a while, move on or keep with it for a while longer.  Again, I felt like I was falling for this girl a few months ago, but I feel like now she is fighting it.

TITLE: TIFU by being an Insensitive Jerk

POST: So like many others, this happened last year but I am still mortified as our office just recently had a congratulatory card recently that reminded me of the tragedy. 

I work in a corporate office building, and many times theres a designated person that walks around getting all the employees to sign a happy birthday, get well, congratulations card. 
One day I was extremely busy with audits, reports, reviews, and the girl designated for this card signing approaches me. As I am multi-tasking, she in her ninja ways sneaked up and whispered, ""hey sign this"". without any saying anything else. I didnt take a very good look at the card, and opened it up, and didnt really read or even glance what other peoples comments are and what they wrote, the girl asking me to sign the card didnt say what its for. 
I signed Happy Birthday! Enjoy - My name, gave it back and went about my work.

15 minutes pass by and I get a minute to breathe, I overheard one of my staff members talk to another, saying, its so sad.. I hope they are doing ok... it was then that I noticed I fucked up. I immediately got up and asked them what they are talking about.. and they told me so and so's mother passed away. 

It hit me... I just wrote happy birthday on a condolences card... 

I told a few specific people in the office hoping they would relay my apologies to the person I decimated with my insensitivity, but I never worked up the courage to apologize to that person face to face. No one has said anything since, but I am sure they hate me deep down.

TL;DR:","  Was busy with work, sneaked up on a coworker asking me to sign a happy birthday card, didnt read what was written, overheard one of my coworkers say so and so's mother passed away.",  I was multi-tasking and not paying attention and wrote happy birthday into a condolences card for a co-worker.

TITLE: A bill paying trick that helps me track and lower monthly expenses.

POST: This may be obvious to some, but it has helped me get a much better picture of my finances. For years I struggled with paying bills, sometimes because of low income but just as often because I was disorganized. After making simple changes to my bank account structures I don't miss bills, have lowered my spending and can understand my expenses better.

The trick is pretty simple. Open a checking account for all your reoccurring expenses. Then go about setting them all on auto-pay. Most of the time you can connect the bank numbers or use a debit card to automate payment. If you need to pay an individual or have to pay by check most banks have a bill pay feature that will send scheduled payments by check.

At first you'll need to overpay into this account because your expenses estimate might be off and you need a buffered balance. After a couple of months you'll be able to pay in almost exactly what you need. Then you can setup automatic deposit to cover all your expenses.

Congratulations, your financial life is now completely automated. Did you remember to pay such and such bill? Yeah totally. Analyzing your accounts it looks like you're paying for a lot of online storage. Google sells space cheap. Consolidate accounts and save. Get hit with an unexpected bill? There's plenty of buffer in the account, just pay a bit more in to make up and move on.

It can take a while to move all your accounts over, but once you do the benefits of organization are massive. Also, once you make that one or two payments into the account per month (pay into it right when you get income) whatever remains is your spending / saving money.

TL;DR:",  Open a checking account for all your recurring expenses. Set them all on auto-pay and set up automatic deposit to cover all your expenses. You'll have a much better picture of your finances and lower monthly expenses.,"  Get an account for reoccurring expenses. Set the account to auto-pay all your bills, rent, car payments, etc. It's much easier to see how much you spend and much harder to forget to pay a bill."

TITLE: I [20 M] am confused about my feelings towards my best-friend of almost a year [24 F]

POST: I met my current best friend online almost a year ago and we just got along instantly. We shared personal thoughts and feelings and got to the point where we talk every day, usually multiple times. We'll watch TV shows together on Netflix, play video games together or just talk when we're bored. We live a couple hours away (by car) but have spent two weekends together in person and both had a great time. When I met her, she was in a long term relationship and I was totally happy with just being her friend. She's recently single and I have been struggling with trying to figure out if I just love her like a best friend or if I'm in love with her. 

I've dated a couple girls in the past but have never connected with one like I have her. I'm just afraid of regretting losing this opportunity to see if we want to be more than just friends. At the same time, I'm afraid of ""What if things didn't work out?"". I wouldn't want a failed relationship to ruin our friendship. While her last relationship of many years was a very long distance relationship (different country), I don't think she'd want to jump into another one even if I only live a couple hours away. When she was going through her break-up, which she is still slightly struggling with, I remained completely neutral and was very supportive of her to choose whatever option that makes her happy. I love her and all I want is for her to be happy. But now, I find myself being sad at random times over the confusion about my feelings. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do so I don't regret my choice in the future? I could tell her how I feel, I'm not really afraid of whether or not she feels the same but more afraid of how her not feeling the same way would affect our friendship. I know she uses Reddit just about as much as me, and she would totally know this is about her if she read it, so I'm going to just hope that doesn't happen. I didn't really know where else to go to ask for help.

TL;DR:",  I'm confused about my feelings towards my best friend of almost a year. She recently got out of a long term relationship and I'm afraid of regretting our friendship. Has anyone been in a similar situation?,  I'm not sure if I just love my best-friend like I should a good friend or if I'm in love with her.

TITLE: TIFU by writing a fake TIFU

POST: So, I thought I'd see how easy it could be to write a fake and yet relatively believable TIFU.

About an hour and a half ago I had finished my masterpiece, ready to deceive all of you. This fake story involved me having sexual intercourse with two of my cousins a couple of years ago and some supposed pictures I'd taken on a disposable camera which i'd kept. The fake story went on, detailing how while I was away my mother decided to develop the pictures on said fake camera, as in this made up world we'd recently lost some family photos and she had hoped there would be some on there. In this fake story of course she went mad once eyed been developed and she's seen the non existent photos. 

So now you know about the fake story, I can go back to when I'd just finished writing it - happy with my work, I went downstairs and decided to take the dog for a walk, i was about 35 minutes. I get back, my computer was off - all cords unplugged, everyone out of the house, phone off the hook. Clearly, one, or all of my parents have read this and phoned someone or something. Sorry this is terribly written I'm writing this from my phone and not in the most coherent state right now. How the fuck do I explain this one..

TITLE: Is stashing a bag of dirt in my sister's luggage a bad idea?

POST: My sister and I have a game that's been going on for the last decade or so where we hide a bag of dirt among each others possessions.  She's going travelling in the fall and I wanted to hide it in her luggage so she'd have to cart it around for the two and a half months she's planning on going for.  I was wondering about possible implications with customs, other than a few odd looks.  She's going to Australia and the Philippines for sure as well as a couple other countries in southeast asia and I assume she'll pass through the US.  Would she get any grief about bringing in foreign contaminants or whatever?  I realize she could just throw the bag out if need be, but I don't really want that to happen.  It's a small ziplock bag of very dry soil with a bit of mulch in it, probably less than 25 grams total (<1 ounce).

TITLE: Boyfriend (24M) thinks I (18F) should be 'better' than him? What..?

POST: A little about both of us:

Together for 6 months. Its been a great learning experience for both of us and we come from similar backgrounds with a lot in common, however

I tend to push him in areas where he lacks like school and work. He appreciates it and says he wouldn't be where he was without me, however, he nags me CONSTANTLY about going to the gym (I go twice a day), my eating habits(vegan), sleeping habits, and grades. His are admittedly much worse than mine.

When I tell him ""I like you the way you are and I want you to want to improve yourself first. I don't feel like I have the authority to tell you those things""' he tells me he holds me to a higher standard than himself.

I've encouraged him to come on runs with me (he's lucky enough to be in great shape, but who doesn't want to look and feel better) buy him protein drinks to bulk up ( he says he wants to) , left him alone to study, make goals for the future to work harder, encouraged him to hang out with friends, etc, and he sits in the house all day and brushes it off.

What do I do if I finish college before him (which is likely) or bypass him in any areas of life later down the road? How do I make him want to be better before I think I'm too good for him and leave? Is this even normal?

TITLE: My [17 M] new girlfriend's [16 F] parents won't let us see each other

POST: So me and this girl began seeing each other about a month ago, and have gotten quite serious quite fast and we are completely head over heels for each other.

The problem here is that we never get to see each other due to how overprotective of her parents are, she is literally never allowed outside the house . At first this wasn't too much of an issue, we'd skype everyday, she'd see me for 10/15 minutes after school at my bus stop (even this was limited as my friends would be there). Recently though, her parents have found out about me, and deemed that I am too much of a distraction from her studies, and that she is no longer allowed to see me or even Skype me.

We're now questioning where this relationship is going, and if there is anything we can do, because we're both so desperate at this moment in time. Unfortunately at this point she doesn't seem to be willing to lie to her parents so that's out of the question at the moment.

TITLE: I [M/18] am fed up with one of my friends'[M/19] behaviour. Am I thinking to much about this ?

POST: So, I have been friends with this guy since 6th grade. Because he lives 14km away and went to a different school than I we only talk online in voice chat room and meet IRL sometimes at a party or go for a movie night with some othe guys. But since we both finished school this year and there is a 3-4 month period of nothing to do between end of school and university starting, we have been hanging out online every day. He is rather slow and relaxed, but gets pissed really quick if something is not to his liking, which, while playing online games, happens quite often.

 Now most of the time I am not the target of this, but when he sees me as the cause of his anger and lashes out towards me, I react and it ends with us shouting and one of us leaving. This happend about 4 times in 7years but when it does, he goes into his sulking phase where he activly avoids me and then after a week or so, when I want to talk to him, tells me that he needed ""time away from me"". And when he goes into his sulking phase I just know that this is the phrase I am going to hear sooner or later. The cause of our anger are seldom big matters, for example I joined a rival clan of his because they asked me to be a member while his clan rejected me although I know their leader IRL. Trivial, right ? Or I denied knowing two close friends of his in front of a group of new people I met, because they made neo-nazi statements.
The current event was about him thinking of me as urging him to hurry up after he made some friends and myself needlessly wait on him and me calling him out on that.

So, r/relationship_advice. Are these just normal clashes among friends ? Am I thinking to much into it ? Should I change my behaviour ? As someone who doesnt become friends with someone easily and values his friendships above all, this is an important matter to me.

TL;DR:","  My friend gets angry easily and when something goes wrong, we usually end up fighting. He says he needs time away from me and when he goes into his sulking phase I know it is coming. Am I thinking too much ?","  Long time gaming/IRL friend actively avoids me for a week after small fights, returns saying that he needed time away from me.

TITLE: 17/m I'm the other guy, need help.

POST: Hi, I am a 17 year old guy in junior year of highschool, and the other day I might have done something not all that great. I have this friend named (lets call her Patrice) who has this really shitty boyfriend(lets call him Doug) who has forced her to do some really terrible things, for instance he forced her to suck his dick, and when she asked to stop, he told her to shut up and consistently sends dick pics to other girls. To further add details on this, she's extremely dependant on him and fears to be alone which is why she hasn't ended up breaking up with her. So, anyways, my friends have been trying to hook me up with her because they want her to stop dating him, I didn't really know much about her except for that she is really fucking hot, so of course I agreed. I invited a bunch of friends over to my house to have a party. Most of them didn't end up coming, but Patrice did. We were chatting it up, until I made the grave mistake of asking her to make out (don't judge me i'm an idiot).  She was hesitant, but looked at her friend for confirmation. She, the friend, said its fine, which then led up to Patrice saying don't tell Doug (I don't really know the name suits him), so we made out. Afterwards, she felt really guilty because she still thought that she still loved him even with all the things he has done. My friends still want me to go out with her, but I don't really know how to approach it. Any advice would be great.

TITLE: Am I (19f) selfish for being worried about my boyfriend's (18m) sudden lack of concern about school?

POST: We've been dating for a little over a year, and recently he started to smoke weed again (he stopped at the beginning of our relationship because I had a problem with it, but now I don't mind, it's up to him, ya know?), and since then he's started to really care less about school. He hasn't gone to a single class in over a month, he sits around smoking and playing video games. I'm afraid for him, he had kind of a rough fall semester, and if he doesn't maintain a certain GPA he gets kicked out completely of the college. I really don't want to see him mess up like this, but the few times I've tried to bring it up, he tells me not to worry, he can make his own decisions, he'll be fine, etc. Of course I'm genuinely worried for *him*, and what his life will be like if he does flunk out but I'm also worried for personal reasons. Whenever he gets stressed, he tends to be kind of a jerk to me for a while. I get ignored, lashed out at, he doesn't want to be around me, and things like that which is one of the reasons I'm worried - no one likes being a target. I'm also worried because if he flunks out, he'll have to return home and that would effect our relationship. We've had disagreements about other things and he's told me that I tend to be really selfish in our relationship (even when I don't think I am), but am I selfish for being concerned about his school because of how it would affect us? Is there anything I can try to do to make him get his stuff together?

POST: About 10 months ago my GF(20F) of 1 year told me(27M) about her past as an escort.  It was completely against her will and started as just rapes organized by her at the time BF.   I thought I had dealt with this.  Literally didn't think about it for months now.  

Then we were watching Drive and she started acting funny when the shoot out started and as he's holding the girl down on the motel bed.  She was reacting to the gun violence, but it triggered my mind.  And it all came flooding back.  To be clear I'm not upset with her.  Never blamed her, still don't.  Her life was hell and when you have no support bad stuff happens easily.

However I can't stop thinking about wanting to bring harm to her ex.  I've caught myself looking for him as I drive to work (he works down the street) again.  Literally feeling sick today that this guy is out there walking around enjoying life like nothing happened.  Also upset with myself that I am this obsessed with wanting to crush someone's world when I've never even met him.

I love this girl to death, she means everything to me.  She's off her meds now and dealing with it herself so she's not as willing to talk about it at the moment.  So I feel completely stuck.  I've dealt with it before but I had her help.

Anyone have any advice?  We move 1.5 hours from home into an apartment together in 4 days so at least driving by the motels she used to be taken to is not going to be an issue anymore.  But that guy is still just down the street.

TITLE: Me [35F] with my husband[40M] and parents [60sF/M], married 10 years, Thanksgiving plans crisis

POST: My husband and I have been married 10 years and have two kids under 6. We live about 90 minutes from my parents. I'm not super-close with them but generally have a good relationship. 

For the last few years, we've hosted my parents and sister for Thanksgiving. We enjoy cooking and hosting, and honestly it's easier and more comfortable for the kids. We were going to do the same this year. 

But this year, plans are suddenly up in the air because:

* My mom just got out of  the hospital for something fairly serious, and is a little iffy on making the drive.

* My sister moved out-of-state over the summer and is driving back on Thanksgiving, but won't make it to their place until around 5 in the evening. My house is even further.

So my parents would like to host this year, both to save them the drive and so Sis can be at the dinner more easily. My husband says dinner can be at their house but he wants to make the turkey. I told my parents this and they basically think it's a lot of trouble. I also think it's a lot of trouble and borderline rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband was pissy when I told him this. My suggestion he talk to them and work it out did not go over well. (Possibly because I was pissy about him being pissy by that point.)

So, what should I tell my parents to avoid this turning into a huge fight where everybody feels insulted? I honestly don't care who makes the stupid turkey as long as I get to eat some.

TL;DR:","  Husband and I host Thanksgiving dinner at parents house, mom just got out of hospital and is a little iffy on making the drive, sister moving out-of-state and won't make it until 5pm.",  Husband wants to make T'giving turkey. Parents also want to host meal. How do I keep everybody happy?

POST: I have known this girl for about a year, and I am certain I like her and I am almost certain she likes me. She has done all kinds of things convince me she likes me. 

We had food together (just the two of us) a few weeks ago, she got tinder the moment I mentioned it in a conversation, and she kissed me on the neck and cheek at a party the other week. There seems to have been some attempts to make me jealous. My friends mentioned her and another friend was about to go into a relationship when that clearly wasn't the case, they were both clearly not really into it. When I was mentioned in a similar context she almost died of embarrassment (she hid under her arms for a few minutes and went bright pink). We have also told each other very deep and painful parts of our lives, and she has been very good with me about it and said she would always be there for me.

However, I think I have not been responding in the right way. When she kissed me I was tipsy and quite shocked so I didn't kiss her back like I really wanted to. I also told her I didn't want a GF a few months ago, when I did but thought that she was too high up socially, and later on she said she didn't want a BF for very similar reasons to me. I also got interrupted today so I didn't get a chance to ask her out like I wanted to. She seems to have been quite down in the dumps this week, and I have only talked to her twice. She told me some sad things about her and I wanted to hug her so badly, but If I had I think I would have been laughed at by others.

I really haven't got any idea of what to do, and I don't see her again until Monday at least. I don't want to ask her out by text since that is really impersonal. Ideas?

TITLE: Am I [18F] overreacting about my boyfriend's [20M] relationship with his past fling?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a while, but had a breakup in January after he started his first semester at a new school. During the time we were broken up, he had a fling with a girl over a period of close to two months. He would spend the night at her apartment frequently but as far as I know, it didn't progress past making out and some groping. She admitted she had feelings for him, and he ended the physical part of their relationship because he didn't feel the same way. We got back together in late June.

My issue here is that they are still best friends, and he hangs out with her, or her and her roommates (who are also his friends), nearly every day. I'm not a jealous person when it comes to his other female friends, but because of him being back in the place where our relationship ended and his physical involvement with this other girl began, I can't stop feeling horrible. I trust him, and I love him, but I don't know her well enough to trust her. His opinion is that I need to just ""get over it,"" but that's been really difficult. I asked him if he could potentially cut down on the time he spends with her to two to five days a week instead of every day, which he felt was an ""unreasonable request.""

I know I'm being jealous, but the amount of time he spends with this girl is really bothering me, and the way it's causing me to feel is putting our relationship in danger. Help?

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here it goes.

So this past week I was in a foreign country with some friends. We went to a club one night and met a group of girls and shared a table with them. 

This one girl and I started dancing and in no time we were making out. I don't know for how long, could have been 5 minutes, could have been 30 (too drunk to remember). I don't remember how we were separated either. 
We were supposed to meet them again the day after, but for some reason we were late and many of them just went home. She didn't though. 

They were three girls who had waited for us. We went to a bar that night and I sat down next to her. We talked, but the conversation didn't go to any personal level. 

We ended that night with a quick hug. The day after I (and my group of friends) went back home. I added her on facebook.

It has now been 4 days since the night we were making out and I just feel so empty. Now I'm always tired and quiet and just can't stop thinking about her. I want to write to her, but I don't even know if she feels the same way. 

So my questions are

If yes, what do I write?

TITLE: Reddit, how can I deal with my bitchy roommate?

POST: I live in a two bedroom apartment with two girls in each room bedroom. Recently, one of the girls from the other room decided that the best way to tell us things was through passive-aggressive notes put in certain places as seen here:  (those are not the only ones). 

On top of that, she now decides that she hates my boyfriend because he comes over too often (in MY room, where she doesn't even have to see him), and because he doesn't lock the door when he leaves. She has called him a ""douchebag"", ""faggot"", ""dick"", etc. straight to my face, and told me to tell him to go home. She has no reason to even think that because all he's ever been is respectful to her and has even done favors for him.

The thing is, if she had been nice about it and told me directly that she had problems with something, I would be much more susceptible to change. But when she simply leaves notes all over the place and then blows up and bitches people out when things don't change, I have no respect for her.

What should I do? :/

TITLE: Is there a chance that I [19/m] am screwing this up with my (19/f) girlfriend?

POST: We've developed an extremely strong semi-long distance relationship. She only drinks on very few occasions and only smokes hookah every once in a while. I smoke weed/tobacco, drink, and do other drugs almost daily. She says she doesn't care, but I still refuse to smoke a tobacco product in front of her. We both fully plan on staying together throughout college and eventually ending up together. She seems to truly not care and we both believe that I will calm down as I develop more of a routine and grow up, and I believe that at this age if we are to stay together this age is the last chance I have to do these 'wild' things.

TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 7 years have vastly different sexual pleasures. Is this something that will become a constant sore point for the rest of our lives?

POST: Me and my long term girlfriend have been together for a little over 7 years now. We have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years due to our studies. We long our virginities to each other and from there we began to explore a bit.

I have been watching porn for 10 years and have built up various fetishes and sexual desires. My girlfriend on the other hand had barely begun to touch herself when we met and had little to no idea about what she liked or what she wanted to try. So we used my 'knowlegde' to try several things and see what we liked.

During this time we tried several things ranging from your normal passionate sex to public sex and from mild bdsm to anal. What became clear after several years of exploring is that we both have quite different tastes. She prefers passionate normal sex and occasionally being restrained. I'm into things such as anal play and exhibitionism. She is very specific about what she likes now and I'm still very open and willing to do pretty much anything. This is starting to bring a bit of conflict as I become bored with all of these restrictions she has now put in place so that she stays in her comfort zone.

It's difficult for us both to enjoy sex to its fullest extent at the same time as I want to do certain things that she won't do and she wants to do things that we've done a thousand times and don't really excite me anymore.

I'm not going to pack in the relationship over this as I love her and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I want to know if this is going to be a source of conflict for the rest of our relationship, and if anyone has any advice or ideas regarding this?

TL;DR:",  Me and my long term girlfriend have vastly different sexual tastes. She prefers passionate normal sex and I prefer anal play and exhibitionism. This is starting to cause strain in our otherwise loving relationship. Is this something to worry about?,  Me and my girlfriend are into different things in a sexual sense.

TITLE: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?

POST: Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). 
* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.
* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. 

What do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.

TITLE: TIFU by accidentally overdosing on dextroamphetamine (ADD medication) on the day of my endwork presentation. [NSFW]

POST: So yesterday was a rough day. I still had a LOT of work to do, things like making the actual scale model of the home design I presented today and the powerpoint presentation.

I was able to make a presentable presentation, but only got 4 hours of sleep because of it. I think the lack of sleep is what caused my body to be incapable of processing my normally prescribed dosage this morning.

So today as I arrived at school I already knew I was sweating a hell of a lot more than I was supposed to. Feeling cold and sweaty is a miserable feeling. Though I assumed it was just a common cold or something. That all changed when I checked my armpits. Seriously I regret wearing a gray shirt today.

My armpits were just *drained* with sweat.

I could feel the sweat drip down my arm pits drop by drop every minute, what just made more nervous. After an hour my sweater was no longer able to contain the sweat, and it was so visible I didn't even need to lift my arms for people to notice. It didn't make me feel awkward towards my friends, I just laugh it off with them.

But then it was time for me to present my design to the external jury. 7 well respected teachers and architects gave me 30 min of their time for me to defend my work.

I just know that they noticed it and it distracted them and it distracted me. Too awkward for them to mention it. Too awkward for me to not ignore it. Yet I accepted the awkwardness and was able to give a somewhat terrible presentation because I got verbal ticks along with the overdose. But they loved the design at least after I explained everything twice.

After school was done I took a piss before I went home, which was also a bad idea. It felt like passing a kidney stone and gave me a throbbing painful erection for a good 30 minutes.

Now here I am, sitting at home because I can't stop sweating, feeling exhausted, heartbeat still around 100.
I'm just having a bad day.

TL;DR:",  Overdosed on dextroamphetamine (ADD medication) on the day of my endwork presentation. Awkwardness ensued.,"  Overdose, Cold and sweaty, Verbal ticks, during and after my cringe-worthy presentation. Having a bad day."

POST: I only need/ can use advice about defending myself.  
  
Back story:  
I serve in the military (not US) right now, and have lately been threatened by someone, after an unfortunate exchange of insults.  
I am noticeably bigger than him, and none of us have practiced martial arts, other than basic melee training in the military itself.  
  
I tried to defuse the situation more than once.  
I can't ""snitch"" about it, because that would create hostility between me and his friends.  
I am near this guy 24 hours a day for the next 6 weeks.  
I cannot go on the offense in any shape or form, otherwise I will be sent into military prison and loose a bunch of hard earned privileges.  
My only hope to come out clean is to take a beating and wait until a superior comes to defuse the situation, with the other guy being sent to military prison and such.

POST: In three months I'll be leaving for Navy boot camp; in boot camp you can write letters daily, but that's effectively it for communication on the outside. Now, I'm sure we'll make it on fine through it, seeing as we're a very strong couple and the letters will make it much much more doable, but I was wondering if there's anything I could do or could send before (or after) those two weeks come, because I know it's going to be stressful on her part.

TITLE: I (20'sM) think my cousin is going to tell me she (30'sF) is having a kid, I'm worried that my true feeling will show.

POST: My cousin is very close, like a sister, we were raised together.

She announced a few months ago that she and her long-time BF (30s) wanted to have a kid despite the fact that she has for her entire life said that she never wanted kids (we both had rough childhoods).

She has invited me and my Dad over to her and her BF's place for dinner next week, despite the fact that she almost never initiates those kinds of things, and that their money is pretty tight at the moment.

Other things (including the weird dinner invitation) have led me to believe that she is going to announce something big, and one of the few things I can think of are that she is pregnant.

I, for various reasons, don't think her (or her BF) would make good parents. I'm not going to argue with them about it, or make a big scene, or even make mention of my feelings. It's their decision, and nothing I say or do is going to change their decision.

What I'm worried about is hurting their feelings by not being immediately happy for them. She is kind of emotionally fragile, and uh... Histrionic?

I'm not good at hiding or faking emotions like this... It really has me worried. What can I do?

POST: I'll keep this short:

I've been hooking up with this girl for half a year now, and we've only been official last month. When we were just fooling around, I told her that if she ever hooked up with other guys, I just wanted to know that she used protection.

There's this one guy in question that she said she blacked out and can't be completely sure, but she thinks she did. I trusted her and we ended up dating.

Now I find out from her friend (who screenshot their text conversation) that she did NOT use protection during that night in question. She clearly wrote it to her friend.

I feel like my trust was betrayed. I'm a little disgusted with this. She probably didn't want to tell me because she wanted to keep seeing me (and now we're dating), but she knows I'm serious about these things and I can't believe this happened.

Beyond that, we've been pretty solid.

So like an idiot i fooled around behind her back with a few girls and she later found out, and by later I mean 2 years later when I finally confessed.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my GF[24 M/F] of 2 1/2 years, broke up and I do not know how to analyze my emotions.

POST: We were college sweethearts and we always had a solid relationship. She is the shy nervous type, but I loved that about her. After 1 year and 7 months I had to move for school, which led into a long distance relationship.

The distance really was difficult for both of us. She worked a night schedule and I worked a day schedule but we still managed to call every night. After a while, I tried to convince her to move to my side of the state. She did not really like her job that much (under payed) and I had a hard time finding a job on her side of the state (2 hours away). 

She expressed a feeling of not knowing what she wanted to do with her career, leading her to not be able to commit looking for work near me. She was always really nervous with decisions and really feared drastic change. So I didn't push her, even though the distance was getting too both of us. She has to do whats best for her.

Suddenly, that excuse ended up ending the relationship. She acted distant randomly as I visited her for the week (this was later in the week) and I called her out on it. She told me she doesn't know what she wants for her life and wants to be alone at this point in her life. She told me she loved me and as I left her house, I told her I hope shes finds what makes her happy and that I loved her. We were both in tears as I walked down her porch.

It has been a week since then and I am up-and-down each day. Happy,Sad,Confident, Self-loathing, miserable, ecstatic and most of all confused. I do still love her and I really don't know how to analyze what I am feeling. The breakup was out of nowhere. I just want to know that this type of things happens..because I personally don't understand it completely.

TITLE: I [25M] cannot be myself around my family, because everything I do is ""strange"".

POST: I am a senior biochemistry major, enjoy old music - huge deadhead- and really love writing. However, my family is nothing like me. They are narrow-minded straight ticket Republican voters, none of them have ever gone to college, and they all love modern pop country music; not that I mind, I just think that says a lot about a person.

Now, I could deal with those differences if they stopped there. The deeper issues are grounded in their ignorance of my intrinsic personality and their obstinacy towards simply trying to understand. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features in high school and then Bipolar 1 later on. On many days, all I can do is lie in the dark and list reasons to continue living.

This frequent inability to do anything is viewed as lazy by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. However, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.

I have stayed with friends on multiple occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.

I really just want to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented on. How do I get out of this mindset and become the person I want to be?

TL;DR:","  I have major depression and bipolar disorder, and my family is completely ignorant of my personal history and constantly interrogate me about it.

July of last year, my friend was texting me constantly on her roadtrip. Her friend rolled their car and my friend was rushed to the hospital and went into a coma for a few weeks. She ended up being ok but I originally thought she was ignoring me or lost service. In September, I was texting a friend of mine when she fell asleep and died in a house fire. I didn't know about the fire until a few days later, I kept texting her thinking she was ignoring me. Two months ago, I had text my friend in the morning and he agreed to meet me at my house later that afternoon to hang out. When he didn't show up, I kept texting him and calling him. I thought he was ignoring me, turns out he had killed himself a few hours before. 

Now whenever I'm texting someone and they don't reply within a few hours I freak out. I panic, start crying, call them, call someone who might know if they are still alive/ok. Basically full blow panic attacks. It's really embarrassing when they tell me to stop freaking out they just fell asleep/lost their phone/were riding unicorns. Should I talk to someone about this?

POST: BF and I are headed on a two week vacation to Europe, leaving Friday. We have lived together for six months, been together two years, and many of our friends are now married or engaged. 

Getting engaged on vacation seems to be en vogue these days. So now, I've had multiple friends, and most recently my father(!) as me if we're getting engaged on this trip. 

This is terrible for a number of reasons. 

1) Thanks friends for putting that thought in my mind!! 
2) How do I know?

He is financially comfortable, we are both at stable places in our lives, and we are very happy. So is he going to do it? 

But I also don't know if he is ready, and that is fine with me! I would very enthusiastically say yes if he asked, but I wouldn't want to actually tie the knot until at least 2016.

i.e., I'm listening to music on my computer, next to a window that is very minimally open.  I'm about 50 or more feet away from the cars driving past, but when they do, my music goes into a muffled sound and I can't make out the words being sung.

Additionally, talking to people, I'm constantly being asked to repeat myself.  I'm also been told to turn the TV down pretty often.

TITLE: I [F22] just started dating my friend [M23] and I'm uncomfortable by his attitude towards his female friends/other women.

POST: So my friend and I recently decided to start dating. We had a casual, non-exclusive relationship for a few weeks, and last night I told him I wanted to be exclusive.

The thing is, he talks a lot about how attracted he is to other women. He told me pretty much any time a woman is wearing X or Y, regardless of who she is, he'll be horny. He keeps a lot of female friends on Facebook simply so he can look at their pictures (and I guess masturbate to them, I dunno, based on what he's told me before). He still talks to his ex's. 

And last night, after I had said I wanted to be exclusive and we were talking about something else, he said something along the lines of, ""The physical half of my would fuck anyone who would fuck me. I'd fuck a pile of dirt if it felt good.""

Am I weird for being upset by this? I understand being attracted to other people is part of life, and that doesn't bother me. I don't mind him watching porn or anything like that. It's the attitude of being willing to fuck pretty much anything that moves, having sexual feelings towards his female friends… I guess it's more personal than I'm comfortable with.

It just made me feel really shitty. Is this normal? Am I supposed to be okay with this stuff? I don't think he'd cheat on me, but I guess it makes me feel like sex with him is nothing special, and I don't like that feeling in a relationship. All of this just came to light last night after I told him I wanted to be exclusive. If I had known this stuff beforehand, I'm not sure I would've jumped into it.

TITLE: Utility Payments that aren't really mine

POST: Good Morning/Afternoon r/advice, 

Never posted on Reddit before at all, but I figured (based on the overall reliability of you nice individuals) that now would be a good time to start. 

About a year ago I moved away from my Midwest town to the west coast for work, and have just recently moved back. I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. 

I am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that. I was alarmed however when  I was told that the value was around $500.00 from a home that I shared with friends in college. They stated that this amount was accrued in 2013.

I have spent the last 3 days trying to find the exact time when we moved from that specific house ( it was college, so we had a new place basically every year) and just now found out that the lease was over on 05/31/2012. Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously ""managed"" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). 

My question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have? I cannot afford to pay it, but I also don't think that it should be on me TO pay it. Any advice is truly appreciated as I have not had any experience with this type of thing before.

TL;DR:","  Someone else took over residency and didn't cancel utilities, I found out 3 days ago and am unsure of my legal responsibility for the fees. What can I do?","  Didn't cancel gas from a house in college. People lived there afterwards using gas in my name. I ""owe""$500.00 but can validate that I did not live there at that time."

TITLE: Any hope for the elusive lesbian man? (20 M/MtF)

POST: For most of my life I was pretty hopeless about dating, mostly because I could not be myself when with women; I put on a man act because I was afraid of losing their interest.

I thought I was gay, but the only thing I'm missing is an enjoyment for sex with men.  I've tried it many times and couldn't stay hard.  I was resigned to being a foreveralone with no hope and I was pretty hopeless about life.

I used to joke to myself about being a lesbian in a man's body, but it turns out that's not far from the truth.  I'm going to be transitioning and living as a female in the next 6-12 months with the help of hormones and a lot of work, but I feel like I am unable to form meaningful relationships with women in the mean time.

I don't find straight women that appealing because they prefer, and expect, masculinity from me and assume the submissive role that I would normally take in a relationship.  But while dating a lesbian girl who assumes the dominant role would be perfect, they don't find me attractive now and may lesbians seem to have a militant aversion to trans women.

It seems that either I somehow must act masculine and have women attracted to me (hasn't worked, would rather play in traffic) or I be myself and no one will want me for at least another 1-2 years when I presumably pass as a woman at some level.  How can I make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time?

TL;DR:",  I'm going to be transitioning from male to female soon and I'm struggling to form meaningful relationships with women.  Any hope for the elusive lesbian man?,  I am the woman in the relationship but I am presenting as a male.  Will any straight women find my personality attractive?  Is my only hope lesbian-leaning bisexual girls?  Any advice for making it work?

TITLE: Me 26M I haven't met anyone else after my live-in ex two years ago

POST: She was my first serious long term partner and eventually cheated on me.  Our breakup was shitty, and we didn't really remain friends.

It took a while to ""get over it"" but since then I knew I was ready and open to date someone new.  I really wanted to be in love again and find someone I could share my life with. But in the two years I've been single: I just haven't. 

It sucks, because I see tons of attractive women, I meet lots of interesting people, and I know rationally there are a lot of people out there that would make good matches.  So it doesn't make any sense to me why I haven't been able to meet anyone that I've felt romantic about in longer than I can remember.

At this point I feel like I've kind of resigned myself against the possibility of meeting anyone anytime soon.  I've had FWB's, dated a few people for a while, but just haven't dated anyone that I've felt a romantic connection with.

For the past year, I tried to just not put any pressure on it and just let it happen.  But at the same time, it seems like it's starting to feel like it's been a long time, and at this point I'd really like to love someone.

Anyway, at my current trajectory, I could easily see myself going down this path for the next five or ten years.  I'm not really sure what to do.  I lift weights and am in pretty good shape, but I don't really seem to attract the kind of people I'm attracted to (so basically, attractive women, making me like every other dude).

Anyway, I thought about this because recently my ex friended me on facebook and, while it wasn't a serious thing (she's had a new bf for a while now), I wrote her last week just to catch up and she immediately unfriended me and never replied.  I kind of sat there thinking like ""man.  My love life is such shit.  All I have after the last two years is the hope of friendship with a woman who wants nothing to do with me, and I still can't find anyone I'm attracted to to date.""

TL;DR:",  Haven't been able to meet anyone new since my messy breakup two years ago.  I'm pretty sure there are tons of attractive women out there but I haven't been able to find anyone I'm attracted to.,"  Feeling down because I just haven't met anyone I've been romantically interested in since my ex girlfriend.

TITLE: TIFU by renting my apartment to the weedman

POST: Last week I rented 1 out of 2 rooms to my weedman and his girlfriend. It was only supposed to be till the end of September. 

Sunday noon this guys calls me and tells me 
""Hey man, my girlfriend left me. I'm not going to stay at apartment anymore, I want my money back!""

I don't really have backup funds for emergency situations like this due to the fact that I just started working as an apprentice one year ago. My mother pays for the apartment.

Now here is where the fuck up happened. He payed me around 500€ for one month. The rent was already payed and I decided to spent the money on clothes, electronics, booze and of course some herbs. And I also didn't tell my mother about. 

This dude has the key for the main lock to the apartment. Unfortunately this is a universal key. He can open the door to the building, to my mail and the door. Fortunately I didn't give the key for the second lock. 

After trying to tell him that I don't have his money, he went berserk. He threatened me via text and phone calls. 

I panicked. Closed both locks. Went to my parents house, because I didn't really felt safe there anymore. My parents are out of town till the end of September and I beg to God that I can sort this situation out. 

My mother will probably kill me if she finds out, the dealer most likely too. Drugs are bad mkay kids?

TITLE: TIFU by standing up to the school jerk.

POST: I am a college student in a very small Institute. (Graduation class of less than 50) Well there is this particular guy who is the biggest jerk of the school. He has to ""one up"" everybody and is constantly demeaning and disrespectful. 

Well, this particular discussion began over the recent tragedy involving Robin Williams death.

He had mentioned the incident and said that those who take their own lives are ""Shameless Cowards"" and those people shouldn't waste time on Earth if they can't handle life. Also the families and loved ones of those individuals should be ashamed and embarrassed.

I then was very upset and told him that I have had people very close to me take their own lives, and You can imagine what that person must have been dealing with. He proceeded to say they were simply weak. At this point I went off and can't remember everything that was said. Well a nosey student went and told a director that I was Verbally assaulting an innocent student. (of course) this student was an underclassmen who did not know the situation nor the history of this person. They also lied and exaggerated the story.

I was called into a meeting where I was suspended for the next 3 days. Upon my return on Monday I have a meeting with the program Director to discuss further repercussions, aka Expulsion from a College I have paid to go to. 

This college is a joke. The teachers act like high school students and gossip like no teenage I've ever met. the favoritism and exaggeration is outrageous. I am being threatened with expulsion on the false grounds of bulling with no proof of the entire incident and the guy that was involved didn't even come forward to complain about it because it was simply a heated discussion in which were both involved.

I guess the lesson here is, You can't stand up to Bullies because you look like a bully and then are kicked from a bullshit college that you have paid $30,000 to attend.

Yesterday, I checked my bank account online after my card was not accepted for a payment. Turns out I have a balance of -$60 on my debit card because of a purchase done on a subscription I didn't even know I had subscribed to. I only had 0.23¢ (irresponsible, I know) on my bank account, and the subscription costed $12. So apart from the $12 fee, I got an overdraft fee of -$34, and another more for -$15 after not paying the first fee a week after I got it. So now I have a $60 fee, and I have no idea if it will affect my credit or my debit in any way. I do not have a credit card, I have never had any, and I plan to pay the debt today. Will this fee affect me and my credit in any way?

TITLE: I (20F) was a horrible person in a relationship because of my past

POST: My boyfriend (19M)  broke up with me (20F), after an 8 month relationship, a little over a month ago. The break up was bad. I was hysterical and acted like a child. At first I did not know why he had broken up with me (his answers to my questions were not very clear). 

After a while, and a little soul searching, I realized that out relationship fell apart because of my need to be in control. I was constantly nagging him to do things and I constantly micro-managed not only my life, but also his. 

I have been going to counseling ever since the break up. It has made me realize that my behavior comes from a controlling parent. I do not want to be controlling and am working on living life without worry about something not going right. So far, I am actually enjoying my life more than I have in a very long time.

I had not thought about my ex for quite a while. About a week after the break up I decided that it was time for me to pull my life back together. Now that I am feeling much better, I have started thinking about him again. I would like to try again in a relationship with him. I am sure he is angry and hurt by the way I treated him. I do not want to have the same relationship we had because if it did not work once, it is not going to work again. I could go give him  the whole ""I've changed"" speech, but I feel like I need to say something different than that. I do not know what to do to try and win him back, and let him know I actually want to have a good, healthy relationship.

That was a pretty average day,  I've done 2 pints of ice cream no problem, but now I'm trying to slow down on my sugar intake. I don't calorie count. 

Eating right seems to focus on creating healthy yet delicious meals. But that's not me, the tastiness doesn't outweigh the time spent making. I just want to get what I need. Hence why I eat so much fast food and junk. Need x amount of carbs? Drink this it takes no time prepping. Need x amount of protein? Take this pill and you're good for the day. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to take shortcuts, I just don't care for food and the more time needed to make a meal the less likely I'll do it.

POST: Someone I hang out with but that I don't know very well put me down as a personal reference for a car loan, and the dealership (a national chain known for financing people with bad credit) called and left me a voicemail to call them back.

He also recently started his own business, but I have no idea how well it may or may not be doing financially.

So I guess if I called the car dealership back, I wouldn't have anything good to say about his financial situation. To me, it seems like he has no money, but I don't want to tank his chance at getting a car. Should I call back and lie, call back and tell the truth, or just not call back at all?

TITLE: He doesn't trust me because he's cheating on me. Duh.

POST: Seriously, I'm an idiot for getting myself into this.

When I fall in love I just automatically give the person the benefit of the doubt, and my trust. Y'know, I thought if you love someone then that automatically means you should be able to trust them. If he tells me he doesn't trust me because he's scared, I'd just believe that shit without a second thought. 

Am I really that much of an idiot to just believe that? This guy is totally fucking around, I can't believe I'd be stupid enough to believe otherwise just because of love and just because *I'm* faithful. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

But now, I'm just going to numb myself out. I'm really good at that. I'm going to constantly assume the worst. I'm going to allow myself to keep falling in love with him (because honestly I couldn't stop myself if I tried) and I'm going to stay just as faithful as I've been this entire time, *but I'm not trusting him for shit*. Fuck that.

I already know what's coming. I've probably been getting played since the beginning, and I'm definitely being played now. I'd be a fucking idiot to think this guy actually loves me. 

I mean really, why did I think I was special? What made me think I was so special that he would want to be with me exclusively? I only believed it because that's what I wanted, but what the fuck? Could I be a bigger fucking idiot? Damn.

I'm just going to enjoy it while it lasts. Sooner or later it'll get more obvious that I'm being used and I'll be discarded, or the betraying will become apparent. Whatever comes first. So at least for now I can love him without being fully aware of how I'm being fucked.

It'll actually be cool to get my heart broken because then I can really numb out. Any faith I have in people would be sucked out and replaced with cold detachment. I'll shut people out of my heart in the name of defense. If I don't trust anyone to begin with, then they would have no chance to fuck me over. Awesome.

TITLE: Reddit, need help against my Catholic ex-roommate

POST: Reddit,
I moved in with a good friend of mine in November of last year. Before moving in with me he knew I was gay. However in February he told me that he became very religious (joined Knights of Columbus) and could no longer live with me. He asked me to 'control myself' until November at lease end or he would have to move out. 

I never had anyone over while he was at the residence and you would never know I was gay unless I told you. This all started because I had a straight friend over and the entire time he 'freaked out' thinking of what I might be doing with him. I was so furious at the time I told him to just move out.

He moved out, I could not find another roommate so we were forced to give notice to the leasing office we would be leaving. He continued to pay bills, rent, etc. 

Here is my problem, there is a $1000 dollar cancellation fee, he is to pay half and I have to pay half. I think it's ridiculous though because he is the one that broke the lease contract on his own accord based on his views, I did not want too. My attorney says the same and says the state will agree with me in small claims court. He sent my roommate a letter stating that he must pay or we will pursue civil law suit action. However no results. 

My attorney is suggesting I send him a letter basically saying 'If you are a true Catholic as you say then you will pay him the money because it's the right thing to do. He suggested I quote some excerpts from the bible. I'm not religious so I'm not too versed on what excerpts I could pull out.

She was then brought to the hospital (obviously) to be screened for all sorts of diseases and had the option of starting intense medications to prevent the microscopic chance of that needle being contaminated with HIV though the medications would make her very ill. All old navy did about the situation was lock the bathrooms so the public can't use them.

Is there anything about this situation that my mom can use in her favor? She didn't turn the syringe over to Old Navy because they were being very nonchalant and dismissive about the situation.

TITLE: Dear Reddit: Have you ever HAD to be an asshole for a moral/ good cause?

POST: I'll start, but I'm sure there are better stories out there.

I recently dated a girl, who I had high hopes for; she was quite interesting, sensual and fun. Unfortunately, she had a past/baggage that really affected her on a daily basis. In terms of social behaviour, she just wouldn't have fit in with my family or friends... In addition our long term goals were not the same. Problem was, I liked her a bunch and it was hard to come to grips and tell her how I really felt. In the end, I told her everything and was probably too straight forward, and really hurt her feelings... But I knew it had to be that way or it wouldn't be ""final""... Anyways it worked, was called a real asshole. I don't regret it, thinking it was better off this way, but still made me feel like crap.

Anyways probably more amusing stories out there than this sappy one. Let's hear it!

POST: Found out about emotional affair with ex.  Details in previous question.  He cut her off, we moved forward together.  Two months in, I found out he wasn't completely honest about how deeply this thing ran.  It's a lot of the same issues, but upon rereading what I found, I found that he was way more involved than he let on, and was leading her to believe that I was the one being unreasonable and jealous, while telling me negative things about her.   It escalated during a rough patch between us.

We talked about all those things already though.  I confronted him about that, and about everything else.  We moved forward, but this still opens an old wound and makes me question everything.  Had I known, I might have left.  I'm wondering if I should leave now.

POST: She really, really loved me. At 28, I've never had anything close to ""love"" or even infatuation for anyone, really.

I'd tried to break up with her a couple times in the past for her own good, but could never really get it to stick. It's hard to choose to hurt someone AND render yourself bored/alone and I wasn't strong enough. She finally realized recently that I really DIDN'T want to live with her or get married and all that, and we decided to split fairly amicably.

I'm really, really unbelievably bored now but I'm pretty sure I'd just put any future person in the same shitty position. Even now, there's a girl who seems interested in me and I have exactly the same lukewarm feeling about the whole thing as I did last time (or any other time in the past).  I'm tired of feeling like I'm screwing up the lives of the people who care the most about me.

I find it doubtful that some magical ""right person"" is going to come along and change all this and really have no idea what to do at this point.

TITLE: Reddit, my family is at our wits end over an issue with my apartment complex. What can I do to make everything right?

POST: We found out a couple weeks ago that our home has bed bugs, living in the master bedroom. We have had no issues before living here, and we have been here a while. After looking up some information, we saw other residents are experiencing this pest problem as well. 

We reported the problem to the complex very early on. They had a guy come out and spray for 15 minutes, when they told us he would be there for 2 hours. To prepare, they essentially made us back up our entire home and flip all the furniture,  which took a full day of our schedule. A couple days later we had no follow up from them, so I called and explained again. They said another spray has to be done, and then professional carpet cleaners will come. I'm thinking, awesome it should be fixed! 

Skip to today. The cleaners came, and now the problem is worse than ever. Their solution is to keep coming in and spraying for less than 15 minutes. 

Our bed is ruined. Our couches are ruined. We have a 5 month old child who cannot be around when they spray for a full day. And we do not have the money to buy all new furniture at this point. 

What can I do to get my life back to normal and pest free?

TITLE: Me [22F] am having crushing anxiety and guilt about if I should break up with boyfriend

POST: I've been with my boyfriend for over three years. Last week, it hit me almost overnight that I had to end things. I don't want to, but I feel like I have to. All day last Sunday my boyfriend was annoying me. He wasn't doing anything wrong, just everything he did annoyed me. When I got home it hit me that I didn't feel the same way and I literally had a panic attack. All week I have had awful anxiety about it. I can't shake this feeling that I've falle out of love with him. I don't think it is his fault, he has been fine. He doesn't abuse me or disrespect me. I think I've just come to realize that I can't make myself feel the same way about him as I used to. 

Last night when we had sex, I felt like I was having sex with a stranger. I just wanted it to be over. I feel crazy because three weeks ago I was so happy with him and was so in love, and now I have these thoughts and I don't know if it is a lapse in judgment, or if love can change and fade so quickly. The thought of ending it makes me cry and cry, leaves my heart feeling like it is on fire. Like I'm a failure for being with someone three years with nothing to show for it. I can't stop thinking about the thought of him with someone else, or the thought of him no longer in my life and it is so incredibly upsetting. I feel like I am in this limbo. Like I love him, but not enough to marry him or spend my life with him. 

On Valentine's Day we went to a hockey game and all day he was so nice, so loving. But I just kept thinking to myself that this wasn't right. Like yes he loves me, but I don't feel as in love with him as he does with me. 

Has anybody else felt like this? Did I fall out of love, or am I just out of the honeymoon stage? After my panic attack last week I went to the doctor and got on lexapro, and I just keep trying to tell myself that I'm depressed and that it isn't my boyfriend but I don't know.

TL;DR:",  Been with boyfriend for 3 years. Love him but not enough to marry him. Feel like I've fallen out of love. Should I break up with him?,  don't know if I should end things. Terrible anxiety and sadness maybe meaning I shouldn't or that I should???

POST: There was this babe who apparently is into *BATTLESTAR GALACTICA* and *FIREFLY* in my lab class this past semester who kept giving me the looks and body language that she was probably interested. We never actually spoke, because in that class I actually enjoyed the material, and was working with all the dudes on the opposite side of the room; my persona was pretty alpha because all the guys liked me and sort of looked up to me (this isn't normal), they listened when I spoke, I helped them with their work since the subject is kind of my thing, laughed at my jokes, etc.   
  
  
The class only met a total of 7-8 times, some of them she didn't show up so even fewer opportunities, but between the work, exams, scheduling, and most of all me bitching out, we never spoke to each other. It took a couple of weeks but eventually I started to forcefully forget about her.   
  
I'm taking a summer course now, and a couple of weeks ago I saw her in the hallway, we made brief eye contact, I ignored it because I was in an important meeting/conversation with faculty and stuff, but mostly again because I bitched out.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 11 months and going on a year in 2 weeks. In the beginning of our relationship, she was allowed to come over to my house, hang out, play with my siblings, and talk with my parents whenever she wanted to. However, as the relationship progressed, her parents cut her off from going to my house AT ALL without a valid reason. It's been 4 months since she has stepped foot in my house and it is really starting it irritate me. Her parents are nasty control freaks and make her text them every minute she is out of their house, even at school. I can no longer hang out with her alone and can only if she has a friend accompanying her. These new ""rules"" came out of the blue and her parents didn't even give me a reason and my girlfriend doesn't know why they did it either. She has a 4.5gpa, is the valedictorian of our school, and does many things for our community so it's not like she is this bad person. We will be going to college in less then 4 months and I want to spend as much time together as we can, but they are preventing this from happening. We already decided that we will be doing a LDR, but I don't see how it can work with how much her parents control her life.

TITLE: Two HUGE NSVs

POST: Hey /r/loseit.  I'm just checking in.  I haven't posted anything major here in about a month.  My last check in was a [100lb milestone.](

Since then, I've lost another 10 lbs.  

Last week I was featured in an ad campaign for my gym.  Full page advertisement, all week in the area (4 parish area) newspaper.

This week, my wife and I went to the mall for a haircut.  My stylist was busy, so we went and looked at jeans.

I've been wearing 36x30 Levi 501s.  The waist is quite loose now, but the legs keep getting progressively tighter (dang squats).

In order to find jeans that would accommodate my newly skinny waist, I had to find larger leg jeans.  That kinda made me sad, because I used to have to wear Levi 569, and both the legs and waist were tight.

I pulled some 34x30s off the rack and slid them on with ease.  I had quite a bit of room in them too.  I decided to try on the 32x30s, just for kicks and grins.  **They FIT!**  I had plenty of room in the waist (pulled up to my belly button), but the legs were a touch snug in both the calf and thigh (DANG SQUATS!).

As a reference.  One year ago, I got my current job.  My previous job required that I wear slacks and a tie every day.  My new job was polos and jeans.  I had 7-8 pairs of slacks, but no jeans.  A year ago this week, I went and purchased a pair of Levi 569s.  They were 46x30.

TITLE: Me [28 F] with my boyfriend [32 M] of 6 months, we hardly ever have sex and it's killing my self-esteem. Need some perspective.

POST: I'm in a fairly new relationship with a great man. He's not perfect but neither am I and for the most part I think that things are going very well. We laugh a lot together and I definitely miss him when we're apart. In a short time he's become an important part of my life that I don't want to lose. 

All that being said... the last 2 months or so we have only had sex probably 4 or 5 times. I know that for a lot of people who have been together a long time that wouldn't be unusual but for a relatively young couple who have only been together 6 months I feel like we should be doing it much more often. I am always the one who initiates and he often will huff and act like it's a chore but give in to make me happy. Last night it had been 2 weeks and we were finally about to be intimate again but he wasn't able to stay aroused. I was mortified but tried not to make a big deal about it because I didn't want him to be embarrassed either. At this point I'm really starting to think that he's just not sexually attracted to me. He's a British expat (I live in Texas) and doesn't know many people here so I'm thinking more and more that he's with me just so that he's not alone on the weekend and that he may not have sexual or romantic feelings about me at all. I can feel myself becoming more self conscious and withdrawing from him but I don't know how to stop it. If I try to speak to him about it he just rolls his eyes and tells me that I'm over analyzing everything. 

I know enough about men to logically understand that this may not be about me at all but might be about stress or something else that he's dealing with on his own but I can't help that every time he rejects me it feels like a slap in the face. A sexless relationship isn't something that I'm willing to consider long term so I want to nip this in the bud before that's what we're left with. Any advice is appreciated.

POST: Hey /relationships. My first time posting here since I really couldn't find a better place to ask a question like this. I apologize if there was a better place to post this but it seemed most appropriate in here.

Anyways, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 19 months and just moved in together last November. We are really close and have both met each other's families etc. Except for one thing, I haven't met her brother yet. From what she's told me, the two of them get into verbal and physical confrontations basically everytime they're in the same room as each other. For example, last time she was home and he was there, she was in the kitchen and her brother asked their mom ""When is that retard (my gf) getting out of the kitchen?"" He never speaks to her directly. Always makes insults indirectly at her. 

A little background about me, I am the oldest of three kids in a very tight knit family. I treat my younger brother and sister with the utmost respect. I love them so much and would never do anything intentionally to harm them or their feelings. So this behavior/relationship my gf has with her brother is completely out of the ordinary for me.

Next weekend we are going to his wedding which is taking place at their parents house. This will be my first time meeting him. I come to you to ask what is the appropriate way to handle her brother? My plan is to just treat him with respect as if I know nothing about her relationship with him. But then what if he starts making remarks about her? What do I do? It's his wedding weekend at the house he grew up in so me making a scene would be a really bad idea, right?

The first night I was in my new place I was invited out by a roommate, and so I went obviously because I'm new in a foreign city and desperately need friends. She called while I was out and so I found a quiet spot and talked to her for a bit, and since then she has been distant.

When I talked to her this morning I tried to explain that no matter where I am or who I'm with, she's completely #1 for me, but it doesn't help. She says just talking about it makes her nervous.

She has said many times that ""All the women will look at you and try to steal you"" etc., so maybe it's the sudden proximity to a lot of single girls, but really it doesn't matter if Bar Rafaeli herself approached me...

POST: We've been dating for 4 months, but we knew each other for several years prior to dating. Before my boyfriend went to work in the morning we had a quickie, but that left me wanting more. All day yesterday I had been telling him he left my craving more and that I wanted him when he got home at night.

So the night came, we were cudding on the couch and I made my advance. It should not have come as a surprise because I had been telling him I wanted him all day. I started kissing him and rubbing on him, but I could tell he sort of wasn't into it. I don't know why but I got really frustrated, I stood up and told him ""Fine, I see you don't want to play, so I am just going to leave you alone.""  I walked away for a few minutes and then I came to sit back down with him. At his point he had his head down and started crying. I felt really bad!

I apologized and we talked. He has told me he is trying to take it slow because in his past relationships he always had a lot of sex and they ended up breaking his heart. He is somehow associating that if he has a lot of sex then the relationship will go sour. He has assured me he wants things to work out for the long haul and is serious about our relationship, I'm just trying to figure out this part.

Anytime he approaches me when he is horny I am glad to satisfy him, but when I approached him last night I felt rebuffed.

Did I overract? Should I try not approching him for a little while, like giving sex a break for a few days? 

He is a very sensitive guy, and I know that already. I want to be considerate of his feelings. Yet at the same time I want him to understand my needs as well.

TITLE: Dealing with a frenemy who just. won't. go. away.

POST: I'm in graduate school, and over the past several years, I've had what I would call a 'frenemy'. This girl has been hot and cold with me for as long as we've had classes together - sometimes she would invite me to spend time with her and her friends, and then completely stop talking to me, claiming that she's busy (which, as I've come to learn, 'busy' is 99% of the time a cover). She says a lot of nasty things about people, and then turns around and spends time with them. 

This past year was really hard for me due to personal issues, and while she and I were never that close, we became closer. She became supportive and would listen to me. I thought maybe she had grown, and I started to trust her.

That all changed when one of her male friends (that she has a thing for) told her he was interested in me - and he and I never met. She completely stopped talking to me, and the only reason I know this is because of a mutual friend.

I asked her in general if things were ok and how she was doing, and she said everything was good - so she wouldn't address this with me directly. I didn't want to directly say that I knew what her problem was, because I figured at this point, she should just be able to tell me what was up. 

Months later, out of the blue, she texts me and says that she's been really busy and not to take it personally that she hasn't been around. I said that I do take it personally, and then she responded back with how she doesn't have the energy to deal with me because she's so 'busy'. 

I'm SO done with her, and I've totally disconnected from her, as I find this response to be seriously rude and dishonest.

TITLE: I [F/23] have had only 1 relationship and don't know what to do relationship and sex wise with date [M/25]

POST: I'll try to make this short(ish).
So I have had only one committed relationship in my life; my high school AND college sweetheart. We were together for eight years. He is the guy I lost my virginity to and the only boyfriend I have ever had. However, we broke up this January. I am completely over it now. Haven't really dated since, just some coffees and lunch dates. Decided to get off the pill because it was terrible for my mood, libido and was causing some physical complaints. Haven't had sex since January, fine with me.

But now I started dating this guy and I really like him. It's actually scary to admit because I have only experienced this beginning phase of love ONCE: almost nine freaking years ago. We have been on three dates, kissed and I hope to call him my boyfriend in the future.

However this shit is frightening me. I thought I was super experienced due to my eight year relationship but turns out I know nothing. It's been three dates and we haven't had sex. My girlfriends are telling me I am weird en prude for not having sex yet and that he'll probably won't want a fourth or fifth date. It's not even the sex itself that I am concerned about, it's the damn pill. I don't want to rely on solely a condom, but I only got off the pill three months ago and my period still isn't perfectly regular. I just don't want to fuck up my body again but maybe I should to keep him happy?

Also, when do you start thinking about being boyfriend-girlfriend? It's only been three dates over a course of 1,5 month, is that extremely short? Long? Normal?

Basically I am a giant noob and need advice.

TL;DR:","  Only had one relationship in my life, it ended in January. Started dating someone new but haven't had sex yet. Don't know how to proceed and am worried about messing up my body again.","  had only one long relationship, don't know what to do with sex and being exclusive after 3 dates.

TITLE: So I just asked my girlfriend [21] to tie up loose ends with her ex. I [24] need opinions if I did the right thing.

POST: Hear me out here.

A few days ago my girlfriend and I were having a heart-to-heart talk and we suddenly got to the topic of relationships.  I got uneasy when she started talking about her past relationships, but she was fine with talking about it so casually so I was like, why not.

There is this one guy she keeps mentioning though. It was her ex before me. Her longest relationship too, albeit being an on-and-off thing for 2 years. She told me a LOT about this guy, how they were doing, why they broke up, how they went back again, broke up and went out again..the usual on-off jazz. And then it ended for good because it just didn't work for her, and that was that.

Here's the thing though: she told me they talk occasionally online. Usual chit-chat I guess? She told me she treats him as a friend, that it's not every day or week they talk. About a month or two before he resurfaces and talks again.

Then it bit me: what if the guy wasn't over her yet? I talked to her about it and she told me she doesn't like talking to the guy except she feels obligated to do so because, you know, friends right?

I felt horrible though. Why would he? I mean, I know people check how their exes are doing every now and then, stalking I guess but never talking, but when they want to talk..should I be worried? So I asked her to tell the guy off. Like, close it completely and move on and not talk to her any more.

I was just wondering: I've never asked her anything that..important, I guess..to not talk to another person. It eats me away inside, but was it right for me to ask her to do that?

TL;DR:",  Asked my girlfriend to tell off her ex who resurfaces and talks to him occasionally via online communication. Was it right for me to ask her to do that?,  I asked my girlfriend to tell her ex to move on since she's got me now and to stop talking to her. But I feel horrible. Was it right for me to ask her that? WHAT I DO.

POST: We've been dating for 4.5 years. For the first 3 years things were great, we'd see each other during the week or on the weekends and we never had any issues, maybe had 1 or 2 fights the whole time. 

Last year we moved in together and since then sex has dwindled down to nothing... Over christmas we moved back to our folks place until we found another place to live, and have been living together since April. 

Slowly sex has started to die off. Since about 2 years ago she's had on and off problems with UTIs/thrush and now we haven't had sex (or anything) in over a month. She now feels that she can't be bothered with sex as it sometimes leads to her in pain and hurting. We recently had a talk and she's said that she just isn't a very sexual person (not the impression I had from the first 3 years together). I know she owns 2 vibrators (one she keeps hidden in a drawer in a different room) and I know they get use.

I can't help but feel depressed about this. She says she's not sexual but it just seems to me that she is, but just not involving me. Sex, or any physical affection, is fairly important in a relationship to me, but neither seem to be to her. What do I do...? What can be done...?

POST: Just to be clear, I'm not clingy, I don't care if I don't text someone for days, I'm just trying to figure if we are on the same page or not. I like her, a lot. It's been 7 years for me since my last real relationship and this is the first time in that 7 years that I've felt this way about a girl. 

If it isn't clear by now, I over-analyze *everything*. If you want the honest truth, going 7 years without feeling this way for a girl will make you do some crazy things, hence this post. Even if it's bad news, I just need to ease my mind because not knowing is stressing me the fuck out. 

I realize I probably sound crazy and too emotionally invested, but like I said, this doesn't happen often, and I just wish I could know if the feelings are mutual, because at this point I'm kind of assuming the worst (bad habit).

I cannot stress enough that I don't care that she hasn't texted me back, people have lives, etc etc, I get it. but it just kinda worries me that it's a bad sign and I'm curious if the females reading this think not responding to a text for over 24 hours now is probably nothing, probably means something not-so-good, etc. 

If I'm being fucking retarded and you think 24 hours is no big deal and you think she could still be really into me then just say so, you aren't gonna hurt my feelings.

Basically need some kind of reassurance either way, because 7 years without this is a long time and this is stressing me the fuck out, lol.

Thank you for tolerating my shenanigans.

TITLE: My husband 42M with his daughter 18F, conflict over attending high school graduation

POST: My husband and his ex had a very contentious divorce and it took them 10 years after the divorce to get to the point where they were being polite and reasonable with each other. 

My stepdaughter lives with her Mom in a different state and visits us multiple times a year, per the visitation agreement. My husband and his daughter don't have the best relationship but they do love each other and get along well, or so I thought. 

We were planning on driving down to stepdaughter's city and attending her graduation, so she'd have her father, step mom and half siblings cheering her on in addition to her Mom and stepdad. DH has been asking her about graduation details many times so we could plan our trip, but she kept avoiding him. Though she didn't say anything, eventually he got the message that she didn't want him there. I have been encouraging DH that we should still go and attend since the ceremony doesn't require tickets. 

The graduation is in 4 days and DH got invited by his ex to attend. I think that's a big gesture from her part because she is usually pretty rude to DH. While it was nice of her to invite him, she made it clear that I or our kids (stepdaughter's half siblings) are not welcome. DH tried reaching out to his daughter to ask what she wanted and she's simply avoiding him. 

DH has decided he's not going to go to the graduation. I worry that he's going to regret this. I am pushing him to go by himself, attend the event, take pictures and fly back. While I am pretty upset that I am not wanted there, I think it's more important that DH not miss this milestone. 

Am I wrong in trying to convince him to do this? How big a loss will it be if he skips this graduation?

TL;DR:","  Husband's ex invited him to attend her daughter's graduation, daughter made it clear that I or our stepkids are not welcome. Husband is not going to go.

TITLE: Should I go for it even though my time is running out?

POST: So basically there's this girl in my class whom I'm attracted to and I think that there is a chance that we could end up being a couple, but there seems to be a few things that can prevent that from happening. 

1. I've heard rumors that she is in an arranged marriage (Her family is Middle Eastern; Haven't confirmed this from her, as she is private and most likely wouldn't want to say anything on the matter)

2. We have a few months left before she goes back home for a couple months and then will be going off to college (I'm only a Junior), and I most likely won't see her ever again unless we end up going to the same college 2 years from now, which does seem likely as we plan on going to the same school. 

3. It seems that she's been hurt by a previous guy from what she has told me, and she's told me she hates most guys at our school. 
My question is: Should I try to start a relationship with her? A lot of people might say hell yeah live life to the fullest and all, which I totally want to do. I just don't know if she feels the same and I'm also looking for a serious relationship, and a few months isn't enough time to do as such. Thanks for reading! :)

TITLE: Waiting is the hardest part.

POST: Dear Reddit,I am kinda confused on what to do here so I am seeking your advice. (this is a long one by the way)

There is a girl who I like very much and still have deep feelings for. We had been dating for a year and four days when we broke up/went on a break as I needed to figure somethings out with myself and needed to take a breather from the relationship. 

We remained close friends (Still are to best of my knowledge)and on three seperate occasions had sex while not technically being together. Fast forward to the current time, I have recently (A week ago) told this girl that I am ready to be in a relationship with her again and still care very deeply for her. 

Her reply was that ""I am currently in a relationship""and then soon added but he leaves for Hong Kong in two weeks for 9 months. I then enquired if it was possible that we could be together at somepoint in the future.She replied that""Anything is possible and you never know what the future holds"" 

Now that being said I still love her very much and am currently waiting for the guy she is seeing to leave the country.I feel that after this happens I will be in a better situation as her friend to win her back.

Now a little about this girl,she can't really deal with seperation and as Hong Kong has a 12 hour time difference and her re-bound is going to be busy with work and developing a social network out there and well won't have that much time for her as a whole. 

I am hoping that due to this she won't be  able to handle being in a relationship with this guy and perhaps comes back to me. I know it is a lot to hope for but at the moment I am biding my time awaiting for this guy to leave. 

Well Reddit I ask you what would you do in my situation,would you wait as you said you would and waitfor the re-bound guy to leave, before talking to her again and take it as friends (Like I am currently doing) or would you do something else. 

Thanks.

TL;DR:","  Still have feelings for ex-GF,she is seeing someone else now and I am waiting for the guy to leave the country before I try to re-bound with her again.

TITLE: TIFU by being lazy and gettin my 290x urinated on

POST: So this story started a week ago and concluded today. I live in a house, and my neighbours are 1 abbandoned house(some lady emigrated to Canada) and the other one is still a construction site, and its being like this for atleast 2 years since i moved in. That means there are lot of mice  nesting in those 2  buildings. Being winter those little buggers always try to get in my house via the open door. Usually they are murdered by my trustworthy cocker spaniel but somehow this one kept escaping her  for about a week. My wife started nagging me to get some traps and get the motherfucker, but i always said that i have faith in the dog. 

  Today after i came from work, while my wife was cooking dinner i was browsing the inernets, suddenly  my monitors black out, and the fan from my video card goes full throttle. I have a 290x reference so  the fan goes real loud like 2 vacuum cleaners and 2 hair dryers all on max speed kinda like this  . I power down the pc remove the panel and check the video card. I switch the bios from UBER mode to normal and power the pc again trying to determine if it was a bios issue. The fan goes again 100% and a mouse jumps from unused hdd bays. I power the pc down, remove the video card and see some mouse piss on it. 

  The little fucker literally pissed on my card. I took the isopropyl alcohol and  washed the back of the card real good the used a hair dryer on it for about 3 mins. Plugged in and it freaking worked!! Meanwhile the little fucker was laying dead in the middle of my living room with my dog wagging her tail proudly.When he jumped from my pc case he jumped right in front of my dog and got what it deserved by pissing on my precious. Also found out that he got inside the case by entering in the slot where i had a tv-tuner which i removed and forgot to put the back plate.

POST: I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years now. We met online and had instant chemistry. We had a rocky start because he is very progressive and I am extremely old fashioned. The first time he told me he loved me was, I think, more of a cover up for the fact that he also revealed he'd gotten a girl pregnant just before dating me. He told her he didn't want anything to do with it and that I was his priority. Probably my first indication to run. 

Later I found he had been talking to ex's back in his hometown(very far away from where we are) and I wanted to call it quits at that point. I decided not to because I had already fallen in love with him and trusted him when he said he's change. 

Don't get me wrong, he makes me ecstatically happy, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed. We talk about marriage and children a lot. Now we have picked up our lives and moved together to an entirely new city so that we both could have better jobs, but I think I need a fresh start and probably a break from men who do not know what it means to be exclusive. Also I find he texts women from work more often than he should. He has a lot of female interaction on his job and I don't trust him with it. This is what sparked my post.

At work he brags about how great he is at social media. Here is the kicker, I was recently let go because I think he wants his company to do my work and he used his ""credentials"" to make an impression that they are great at what they do.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my girlfriend [19F]: How long should we stay together?

POST: Basically I would just like to get the general opinion of everyone here on the forum.

I met my girlfriend around 2 years ago our first year in college. Within a year after that, we really hit it off and we've been dating ever since. We celebrated our one-year anniversary last month.

We haven't explicitly talked about this because she's been abroad this semester, and I haven't felt the need to bring it up amidst all the stress she's going through. But I wanted to ask everyone here what my best course of action would be.

Basically I think my girlfriend and I know that we're going to break up at some point - probably after graduation. We make each other really happy, we get along well, and we have a great time together. The sex is great too, and we've been in love a long time.

We basically started dating for the fun of it: we liked each other, and we've only grown to love each other more and more. The problem is, our long-term goals don't mesh. 

She doesn't want to pursue academics immediately after graduation. I do. That will inevitably create some distance. Also, she's told me many times that she doesn't want to have kids. I do want to have kids. Finally, our religious and philosophical views don't exactly line up.

So what do you guys think I should do? Right now, I think we're both assuming we'll be together until graduation. We can't really see ourselves with anyone else at the moment. And to be honest I don't think I'm going to find my life partner at my school if it isn't her.

POST: Hi, /r/relationships.

I had a falling out with a friend and business partner, call him John, who I've known for almost a decade. He was controlling, condescending, manipulative, and unfair. When I told him that I didn't appreciate the fact that he naturally assumed a position of power and belittled me, he didn't respond saying that he didn't do those things. Instead, he threw a temper tantrum and asked me why things ought to be fair. I disappeared shortly after. I did nothing wrong to him, I just didn't care to play his games any longer and decided to finally stick up for myself and part ways. I have nothing but contempt for this sorry excuse of a human being.

We have a lot of the same friends. On one occasion, I asked a friend if I could play a gig. He contacted John behind my back, he told him ""I wouldn't work with Red Cloak,"" and I never heard from that friend again. I know this because John told me. He has also spoken to managers about me which has affected my employment and cost me money.

Just recently, I was talking to a girl [27 F]. We were communicating for a couple of weeks (she lives out of town). She's good friends with John but didn't know we had a falling out. One day, everything about her changed. She brought texting to a halt, stopped returning my calls, and acted very detached. I asked her why and she gave me the whole ""I've just been busy"" routine. I have good reason to believe that she asked John about me, because they still talk/hang out, and he told her to stay away from me. 

I don't know what to do about him. I'm not going to apologize for ditching someone who was doing me a great deal of psychological damage. I thought it would be over but I guess he's still looking for blood. What can I do? My anger is tearing me apart.

I've been a relationship with my girlfriend for just over 10 months, Im from England [m21], and shes from america, we met up at a summer camp and hit it off well. All was fine we visited each other often when we could,

(They've been friends for a few years in school Im sure he did have a crush on her at one point)

The message said ""I might be going to prom with matt now"" which to me says I'm going with this one person as a date. I told her I didn't like it but she said that it was more of he's just joining her and her group of friends for the night and he would only come if he got to say he was going with her.

Prom night comes and goes all is ok , until the next day when I start seeing pictures, first its of them stood near each other which hurt but I passed it off as ok. 

I started talking to her about the photo's and how there were non of them together in a couple like shot and she said ""yeah no way i wouldn't do that"" ... well she did and now I'm really mad and not sure how to confront her.
She did offer to not go with him but since she stated it wasn't a date or she was even going with and it was simply him joining her friend circle I told her no as I didn't want to come off as controlling.

POST: So a couple of weeks ago I received a notice in the mail from GM stating that my 2006 Pontiac G6 needed to be taken to a dealership for services pertaining to recalls. Nothing was seemingly wrong with my vehicle, but obviously I took it to my closest GM dealership to get the appropriate services taken care of. One of the recalls dictated that the transmission cable required replacement. Within the next week of getting my car serviced, my transmission stopped working. (The vehicle worked perfectly fine in reverse, but not in drive.) So I have it towed to the same dealership to have it looked at. Im not saying I am absolutely positive this dealership screwed up their work on my transmission, but it would be a huge coincidence if they didn't, right? They take a day and a half to get back in contact with my wife after diagnosing the problem. What is the diagnosis you ask? ""Your transmission isn't working."" Then they tell my wife that it takes 14 hours to take apart a transmission and figure out exactly what the problem is at $100.00 an hour for labor. Plus $3500.00 for a new transmission. But my wife doesn't think to bring up that it was very likely their fault during this conversation. (She was at work and told them to contact me once they were finished with the diagnosis anyway.) And the dealership sure as shit didn't acknowledge that it may be their fault. So, my question is, how do I proceed when I show up at the dealership at 8 A.M. tomorrow?

TITLE: (24/F) I hate losing arguments to my bf (27/m)

POST: I just got into another heated petty argument with my bf of 3 years! He started telling our roommate a story about someone, I was sure he was thinking of something else, he stops dead in his tracks and tells me that that's not what happened. I said more details of what I remembered, he told me again that I was wrong and I should believe him because it's a story that happened to him. He said what he always does, ""why is it that when we disagree you assume I must be wrong? Why don't you ever consider that you could be wrong?"" 

By that point I had realized it was possible I was wrong, but I absolutely did not want to concede that to him or offer him any slack. I don't get like this with everybody, but my bf and I both have this stupid trait of never backing down! And I hate admitting I'm wrong to him because I feel like he acts super smug and condescending, when I make a mistake he laughs at me in an ""oh, you"" sort of way that INFURIATES me. I know I overreact to this sort of thing but I don't know how to improve!

TITLE: 20[M]. Cute girl in class. Not sure how to approach.

POST: There is a really cute girl in one of my classes that I'd really like to ask out. There are a few problems though. I have a really good female friend in the class and we talk a lot and I always walk with her to her next class or whatever and she's completely unchill so if I tell her what's up (don't wait up I'm about to ask this girl out) she'll totally blow it. Also the one day I struck up the nerve to talk to her I discovered that every lecture when it's over she makes a beeline for the exit and disappears like a god damn ninja. All of the above are also, while true, excuses for the fact that I've never asked someone out cold before. I don't know how people can just walk up to someone they know nothing about except their name (or sometimes not even their name) and be like ""hey, let's go get lunch?"" The only way I've ever done this before is to just make small talk with them about something interesting in the class or something on their person and then at the end of the conversation see if they want to do something. I'd say that I should just take something from class that was interesting and say ""what do you think about X"" but it's like the most boring god damn class ever (professional writing).

TITLE: Can we stop with the wedding showers and start with the life showers?

POST: So the whole point in wedding shower is to come together as a community and help a couple start their lives together. My question is why do we have to wait until we are getting married? My best guess is people (especially women) didn't start their own lives before marriage. But the world has changed! I've graduated college, am living on my own, and working. Life has already started for me. It would be really nice to have my friends and family help me to establish a nice place for myself. I am doing it on my own, and there is a lot of satisfaction in the independence of it. Still, it seems kind of unfair to have to wait until engagement for community support. Reddit parents who have a son or daughter who is becoming or recently financially independent, tell your friends and family to skip the wedding shower and throw them a life shower.

For the last 2 years, my wife (28/F) has developed anxiety issues and also perceives our marriage as more of a friendship than lovers.  We have sex maybe once every 2 months, and even then, its not a good time.  Its like she feels like she's having to do it to make me happy and I just want her to want to have sex with me.  We get along in every day life and we hang out and whatnot, but intimacy has dwindled to almost zero.  She has pretty much checked out, sexually and has no desire to make things better in the bedroom.  I do not want to cheat on my wife, but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Im incredibly horny every day, I dont want masturbate every day so I can function, and I really yearn to be intimate with a woman.  Like even kissing and making out and making love would be awesome.  What else is difficult is that I'm a fairly good-looking guy so getting women is not a problem.  I really just want to have sex with my wife, even 3 times a week would be great.  But she wants nothing to do with me and I've resorted to just watching porn and jerking off every day so I'm not an angry bear.  I really hate the state of our marriage and intimacy and want no one else other than my wife, but she literally has no sex drive and I dont want to feel like I'm making her do anything she doesn't want to do.  I kind of feel like she's not really contributing to this marriage, but I'd be an asshole if I went out and sought intimacy from another woman.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks

POST: I have known my boyfriend for about 8 years, we have been together for 3. He has been smoking from about age 15.

Even before we were together he has said that he want's to quit smoking. He has been doing this thing where he says he will quit tomorrow, or that he he has to finish the pack and then he will quit or similar. He says that at least once a week. Then he won't really try. He will get new cigarettes that same evening.

TITLE: My unconfrontational self [22 F] confronting my noisy upstairs neighbor [20ish M/F] who plays the drums.

POST: This is not the traditional relationship, if there's a better place to post this, educate me.

First, let me describe my relevant living situation. I live in student-style housing in the Netherlands. My room is located in a corridor that is locked by key on either side, which is relevant.

So, the issue:

The past couple of weeks, my upstairs neighbor has taken up drumming. Whether it is drumming on actual drums, tapping his desk, or an equivalent, I have no idea. I can, however, hear it. Is it in my right to do anything about this? They're in their own space, it is not an ungodly hour, but I don't want to be subjected to this! I am not a confrontational person, calm or otherwise. Things I have tried to send a message to my upstairs neighbor that their drumming is undesired:

* Hitting my ceiling with a broom 
* Hitting my ceiling with my palm
* Hitting my ceiling with a water bottle
* Hitting my ceiling with a can of sausages

Unfortunately, my revolutionary tactics have failed. This could be due a lack of fucks given, they're dumb shits who can't take a hint, or they can't hear my attempts to save my sanity. It has crossed my mind to go knock on their door, which scares the living shit out of me anyways. However, I can not. The only way I could go knock on their door is to get through their locked corridor door or ring their door bell. BUT, I don't know their room number. It a terribly designed building, so the numbers are not consistent from corridor to corridor.

So, c'mon reddit! Let's hear those creative ideas. How do I get my neighbor to shut the fuck up?

TL;DR:",  My noisy upstairs neighbor drumming. I can hear it. I have tried everything I can think of to tell him to stop. Nothing works. How do I get him to shut the fuck up?,  My upstairs neighbor drums. I can hear it. I don't want to hear it. I am not confrontational. Canned sausages are not working.

TITLE: My [26F] bf's [27M] best friend [27M] is selfish and takes advantage of him and doesn't appreciate anything we do.

POST: My boyfriend's best friend of over 10 years is a selfish, center of attention type person. He always needs to be in the spotlight and leeches off of my boyfriend and I. My bf doesn't have a job while he does. He asks for rides to the gym, when we're going for lunch, dinner, rock climbing, etc, uses my bf's netflix account (and asks us to get off when netflix doesn't let him on so he can watch a show with a girl he is currently dating at the time). My bf would lend his bed to him for a night and his friend would have sex in it with his gf (at the time). He complains about how expensive rent/gas is for him yet goes to bars, takes girls out on dinner dates, etc. and it comes across as it justifies him to leech from us.

It was his birthday a couple of months ago and we were moving out the next day. We still weren't fully packed for the next morning, but all he wanted to do is hang out with my bf. He came over for dinner (which we made), talked about the girls he was dating and didn't care for things I had to say. He rushed my boyfriend to pack a couple of things then they left to go back to his place while I stayed behind to pack up the rest of the night. We still weren't ready for the next morning. He really should've just come by and helped us pack since my bf helped him unpack when he moved.

Of all the things that I have done for him, he has never tried to return the favour or done anything to show how appreciative he is. He's that guy who comes by, steals your wifi, your food, your netflix, and peaces out once he gets what he has because he doesn't want to spend a dime himself.

I really don't know how to express this to my bf, especially since he says he doesn't mind his friend's behavior. I don't need my bf to stop seeing his best friend, but maybe try to influence him to treat people better.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriends best friend is selfish and takes advantage of him and doesn't appreciate anything we do. How can I express to my bf that he should stop seeing his best friend and try to change his behavior?,  Bf's friend is a leech and doesn't care about anyone else but himself. It's causing a dilemma for me because it's his best friend.

TITLE: Race Report: First Marathon!

POST: Hey /R/unnit,

Just wanted to follow up and post a race report for the Yellowknife Overlander Marathon (which was my first ever marathon) that I finished today!

After running my first half 6 weeks ago and getting 3 weeks of training before my taper I was woefully underprepared but I set out only to finish. My final time was 4 hours and 20 something minutes, I sadly was so caught up in the moment that I didn't take a look at the clock but I will get my results in the next week.

I woke up at 5 AM today and had my usual long run breakfast of a bagel + energy drink. The weather was between 10-20 celsius, gradually warming up as the time ticked on, but very bearable with the overcast and wind. 

Miles 1-13: Fairly uneventful and basically was just warming up at a 10 minute pace or slower, minor irritants like my foot getting a pinch on every step (nothing painful I could just feel it) and my stomach being grumbly.

MIles 13-20: At this point I was starting to feel a bit of fatigue as the miles started to pile on. Around mile 13.5 I got a major cramp in my foot and I had to retie my shoe way tighter which alleviated the issue for the most part. At mile 16 I had to use the washroom really bad and was lucky to snag a toilet out on the route (these were spread out very few and far between) which saved my ass when I felt I was going to burst.

20-24: At this point I felt I had good energy but the wear and tear on my muscles was reaching new levels. Hips, my left knee, my feet, my nips, hamstring were all seizing up and it was some of the most mentally challenging parts of the race.  

24-26: Flat ground and smooth sailing, I was sort of hobbling to make it back but I never walked once! 

post 26: I am in bed and everything hurts, theres nothing that isn't aching and I want ice cream...

TL;DR:","  First marathon, first time running, first time finishing, first time feeling so drained and mentally exhausted. I finished today and I am so happy with how it went!","  Woefully underprepared for a race, worked my ass off and finished in a better time than I had expected, feel great (except my entire body is aching) and I am totally doing a second."

TITLE: Me [26/F], question about wedding expenses after death of mom[64/F]. Sister [30/f] is getting married soon and we don't know what is asking too much of my Dad

POST: Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. First time posting on reddit at all actually. I'm posting on my sister's behalf really because she doesn't really get this site. 

Long story short, my sister and I have a wonderful relationship with our parents. Very healthy, very loving. Unfortunately, my mom passed away very suddenly a couple of months ago which has hit my family really hard. Not to get into it, it was very unexpected and completely devastating.  My parents were married for 43 years, and were such a role model for my sister and I. My dad is struggling, we all are, but we try and support each other. 

My sister has recently become engaged...she and her fiance are both employed. He is making pretty good money and my sister is doing okay. Not terrible. 

Anyway, my parents had retired and were living pretty well off of their pensions. I know they have investments, but I don't know the extent. I obviously didn't really inquire too much about their business.  With the death of my mom, my sister and I worry about my Dad's finances. My mom's retirement and pension was a lot more than my dad's, so we know he took a hit financially. My Dad is a wonderful man, and would pay for the whole thing if he could, but my sister is anxious about asking too much of him. She's stuck because she knows if she doesn't let him pay for anything it'll hurt his feelings but she also doesn't want him paying for too much. 

I guess we're just not sure how to approach this. What is normal for parents of the bride to pay for? I was thinking he could help with the venue and her dress but I have no idea. And how do we let him help but not let him give too much?? I'm the maid of honor for my sister, and I'm trying to plan with her, but I'm completely at a loss and any input would be greatly appreciated. I don't know if I gave enough info, I'm pretty scattered. If you have questions I'll be happy to answer.

TITLE: I [20F] am invited to Thanksgiving dinner after my parents disowned me over a year ago.

POST: This is a terribly long story, so I'll try to shorten it and will add follow-up information if needed.

To start, my parents disowned me at 18 due to religious reasons and the fact that they didn't like my boyfriend (this is the part of the story I'm shortening). They told me to go pack my things, neither me or my boyfriend were ever allowed there, and that I wouldn't be able to talk to my younger siblings until they were 18. At the time my sister was 16 and little brother was 13. 

I have since seen my younger siblings a few times, but only while my older sister and/or mother was there. I've emailed my mother a few times and though things aren't peachy, they are certainly better than they once were. If it weren't for my siblings though, I wouldn't speak to her at all. 

Her and (more so) my father have been emotionally and verbally abuse to me and the rest of my siblings for as long as I can remember. I no longer have a desire to fix the relationship I have with them, because I have tried many times and it's at the point where I have to stop subjecting myself to the hurt they spread. 

I got an email from my mother yesterday asking if I wanted to come to Thanksgiving dinner and I have no idea if I should go. I want to go for my younger siblings, because I love them and love when I do get to see them. However, I don't want my parents to think they are allowed to pretend like nothing has happened and that they've been good parents (they still refuse that they've ever been anything but good parents or see how they've done anything wrong). I also don't want to give them the wrong idea that there's a salvageable relationship between us. 

Should I go? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR:","  Parents disowned me over a year ago, have since seen my younger siblings a few times but only when my older sister or mother was there. Should I go to Thanksgiving dinner with them?",  My parents who disowned me want me to come to Thanksgiving dinner. Not sure if I should go or not.

TITLE: Reddit, is finance a pseudoscience?

POST: Through my studies (bachelors), I have become more and more disturbed about the ""scientific"" nature of finance. 

Quick, what percentage of mutual funds ""beat the market"", i.e. perform better than the index? Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial ""knowledge"" seems to do more harm than good.

When looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.

How about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.

Even option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. 

Wanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.

TL;DR:",  Is finance a pseudoscience? Studies show that financial models are often flawed and rely on assumptions that are often wrong. Is finance a pseudoscience?,  Financial theories need supernatural clairvoyance and are based on arbitrary assumptions that ignore real world and data. Monkeys throwing darts at random perform better than financial experts when it comes to stocks.

TITLE: Need help with adopted cat.

POST: Hey everyone, I recently adopted a cat (about two weeks ago now) She's a 4 year old and is TINY. We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell? Her history at the shelter says they found her as a new appearance in a Feral colony, so they thought she was a stray. I don't think she's feral because she lets you touch her (not pick her up; and bring your face even close to her is a nono...) She also hasn't tried to escape the house...or leave the bathroom at all (except one night when she tugged my electric shaver down and it caused her to run laps around the house.

(Probably, I assumed.) My CC and the local 4 year are pretty buddy-buddy and have credit transfer deals and generally help its local students out. But while they have a general psychology bachelor's program, they only have master's and PhDs in counseling. Also, I hear that you can go directly from a bachelor's into a doctorate program, if you have the GPA, undergrad research or enough experience, and good GRE scores. (I like this idea because I'm a relatively poor student and rely heavily on financial aid and small loans.) I'm also wondering about internships and the stipends that come with some of them? Is that just for doctorate programs? I would prefer to baby step it from a masters to a doctorate, I don't want to do anything I'm not 100% ready for.

I need your honest advice how to act to not destroy this. Here are some more details.

Few weeks ago I met this girl at a party and we talked a lot and I had a great time with her, so I asked for her number and got it. After that we started to text each other a lot and I asked her out to the movies and it was basically great but nothing serious happened.

No Kiss - just a hug.

tbh I haven't done a right approach since I kinda got shy somehow. It's weird because normally I'm the complete opposite.

The next time we met she invited me to her place and we watched a movie together. Things got more ""touchy"" - we cuddled and were more playful but her family (including younger siblings that disturbed us) was at home so a kiss on her cheek was the limit.

Now here comes the part where I need your help. I know I like her very much and haven't felt this way for a long time but I don't know if she feels the same for me.

I will meet her this Sunday at a quit romantic Christmas market. What is your advice to get this flirt-thingy to the real dating and how can I really ask her how she feels for me?

TL;DR:",  After a bad break up I met a girl and we hit it off but nothing serious happened. I need your advice on how to act to not destroy this relationship.,  Please give me advice how to get this flirt-thing to real dating with the girl I've been seeing for a while.

POST: My longdistance relationship of 1 year ended today. We live 2 hours away from each other and we dont talk on the phone, so I texted her and explained why I couldn't take it any longer and that it was over. We're two different persons with different interests and views, so naturally it just doesn't work out, and I want out. So I plain out told her, and now she refuses to accept it. She says that she is willing to work it out and that we can get together, and to which I respond that it really isn't her decision and if I don't want to be together we're not together. You cant have a relationship where only 1 person really wants it. As simple as that. So what do I do? What do I tell her?

TITLE: Help! Photography dilemma!

POST: Sorry for the wall of text......

My fiance and I are on a budget.  The most we can spend on photography is $1,500, but our main concern is just to get good ceremony shots and a few good shots to hang on our wall.

I found one photographer in our area that is pretty new to the biz.  He and his assistant will do an engagement shoot and an entire wedding day of photos for $1,200 (getting ready - cake cutting). We like his photographs, they would be good and acceptable. I have been talking to him, and think we would get along pretty well.

My sister recommended a different photographer, a woman she had previously worked with.  Her photos are AMAZING, and have recently been featured in style me pretty and other such blogs.  Her normal package is $2,900 for an engagement shoot, herself & an assistant, all day photos, and 200 4x6 prints.  I've been talking to her today (she's doing a $500 off cyber Monday deal), and she could get it down to $1,500 - this would cut out the second shooter and the prints. 

I'd jump on the second photographer immediately, but my fiance seems to be excited at the thought of having getting ready photos (he originally didn't care, but after thinking he COULD have it, he started to like it).  I'm also not sure if not having a second photographer would be a big mistake!

TITLE: Is my friend [20/f] a cleptomaniac?

POST: I [23/f] have known here for quite a while and this is something particularly that I dislike about her. She is really dear to me but knowing these parts makes me feel unpleasant in her surroundings. Whenever she travells, she comes back with bunch of stuff such as shirts, earrings, bracelets, shorts and all the stuff you could put in your bag. The other day she asked me if I wanted to go with her in chinese shopping mall and steal stuff for summer, I said yes just to avoid further asking because I needed to think about it. I never really stole anything and that is not what my parents taught me. I just dont support it at all, especially if its material stuff that im stealing. If I have to steal one necklace, I don't even need it at all, it would always remind me of the bad ''small krime'' i did. However, today she came back from short trip with her friends in nearby village, with a really nice necklace and I asked her where did she find it since it really looks appealing to me and also, my style. She said, with such a nonchalance, that she stole it in an open-air store. That was the moment where I thought ''Why do you keep doing it''.

She comes from pretty nice and harmonic family, she is a student and we all live in a students dorm. Her parents send her enough money for food and I guess she could always ask them for more money.

Do you, dear redditors, consider her a cleptomaniac? What are the causes?

She loved me , I loved her, we broke up for good about 2 months ago, I started seeing a new girl and have had sex with her, she is pretty, but opposite of my ex, where as my ex is Asian, my new SO is strong italian blooded.

Everything I do with my SO I mentally compare to my ex, the hugs, the kisses, the hand holding, and the sex, both girls are vastly diffrent down there, my ex having larger lips, where as my new SO is much tighter.

It is just killing me, because I shouldnt be mentally comparing anyone to my ex. And I just dont know how to stop it?

TITLE: Me [18m] and my girlfriend [17f] are looking at the same college, could we stay together?

POST: I know lots of people will the title and think I'm considering continuing our relationship after high school, into college. This isn't entirely true however. Here are the details. 

One of the colleges on my list is a fairly close but competitive state school. I have already applied and expect to be accepted under automatic acceptance rules. She went on a day visit recently with a close friend, and stated she likes the campus a lot. However, she is paying for her college herself, so her plan is to attend community college for a year as a cheaper way to complete some prerequisites.

While I absolutely love being with her, and couldn't be happier with our relationship, as seniors I expect the worse come graduation, when we go our separate ways. I have heard that it is a drag socially to freshman who try to hang on to their significant others at different schools. But suppose the two in the relationship both end up choosing the same school, for reasons outside of the relationship, would it be feasible to try to stay together? I know this is far down the road, a lot could happen in between now and then, and like I said she would be at community college for a year and I wouldn't see her for that time. But I'm curious to know if anybody has succeeded in this.

TITLE: Me [21/F] having a hard time maintaining friendships. I think I forgot how to have friends?

POST: Hi r/relationships! 

I am a 21 year old female and ever since leaving high school, I feel like it has become impossible for me to keep friendships. Up until age 16/17 I was generally liked in school and had a few extremely close friends. I was loud, childish and loving life. Unfortunately I developed mental issues (I'm bipolar) and scared/pushed most of them away for many different reasons. After getting treatment and leaving for university (age 19) I decided to have a fresh start. New city, new friends right? But since then, I struggle.

I do have acquaintances at uni, even some girls that you could call friends. But I am missing these intense friendships from school, people I could completely trust, where I could just let myself go and have fun.. basically some best friends.

I am generally liked on my course but I do think most people see me as very serious, too mature, too stiff... People I hang out with often say how ""middle aged"" I am. Which is fine because I guess it is true and it has its reasons. I would love to be less serious and enjoy life more spontaneously but it scares me and reminds me of some horrible manic things I did. 

It is hard to sum this up to some precise questions but basically I'd like to know what I can change in order to find true friendship again? How can I let go of my fears and find a middle ground between crazy outgoing and lonely hermit? And this last one just came to me in the process of writing: I've dropped many things that were ""classic me"" and all that's left is this weird middle aged career-driven me. Do I need to find myself/my passions first before I can go and find people that could be my good friends?

TITLE: My [20/m] Girlfriend [22/f] might not get into the grad school she wants to.

POST: Basically, my girlfriend might not be able to get into her desired grad school due to certain academic and financial complications. She has one or two courses with an undesirable grade, and wants to retake those courses. But with college tuition costing as much as it does today, it's putting her in a difficult position because she can't retake the courses for an improved grade. I honestly wish that I could help her out and pay for everything, but I have my own increasing tuition fees to cover plus housing.

I'm trying to support her and help her through this the best I can, but it just seems like there isn't much I can do... Or at least, none comes to my mind. This is pretty major source of stress and unhappiness right now, for the both of us. She's been crying about it almost every night, she's also become irritable and somewhat cold and detached. I've been giving her more space, and just being there when she needs me. But I can't help feeling extremely useless and helpless right now, and it's probably one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced. Is there anything I can do to make things a little easier, ease the stress a bit. I just want to see her smile again...

TITLE: Me and my wife [30 M,F] with my parents [60's M,F] are spoiling our baby (8 months) and won't listen to our parenting plan/rules

POST: We are all from a different country living in the USA. So when my dad actually found a job here my parent's moved with us (it was less demanding, only 3 days a week). They thought it would be good as my wife was pregnant and they could help out. They would've come here for a few months to help out anyway but this seemed to work out very well. 
Now they have been here 2 years and while everything else seems to go smoothly we seem to clash a lot on parenting methods and rules. They always carry the baby around the house don't let him play on the floor, pick him up when he cries, do not let us try things out such as baby led weaning etc. We are having a lot of arguments in the last few months because of that. I am not sure how to handle this.

I don't really want to ask them to move out as it it considered disrespectful in our culture. We moved into a big house after they came and it would also put a small financial stress on both parties. My wife would also have to quit her job that she just started (it's non-paid and she is just doing it for work experience) if my parents left so she can train him for a couple months before leaving him in daycare. I wish there was a better solution but it seems to be the only thing I can think of now.

TITLE: Reddit you're my only hope.  How does one remove  years-old cum stains from painted drywall?

POST: So backstory...

When I was a teenager and masturbation was just becoming a regular thing for me (about 8 years ago), I used to do so in bed all the time.  My comforter made this nice ridge along the outside of my mattress so I could come on the other side of it and let it dry there without having to worry about rolling over in it or anything.  Our family's maid washed the sheets once a week, and since I wasn't doing this every night, I figured I was leaving no trace.

Turns out I was wrong.

I should mention here that I slept in a bunk bed, on the top bunk.  There was no one sleeping on bottom, I just liked sleeping up there.  In any case, when I was in high school, long after I'd moved on from masturbating in bed, I noticed some stains on the wall when I was in the bottom bunk reading.  It looked like someone had dribbled coke or something on the wall and the syrup had dried into these little browning streaks.  I couldn't see their origins, but it was clear they'd come from above.  I investigated and found several impact sites, unmistakably wrought by my pubescent self-exploration.

I freaked out a little and tried scrubbing them off, but when that didn't work I realized that it probably wouldn't ever matter; no one ever had any reason to get close enough to this wall in my room to notice and I doubted my family would ever have a need to move the bed, thereby discovering my embarrassing secret.  I turned out to be wrong about that too.

I'm at college now, and my mom recently informed me they're redoing the carpet in my old room this summer.  That means they're definitely going to find it.  I'm going back to house-sit next weekend though;  my family will be gone.  It's just gonna be me and whatever cleaning methods you guys can come up with.

TITLE: 10+ yrs of relationship, 2 kids. Trust?

POST: First time on here. I (m28) with my girlfriend (f28) for 10yrs+. We broke up for about a year a couple of years back (1 kid at this stage) obviously both went off on the single scene.

We got back together and had another kid together. Recently I found out she was with a guy that she worked with years ago. They had been ""friends"" and texting each other on and off over the years. But when  we weren't together she ended up sleeping with this guy. He had a girlfriend at the time, think he still does.

I recently confronted my partner about this and she told me that she didn't see any harm in texting him when we were together originally because ""nothing happened"". I'm finding it hard to believe that a guy would keep interest after 8 yrs (when they originally met) if he wasn't getting anywhere (unless they were just friends)

Usually if this was one of my friends in this situation, I'd say fuck her. But the problem is we have 2 children and I can't bear the thought of not seeing them everyday. Or them growing up in a broken home.

I don't know whether to believe what she is telling me or what to do. I can't think properly about the whole situation, I'm lost! 

To make it worse, I found out where the guy lives and the temptention to fuck him up is going through my head. Have thought about finding his girlfriend and telling her. (They have been in a longterm relationship aswell as far as I know)

TITLE: I feel so great. I just got over a past relationship in the least likely possible way.

POST: So I broke up with my SO about 4 months ago - it was the cleanest possible breakup, due entirely to conflicting schedules and lack of time, so there was really no impetus for me to move on. We tried to be friends afterward and did our best, but communication quickly tapered off. I assumed from the lack of emotions I was feeling toward her and the lack of communication that I was getting over her.

Then this week she visited my city.

She invited a bunch of our old friends (and myself) out for dinner, so I figured, sure, why not, let's cement her status as a friend. This will be casual enough.

And it was. We had a great time, laughed like crazy, and found ourselves finishing each other's sentences like we did when we first fell for each other. It was a really fun night, closed with a loving goodbye hug.

I say loving because the second I go, reality smacked me in the face. I was still in love with her, just as much as when I broke up with her. I spent the night brooding over it, and decided that the best course of action was to be blunt about it. I texted her the next day telling her in fairly simple terms what the night had done for me - it made me realize I was still head over heels for her.

And she never responded.

I'm entirely okay with that. Hell, I'm happy about that. It put things into perspective. Four months of acting like I was okay with being friends with a girl I never even had the chance to see that way wore on me. I realized how much self-respect I was abandoning just by keeping up this charade and allowing her to be how I validated myself.

And, honestly? Fuck that. I'm awesome, and I don't need her to tell me that to know it. I feel like I've lifted a weight from my shoulders, and for the first time in four months I'm genuinely happy to be single. For the first time in four months I feel like a man instead of a teenager. I'm free from love because I told her I loved her.

TITLE: I'm(f/17) crazy in love, but how to explain this to my family?

POST: Hi Reddit, I need your help!

Just a few weeks ago I met this guy(m/23) and we had this 'click' right from the start. I was at a small party and I met him there. I was the youngest, I knew, everyone called me a 'jailbait' so I knew everyone was at least 1 or 2 years older than me.

I had come there because a good girl friend of mine(f/20) asked me to come, and said it would be fun. I didn't want to go at first, but she begged me to, so I thought I'd just go to make her happy.

The guy I met and I talked for hours straight. When the party was over and I was back home again, we continued whatsapping, facebooking and skyping for hours nonstop. We have so much in common - we say the same things at the same time, we feel the same way about basically everything!

Now, I have two problems here. First one is, that the girl that wanted me to come to the party, is a lesbian, I never thought anything of it - but apparently she's fallen in love with me. She is one of my closest friends. How do I politely tell her that I'm not going to date her? She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian. At least, that's what it feels like.

Second, I really like the guy. I found out he was 23 later because he was ashamed of his age at first. We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. 

For Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just... How do I tell my mom?

Now to get to the nitty gritty.
Recently I have been becoming less and less attracted to my gf. She put on a good amount of weight in a short amount if time, now usually this wouldn't bother me all too much. However, when coupled with her lack of ""drive"" in life the unattractiveness doubles. She doesn't seem too interested in advancing into some type of job with benefits and is comfortable with working her low wage-10 to15 hour workweek. 

Secondly there are huge issues with my family and her, now unfortunately I'm on my phone so I'll make it short, she is not interested in mending problems with my family members that have occurred in the past year or so. These unmended problems cause a bit of stress for me and have actually strained relationships with family members of my own.

POST: As you have more than likely deduced from the title(for the love of God I hope you did at least), we are starting a new non-profit in South FL. Our goal is to provide middle-school-aged kids from our area a place they can come after school a few days a week(we will have schedules for ages/classes) and learn the basics of web/mobile design and programming(and intermediate classes as well).

Our number one goal is to provide this for free to kids in low-income households, heck even families making 60k a year in South FL still cannot afford more than a small 2 bedroom apartment with the cost of living down here, forget about the cost of sending your kid to get programming lessons. We will have a small fee for kids whose families can afford it (our initial thought is around $100 a month).

We already have a location central to the schools in our area, and easy to get to from anywhere. We are working on getting the necessary licenses and completing the needed paperwork... and here is where we need our name.

The foreseeable future will be digital and children who can get a head start in learning the basics of programming and web/mobile design will have a distinct advantage as they continue to grow into productive members of our society. We want to provide an avenue that would not be available to these kids otherwise--many of which do not even have a computer or the internet at home. If they can get a head start, they can improve their situation in life, and maybe they will have an idea they bring to fruition that improves the lives of people everywhere... that's our dream at least.

TITLE: Me [21F] and my ex [21M] are going travelling together in three weeks...am I overthinking things?

POST: For some backstory, I lived on campus for uni. My ex ended up moving in next door to me and we quickly became really close. He was on exchange for a year from a university in England, and we hit it off FAST.

Because of the fact that our units were next to each other, we ended up living together. We cooked together, stayed together every night, studied together etc. But we knew that he would be have to go back to England to complete his Masters. We discussed this early into the relationship, and decided on a mutual breakup for when he leaves. At the time I thought, ""yeah, I can handle this. I have a lot of time to prepare, we'll just enjoy this while it lasts.""
I was very wrong. We fell so in love with one another, and he became my best friend. He's been back in England for almost two months now, but we still talk like we are a couple, and we ended up planning a trip together. In about three weeks, I am going to England for two weeks to travel with him (his suggestion, but we had both talked about it before)

I'm not really sure how to approach the time in between, before I go to England. We act like a couple, skyping/messaging (he recently sent me a letter telling me he loved me and a handmade bookmark from a tree in his garden) but we haven't explicitly talked about what this is. 

I mean, I don't know if we are casually seeing other people? Just the other night he said he was meeting a female friend to catch up, but he messaged me when he got home and that was almost 5 am his time and kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, because I automatically assumed things, despite how every other day he tells me he misses me and talks about all the things he is planning for when I am there.  

Do I wait until I'm there to have that conversation about what this is? I know communication is absolutely key, but I don't want to risk awkwardness/disappointment before going there, and sometimes things are miss-communicated when not talking face to face.
Advice?

I dated this girl, let's call her C, for about a year. We never made things official but we were loyal to each other (as far as I know...). Things were amazing, we went out a lot, never fought, and had great chemistry. Then it all ended.

She was having family and work issues so things weren't too great at her home. She was being distant and I knew something wasn't right. I get a text from her saying how she thinks it's best for us to be friends ""for now"" because too much was going on and she couldn't handle dating. I completely understood and figured I should support her. But things just got really messy afterwards. 

I would find out she'd be talking to other girls, flirting and even opened up her dating profile again. I felt like she was trying to move on and meet new people. She kept insisting that she wasn't looking for anything but her actions showed otherwise. I even found out that she ended up hooking up with a friend she visited on the East coast, this was while we were still sort of hooking up too.

I asked her what exactly happened between us, if I did anything wrong because it was just so sudden. She kept insisting that I did nothing wrong. I was amazing to her, treated her amazingly and it was nothing against me. I can't wrap my head around that. She's told me I'm everything she looks for in a SO but yet it was so easy for her to just leave. 

We had stopped talking because she ended up getting back together with her ex (before me). None of her actions make sense to me. She keeps insisting I did nothing wrong but I can't help but feel like something must've happened. I think me not knowing makes it harder to let her go. We are talking again, sort of, but I just don't know what to do, or think.

TL;DR:","  SO of 1 year abruptly ended things, lied about everything and is now seeing someone else. She keeps insisting I did nothing wrong but I can't help but feel like something happened. What do I do?","  SO left me after a year, didn't give me a real reason why, says I'm everything she wants in a girlfriend but only sees me as a friend."

TITLE: Are scholarships and grants awarded per semester or year?

POST: I am starting my third semester of college soon and do not quite understand how grants/scholarships work.

My first was in the previous academic school year over the summer and I just completed my second at the start of the current academic year.

From what I've read online it sounds like scholarships and grants are awarded one time a year, but are split up into two parts and refunded to you in those parts at the start of each semester.

So I got ~$2,500 from just the Pell Grant last semester(which went straight into my bank because scholarships pay for it all), does that mean ill get another check of ~$2,500 at the start of this upcoming semester or was that first check all i get for the year? The wording on the sites for these grants is a little strange.

TL;DR:","  Is scholarships and grants awarded per semester or year? I got ~$2,500 from Pell Grant last semester, does that mean I'll get another check of ~$2,500 at the start of this semester?",  Are grants split into 2 parts and given to me at separate times throughout the academic year or is all of it given at the start?

TITLE: How many of you search for jobs and opportunities daily until you feel sick?

POST: I have been doing tons of job searching lately with the rest of my graduating peers and I am noticing we all have the same issue. We research job sites until we are just strung out on stress. Some sites are truly better than others are, but for the most part, they lack the one thing we are all looking for a direct connection to hope.

I want to start a website just for people to post their background education/training/other, their current job, their job search process sites/interviews/etc, how they feel they got their job, and etc. Distill down the actual details of what a candidate similar to the one who posted their experience can expect to fair. There is just too much voodoo job-hunting out there. People can post if the entry-level position they applied to really wanted 5 years of experience or if they walked in fresh faced and were told not to worry. I want a site for average people seeking employment to come and find out the truth. My wife even says that further down the road we could integrate connections where you can offer to mentor a certain number of similarly people to yourself and help them enter into jobs at your company or others that may be of the same industry.

There is just too much BS out there and people are getting sick of it. I want to make a job site by the people and for the people.

Is there a site like this? In addition, if I just small budget it and build it in wordpress or phpbb will people come? How should I lay it out?

I really want to help people because I do not like the suffering going on right now.

I love her SO much that I want to make sure I do what's best for her.

But I was very into her and tried to move on with her. But it's been, as I mentioned, a year and a half and I still am not entirely over my ex, to a degree I can't even hide. I just am sad a lot. Or I bring my ex up in conversation despite trying to remember not to (we were together for a long time, 7 years). And I know it hurts her. But the only alternative is to hide it, which feels extremely insincere. I can't even tell if it will ever get better or go away. How can I stop hurting her? I want to, but I don't feel like I can even trust my own healing process here. Is the only right thing to do to leave her and be alone and... just wait until I get back to neutral?

TITLE: I [26/m] am worried I don't love her [26/f] enough

POST: The other night, my gf (26) told me (26m) she doesn't feel like we spend enough time together, and that she doesn't feel that she's very high on my list of priorities.

The trouble is, I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm not head-over-heels in love with her; she's not dwelling in my every thought. But I do love her; I think she is a wonderful person. I enjoy spending time around her. I want to make her happy and make her feel as special as she makes me feel. But I'm also incredibly busy. I also deeply cherish my alone time. I pretty much constantly feel like I'm running around. 

Still, I've made sure to have some manner of dedicated date night each week, as well as a night or two where we stay together or tag along to one another's functions/events/shows/gatherings. On average, I'd say we see one another three times a week.

Even more frustrating is that she often outright rejects some of the nice things I try to say. She'll cringe or roll her eyes when I compliment her, and even the other night said she didn't believe me when I said I'd been looking forward to seeing her all day. At first, it was kind of sweetly self-effacing, but I'm starting to feel undercut, like I'm just fighting this uphill battle to let her know she's special to me. 

Writing this out, it sounds like she's in the wrong, but I truly feel guilty about how disproportionate our relationship is. I think I am making an effort, and I do nice things and try to show that I'm thinking of her, but I'm still constantly aware of how much more she likes me and how much more invested she seems in the relationship than I am.

I know this is kinda a lot of stuff with no concrete issue and a lot going on at once; any insight would be appreciated.

TITLE: Redditors that have received an OWI, what's your story?

POST: First off, I'm not bragging about anything, and I'm very disappointed in myself and learned my lesson. I was 18 years old in high school, and we had a snow day from school. My buddies called me and said ""let's drink, my parents are at work and I want to have beer cracked by noon"", so I said let's do it. It was a Wednesday. I had to work at 4:00, but figured I'd have a couple. I was young and dumb, and ended up getting completely hammered playing minefield all afternoon (a game consisting of a lot of drinking). I don't know why I did it but I kept drinking, and left my friends house at 3:30. On my way to work, I dropped my ipod on the floor while changing the song and began deviating into the lane next to me, thank god nobody was around, except for the police officer behind me who immediately pulled me over. He came up to the car and could smell the alcohol immediately, and the entire process for the DUI began there (sobriety test, cuffed up and put in the back of the cop car and brought to the hospital for a blood test). My father picked me up with a cigar in his mouth, a month after he had quit smoking. When I asked why he was smoking, he responded ""You made me"", the utmost disappointment I've ever experienced in my life. I learned my lesson and it'll never happen again. Everybody in school heard about it, and I had to call my boss to tell him I wasn't making it to work, and for some reason or another he didn't fire me, and I can't imagine what would have happened if he had since I had this hefty fine, alcohol assessment and class, ridiculously high car insurance and towing fees to pay. I'm extremely thankful I didn't hurt anybody and I learned my lesson when I was young.

TITLE: [13M] My grandmother [56F] recently started smoking after already having quit years ago, trying to make her stop.

POST: My grandmother (whom I live with, if that's important at all), a very interesting lady, has recently started smoking again. For about a year or two she didn't smoke, which ironically enough she decided to do herself, and as far as I know, she quit cold turkey.

Recently, however, she's taken it up as a habit again, and I'm really worried for her health. I've learned many of times about all of the harmful effects that cigarettes have on your body, and my grandmother has already beat cancer once (when I was too young to remember) and I really don't want to have to endure that again.

She always smokes out on our front porch, so it's relatively easy to catch her smoking when I'm around the house, but I start school in a few days and I know she'll use that time to smoke when I'm not home. Even when I am around, she gets really mad whenever I catch her. Apparently, me forcing her to put out the cigarette and lecturing her about how she can die is not enough to make her quit like she did before.

Is there anything I can do to make her stop? I'm really worried that she could get ill, and I'm not really at a position where I'm ready to lose another parent. (referring to my biological parents, my grandfather is still around but only on the weekends and is seemingly okay with the smoking)

We went out for a bit and it was amazing at first but I was so head over heels I said and did some really embaressing things, got clingy and made an idiot of myself like I had no idea I was capable of.

And while I really liked her at first and enjoy being with her, along with everything that comes with it, I still can't get past my ex.  Everything she does I just remember how my ex did it and how much more in tune I was with it.  Everything she did just made so much sense to me, and this one (even though she is great and I am happy with the time I've spent with her) just doesn't make me feel that way.

TITLE: TIFU by dating a crazy.

POST: As usual, this did not happen today, or even this year. Probably was about 4 years ago, making me around 15.
I'd been dating this girl (let's call her Emma) on and off for about a year, and by nature of being a stupid 15 year old male, didn't decide to bail permanently during any of the previous breakups.

So about a month after we get back together once more, I'm at her house, hanging with her and a pair of mutual friends.
One of these friends decides to make what he decided was a hilarious comment comparing the nearby beach to the wet spot that had developed on her whilst sitting on my lap.

I laughed.

She promptly decided to hop up, and walk into the kitchen. Nothing unusual yet, so I'm sitting talking about stupid teenage stuff with my friend, whilst her friend has gone to check on her in the kitchen. They've been in there for a while when my friend decided he's gonna leave, and so I'm left alone, which suits me fine because my teenage brain is hoping I'll get time alone with Emma.

About a minute later, Emma emerges with a butchers knife and a smile. It was not a great combination. Her friend is in the hallway behind her, she's watching in a bit of shocked horror. Sensing that my welcome had run out, I stood up, at which point Emma announced she was going to castrate me as a punishment for being a horny teenager.

The following few moments of my comprehension of the statement and my rapid running the fuck away from her passed very quickly, and in my rush I took a wrong turn and ended up in a linen closet. Fuck.

Turns out that as she was chasing me, her friend tried to grab her arm, got nicked by the knife, and went into shock.
Emma breaks out of crazy mode and calls out for help. Apparently her protective instincts only extend to her female friends.

Anyway, I end up consoling her friend whilst we wait for her mum to arrive and drive her to the hospital on the pretext of a cooking accident with knives.

Now heres where it gets really bad. I still dated her for another year or so.

TITLE: Should I [16M] try to get back together with my ex [16F]?

POST: First time posting here, sorry if I screwed something up.

About a year ago my girlfriend of roughly 6 months broke up with me. It wasn't the perfect relationship. We both made mistakes, but I really loved her.

A few weeks before the breakup she started being very distant and quiet. I tried talking to her, but she just never wanted to say anything to me. She just shut down whenever I tried to talk to her.

The breakup was nothing noteworthy. She just walked up to me one day, said she was done with it, and left. It really broke me down and I spent a very long time moping.

The following months were summer vacation, so we didn't have much contact and I just went around being sad. 

The first few months of school were really tough for me because we have many mutual friends and classes so we saw each other a lot. The only contact we had were occasional glances and uncomfortable conversations between classes.

Then she started dating one of my close friends. Seeing her move on really hurt, but I knew I couldn't get mad about it. I tried to find love in someone else, but there was nobody that made me feel like she did. Their relationship ended after about two months.

In recent months, we've been having longer conversations and I'm much more comfortable with her now. One thing I have noticed is that she talks to me more if we're alone, not really if there are many people around. I'm getting mixed signals from her.

My friends have encouraged me to ask her out again, one of which is the guy she dated after breaking up with me. We are both different people and I've learned a lot, so I know I can be better to her than before. I still care about her, and I feel like a part of her still cares about me.

One of my worries if I do this is that she'll just shut down again one day. Once that happens it's like she puts up a wall that is impossible to break down. 

I am overly analytical and I've been running through this in my mind for months with no results. I need help making a decision.

POST: My boyfriend Robert and I have been together for two years this coming October. Last November, he moved to another city 3 hours away for a better paying job, but he totally regrets the decision and now is actively looking for jobs in the city that I live and we met in.

I just graduated from college in August and I'm currently renting out a room in a couple's townhouse, but have already started making arrangements to move in with a girl friend after she graduates from college in January. Naturally, since I'm in a LDR and just graduated, people ask me questions about how Robert and I are doing and what I'm doing next. After I tell them that my boyfriend is moving back, they ask if we're moving in together. I say no, and most people are pretty shocked, asking me why wouldn't I want to move in together since we must miss each other so much? People will actively engage in a conversation with me about how weird we are and it really annoys me. I never thought people would be so shocked at mine and Robert's decision.

Robert and I have talked about the possibility of moving in together and we both agree that neither of us are ready. We're both trying to build our careers and think that going from LDR to living together is way too drastic of a change. Also, Robert broke up with me last year around my birthday; we got back together six weeks after. Although I've forgiven him, I still have suppressed feelings about it and deep down it still hurts a bit. I'd be lying if I said that doesn't factor into my decision not to move in together just now.
 
My question is, what's the typical timetable for a couple to live together? I know every couple is different, but what is the general consensus? Also, we're not the type of couple that needs to be married before we move in together, that much we know for sure.

I'm constantly out doing stuff, whether it be running and being active or making plans to go do active stuff, i.e. being outside. They never seem excited to do these sorts of things and would rather spend their nights inside, watching Netflix, drinking liquor/beer, or playing video games. It's really frustrating sometimes.

I just hate that they never want to be active and go to events/places like I do. It's always a fight for ""time"" and ""money"" and ""getting off work"", etc, etc - the list goes on. But I know that's it mostly bullshit because they are happy to plan an event where we get together at someone's house just to drink and have fun.

I don't know what to do. I understand that I can meet more people who are into a similar lifestyle as mine (thank god my girlfriend is an active person), but I've known these guys for so long, I just wish I could motivate them into losing weight and being active - they have no idea what kind of life they're missing.

TL;DR:",  My close friends are overweight and lazy and never want to put effort into anything. It's really frustrating to spend time with them and wish they would change. What can I do to motivate them to be more active?,  My friends are all lazy and don't want to be active - I feel like it's making me miss out on opportunities.

TITLE: TIFU by loving my SO

POST: Hello TIFU, please let me point out I'm bad at formatting, in a rush, and tired so please be kind. Now let's get started

Today I was waiting with my gf after school at her bus stop so we started to play (not in a sexual way you pervs). Here's the scene, I'm a reasonably well built guy and my SO is very short and very skinny. I'm holding her with my arm and I poke her nose, then she pokes my noise, then I poke her nose, then I we start saying random phrases like ""meep"" or ""boop"" or ""oy"". Suddenly our principal comes up and says:

""Keep that up and you'll come to my office for a nice loooong chat"".

Now he's known as being quite a jokester so I just laugh a bit. After about 15 seconds he hasn't broken his cold unforgiving stare with a smile that's becoming creepy. I get a slightly confused look on my face and look to my gf for backup and of course she's looking elsewhere. I ask him:

""Wait, sir I'm confused, what's happening exactly?""

He get's very close and says:

""You better let her go or else you're coming with me."" No smile, murder in his voice.
At this point I imagine a mass effect choice menu with these options: point out we're dating, let my go of my gf and nod my head and say okay, pretend I only speak Russian, become a ninja and spin kick him in the throat. I froze up and just muttered 'okay' and let my go of my gf. Then he says 'better' and just walks away. After he left we just sort awkwardly laughed it off and we're joking about it right now.

TL;DR:","  Was waiting with my gf at bus stop, poke nose, principal comes up and says you better let her go or else you're coming with me. Just laughed it off and are joking about it right now.",  holding your SO and playing a game of boop = assault/sexual harrasment but it all ended well.

TITLE: 3 car accident and I was put at fault. What do I do?

POST: No point in explaining how the accident went down. I was in a 3 car accident and the insurance companies put me at fault for the accident. I tried fighting this but I could tell it wasn't going anywhere..

I live in California, and the accident took place in a fairly wealthy neighborhood. My car got t-boned and the first two other cars I hit were essentially totaled (mine included). The last car drove away with a dent. I only had partial insurance so my side of the insurance only covered a small portion of the damages. 

Yesterday I received a letter from a law firm explaining that I need to pay the rest of the damages (something in the $11,000 range). I'm a poor college student and have never even seen half of that amount in my bank account. I'm too scared to even respond to that letter, I can't afford that much money and I know that there is probably going to be a second letter on the way..

What do I do?

I (21F) met this guy (21 or 22M) back in March visiting my friends at their college. We spent the night together. We didn't have sex, but we did fool around a bit. He seemed genuinely interested in me and sweet and even walked me back to my friend's apartment in the morning. While talking we figured out that he's moving to the same city I currently attend college in for a really good job. 

Fast forward to now, he's here and texted me. I live in a suburb not too far away and am going back to school for the semester on Wednesday. I texted him a couple times since March, but he only reached out once in July to tell me he was here. I asked him out, I thought it went well, but he insisted he was too busy to see me before I went on a 2 week vacation abroad. I just got back yesterday. So.. do I text him? Or wait for him to come to me? I don't want to scare him off, but I am interested in pursuing this further. He seems really great despite us only having met once. It's rare I crush on someone that would actually probably be good for me. Please help.

TITLE: Me [18F] with my boyfriend [18 M], acts like we don't have sex enough

POST: Hi reddit, first time posting. I have been lurking for a while.

I've been with my boyfriend Alex for 12 months. We live together, and have a good relationship apart from little arguments about chores and stuff.

Lately he has been acting like we're not having sex enough. He will drop things in the conversation about how he doesn't feel attractive, and if his weight is a problem (it isn't, he's pretty ripped) and asks why I don't touch him more. Just general things like that. When I try to tell him I don't think we have sex too little, he agrees with me and acts like nothing is wrong, but in a way that tells me he just doesn't want to upset me.

I do reject him 50% of the times he tries to start something. I have a weak immune system, and I get sick alot and don't really feel like sleeping with him. Another thing is I recently went through losing a 5 week old puppy I rescued and bottlefed to parvovirus. I don't want to bring this up to him because it will sound like an excuse, but I nursed that little guy and syringe fed him for 2 weeks and losing him really messed me up.

I'm rambling a bit, so my main problem with him acting like this is I think we have sex more than enough. On an average day, we have sex 4-5 times in a long session, rather than multiple single times a day. I'm wondering if maybe he doesn't see it as much because it's all in one big chunk. I make sure we do it so much because I want to keep him satisfied, even if I'm not feeling 100%. I can't help but feel a bit unappreciated. 

Mainly asking this so I can read your responses and see high libido perspectives, and so we can see what people think after we have a talk about it.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend acts like we don't have sex enough and it's putting a strain on our relationship. I think we have sex more than enough on an average day. Wondering if anyone has a different perspective.,"  boyfriend doesn't act like we have sex enough, we do it 3-4 times a day on average. Want to show him redditor views"

TITLE: I can't stop binging lately and I am starting to feel worthless...

POST: Some background: I started my weight loss back in September (starting at 164lbs) and have lost about 35 pounds now. I did this by calorie counting, portion control, C25K and weight lifting. Currently 5'5'/f/130ish lbs, running 20-30 miles a week, lifting about 1-2 times a week and added in cycling 1-2 times a week. I'm also training for my first half marathon that's in June.

So, the actual story: For the past few weeks I have had some major issues with binging. I will just open up the pantry and just start eating handfuls of everything in sight. I'll munch on chips, cereal, crackers, peanut butter... Last week I just sat with the peanut butter and a spoon and just ate straight out of the jar, probably around 5-6 servings. Two nights ago I sat on the couch with a box of cereal and ended up eating half of the box. 

Last night was awful and my worst binge yet. I thought it would be nice to make those [individual bacon egg bake] that I can eat for breakfast. I ended up eating one, which is fine. It barely put me over my calorie limit for the day. Then I decided I was going to make that cookie mix I had sitting in the pantry. I ended up eating about 1/4 of the cookie dough and had 3 cookies after they were done baking. After eating all of this I felt horrible and actually made myself throw it all back up. 

I feel like this is my lowest point I have ever been in my life. I'm just not sure where to go from here. I'm not actively trying to lose like I was in the beginning but this is not healthy, especially after what I did last night. I tell myself I need to stop eating but its like my hand cannot stop shoving food into my mouth. I never had any issues like this in the beginning and actually had no issues stopping after having 1 serving of chips or 1 cookie. 

I really just need some advice, encouragement, motivation or how you got over something similar. I need to stop this madness and get back on track!! :(

TL;DR:","  I can't stop binge eating lately and feel like I am worthless after eating all of it. Need advice, encouragement or how you got over something similar.",  Lost 35lbs since September. I have been binging a lot lately and last night even made myself throw up after my binge. I feel like I am starting to become depressed and need to know how to get back on track!

TITLE: My [23F] boyfriend [26M] of 2 and 1/2 years dropped the bomb that he wants to break up

POST: My boyfriend of two and a half years dropped the bomb on me that he wants to break up.

I've supported him through everything.  From losing his license, to getting laid off at work, to finding out his brother is an addict, to dealing with a crazy ex, and more.

His reasons are he is frustrated by my poor stress management and also he has just decided that he doesn't want a long term relationship anymore. 

I have anxiety, it's something I've had my whole life.  I went to therapy for it years ago and also last year again and I admitted that lately I have dropped the ball with it.  I have been talking to my doctor recently about exploring some new options, maybe considering medication.  His situations don't help with my anxiety or overall stress but other than that the relationship has been awesome. We have a lot of fun together and we share a lot of the same views about life and where we want to go in the future.  We have so much in common and our personalities go together great.  He has been a great boyfriend up until the last couple of months.  When I brought it up to him that things are getting a little one sided that's when he told me he wants out.

Last week he did have a pretty big falling out with his best friend over some stressful stuff (friendship ending type stuff) and on top of that he said he has been under a lot of stress at work.  I'm wondering if this sudden decision is just him poorly handling stress and trying to shut down and not deal with our situation instead of resolve it.

I managed to get him to think about reconsidering this week and we would talk again on Friday.  Obviously I am hoping he chooses to try to work things out but honestly I think I am going to get broken up with a second time.  

Almost everyone I talked to about it thinks there's another girl he's not telling me about.  I want to break the silence we are supposed to be keeping and ask but I don't want to drive him away even more. I also don't think I can hang in there until Friday.

help.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend of 2 and a half years just told me he wants out citing stress and not wanting a long term relationship anymore.  Everyone I talk to thinks there's another girl.  Should I stay or should I go?,  boyfriend breaks up with me out of the blue because he claims I have poor stress management and doesn't want a long term relationship anymore.

TITLE: My ""friends"" [17 M, 18 F, 17 M] played an incredibly cruel prank on me [17M] and my boyfriend [18 M]

POST: The entire group is currently staying at 17M's house for a week long vacation. There are two couples- me and my boyfriend, and the host with his girlfriend. There is one fifth wheel.

Last night at around 1 AM, my boyfriend and I were fooling around in our room. Suddenly the fifth wheel barges in, totally unexpectedly, yelling an inside joke and throwing a condom at us, and running away. We were fully clothed, but PISSED. It was incredibly fucked up and we were both shocked. It was obviously the idea of all three of the remaining group.

My boyfriend and I confronted them, after we both calmed down. We cant understand how they thought this would be funny, as it is so fucked up on so many different levels. We could have been doing anything from sleeping to being naked. What did they expect to see? Did they expect us to just laugh it off? 

What bothers me most is that the host doesnt seem to be remorseful at all, even though he clearly agreed to this and suggested the idea. He blamed the fifth wheel for everything and said that he doesnt owe us an apology. This shocks me because its completely out of character for him, hes usually very politically correct and gentlemanly. He was a perfect host up till now and we were incredibly grateful for everything hes done for us during the vacation.

Anyways there are 2 days left in the vacation and I dont know what to do right now. Its the morning after so we need to see them soon. Obviously we need to talk as a group, but I really dont know what to do if the host continues his attitude.

TITLE: how do I get this girl's number

POST: So last friday, when i got off work, a girl stopped her car near me and offered me a ride.
It turned out that she lived near my place and often saw me waiting for buses.
I was kinda surprised and didnt get a chance to ask for her number on the way home (the ride was about 15mins), but we did have an enjoyable conversation.
When she was dropping me off, she told me that she's moving to somewhere else and this was prbly the last time she d give me a ride(also the first time :S).
After that I rlly regret not getting her number...I spent 2 hours on facebook trying to search her profile (I at least got to know her name obviously...), but it doesnt seem like she has one.

BUT this morning, I saw her getting off the car near my workplace, it turned out that she just works across the street!
What a coincidence! But as I was already 20mins late for work, I was in such a hurry, didnt get a chacne to ask her num.

Now, at work, I ve been thinking for whole day what I should do to approach her.

Should I wait for her after work and start a convo? Or should I leave a message that has my number on it and have ""text me :)"" written on it?

This could be big for me. She is a white girl and I'm azn, and u guys can prbly already tell english isnt even my first language.

TITLE: I (27F) have a bit of a dilemma with my roommate (30M)...

POST: Throwaway cuz' I have friends on here.

I've lived with my roommate for a month and known him for as long. Long story, but I was in a bad situation and desperate to get out, he was also, so when someone recommended we be roommates, we jumped at the opportunity. Despite not knowing each other before moving in, we've realized we're a lot alike and we've actually become pretty great friends. He's a cool person and I enjoy his company.

Here's where it gets a little complicated. I've slept with him. Three times. And most nights when he gets off work, we snuggle together on the futon and watch a movie and end up falling asleep spooning. I figured we just had FWB type thing going on while we're both between GFs/BFs, so I've tried to not be weird about it and just act normally. Tonight though, while we were snuggled on the futon watching a movie, he laid his head on my lap, kissed my stomach and my thigh, then told me he loves me. I kinda tried to chuckle it off, because I figured he was high/supertired/half asleep (although I don't honestly think that he was) and didn't know what he was saying, but he asked me if I heard him then he repeated it. I just stroked his hair and told him to get some rest and he went to sleep. What do I do now? Do I pretend like he didn't say it or I didn't hear it and wait to see if he brings it up? Should ***I*** bring it up? And what do I say if he does? I seriously don't want to compromise or complicate my living situation, since I have nowhere else to go.

POST: Obligatory this wasn't today, it was actually years ago in third grade.

My crush (let us call him Gary) offered to let me borrow a pencil when I didn't have one, and of course, I was excited as hell. Later that day in class, I wanted to tell him something (I sat next to him) so I tapped his shoulder with what I thought was the eraser end of the pencil. Well, it apparently was more like a stab than a tap and it was with the freshly sharpened end of the pencil.

IIRC, Gary yelped and the whole class looked at me, including the teacher.

Fortunately, my teacher didn't make me flip my card, and I don't think any blood was drawn from Gary.

This is my first relationship, and I do not want to break up with my girlfriend. I know this is a very simple thing to say as a high schooler, but my question is whether I get mad at her about is justifiable. 

Recently, she has been more distant with me and has not been replying to me as fast or with the same upbeat attitude she's had in the past. As a result, I do not feel the love in the relationship as much as I once did. It seems like her attitude is affecting me to not be as talkative which has led me to call her out on this. I've asked her multiple times to tell me why she seems more distant and if it's a problem with me, but she keeps saying, ""idk, sorry"". At this point, I got tired of it and told her that I won't talk to her until she wants to start a conversation for once and not seem like I'm boring her.

POST: This is my first post, and on a throwaway account because boyfriend and I are both redditors. 

My boyfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship. We met online and talked for a few months before meeting up, and it was amazing. I didn't agree to be his girlfriend until a few months after we became an official 'thing' due to trust issues I have from being in a prior relationship where I was cheated on. My boyfriend understands these problems as he was cheated on as well, and swore to never lie to me or cheat on me (in writing, lol). 

We had sex 8 days ago on my birthday, and he was my first. He says I was his first as well. 

However, upon my random stalking of old reddit posts of his (I do this when I'm missing him), I found that he posted on a subreddit asking for advice on how to get custom condoms sent to his house because 'blah blah brands give me the red ring of death'. I can't understand any other reason as to why he would have done this other than the fact that he had sex with the girl he was with before and lied to me. This also confuses me because he said they never even kissed or held hands but were a 'thing' for nearly a year. The post was a year ago. 

He's sleeping right now and I've texted and called him (he's a heavy sleeper). It's 1:00 a.m. my time and I can't even focus on anything other than being miserable right now. How do I proceed? Should I even entertain his possible explanation?

Things seemed to be going downhill for a while I guess (can barely remember the last time we had sex) but she had exams and was stressed so I was just hoping for her to snap out of it but apparently she isnt going to.

What Im asking is what is the best way we can remain friends without me getting my heart broken. I'm suprisingly ok with the breakup so far perhaps because things have been getting more and more platonic anyway so we are just friends even if I want to be more than that.

I've been dating her for just over a month and today we were about to have sex and went through foreplay and I couldn't get a hard on because I just wanted feeling it. She took this as it was her fault I couldn't get it and lost all mood and blamed it on herself and I told her it wasn't but because I was nervous a bit because I liked her. She then tells me she hasn't gone down this road in a relationship before, she is afraid because she might ruin it and what not. She tells me either we can just be friends and have no more kissing/sex or we can just have sex and no emotion with it. She tells me if I pick the sex one then I have to be okay with her getting with other guys and I'm not okay with that because I like her and truly would be jealous. It's just a part of me.

By the end the mood became more cheerful, we went through some old photos of us. BUT at the end of the night when I left, there was no goodbye kiss, just a solid goodbye. I feel sad because I really really like this girl and she is my prom date too which is in a month and if things go south I just feel like I can't emotional be around her because it will hurt me too much.

What should I do?",  Girl I'm with is very conflicted on where she stands with me and gave me the choice of either being friends or open relationship fuck buddies. What can I do!

TITLE: I (21m) cant seem to get over my ex-girlfriend (21f). And its taking a toll on my life.

POST: Hi guys, ive been lurking here for a while but i didnt really think id need any relationship advice because i considered myself strong enough to handle these problems. It seems im wrong about that.

Background: I met my ex (well call her Jocelyn) when we were both in grade 9. We fell for eachother very quickly and were inseperable throughout highschool up until our last year when she told me had feelings for someone else and we ended it.

We reconciled in the middle of first year university and were together for about 3 more years until she finally broke up with me again, stating that she just couldnt see herself marrying me (which was what we both discussed would happen eventually). I took this very hard and ended up isolating myself from friends and family and fell into a small ""hole"" as i like to call it. A lot of drinking and marijuana was involved, which only made my situation worse.

I started to gain back my confidence about 5 months after the break up when she contacted me again and asked to speak about our situation. Being the spineless person i am i agreed, and we only got together twice before she said it was a mistake and we should remain friends.

I was fine with this (although quite annoyed) and we continued to speak regularly, which i admit was a horrible idea. She told me about 3 weeks ago that shes seeing someone and we shouldnt speak anymore, ive agreed with this as it would be innapropriate to continue speaking. However, ive found myself in that ""hole"" once again. 

I continually think about her during every aspect of my day, even though i know the pain ive been through when ive been with her. I know i shouldnt and cant rely on someone else to give me happiness, but im not sure really what to do at this point. 

So after my huge ramblings (i havent really talked to anyone about all this recently), does anyone have advice on how i can get her out of my head? Its gotten to the point of obsession and it needs to stop for my own mental well being.

TL;DR:",  Still think about ex-girlfriend almost every day even though she has moved on and is seeing someone else. Its taking a toll on my mental health. How can i get her out of my head?,  I cant get over my ex girlfriend of 5 years and its causing many problems in my life. Any advice would be appreciated.

TITLE: [17/m] in a sticky situation with her [17/f], my Asian parents, and the school administration

POST: Over two years ago my girlfriend and I started dating in secret. We were in secret because my parents are (racist?) in the way that they only want me to date people from an Asian background like me, and she is white. Eventually, because our school is super small and rumors spread like crazy, the staff found out maybe about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even had to use generic words like ""girlfriend and her mom"" instead of saying names to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends, no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this, and it's very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school administration has said things such as, ""She's in a lower social class, he can do better,"" ""She's bringing his grades down"" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my parents have also said things such as ""She's white trash,"" and ""She's a gold digger,"" I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven't even spoken to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I'm not sure what to do. Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies for the next year if I get caught? Do I  make arrangements to get back together in a year? Or Do I just give up and accept it as over? All of this stress is really getting to me, and I  have no idea what the best choice is. Thanks for reading all of that, and giving me any feedback!

TL;DR:","  My Asian parents found out about my relationship with my white girlfriend, school staff spilled the beans, and now I'm in a very awkward situation. Do I risk everything to try to salvage things or just give up?","  My ""racist"" parents hate my 2 year white gf.

TITLE: I [20 M] squeeze my girlfriend [19 F] of 4 months', legs just because she likes how it feels, but she won't return the favor

POST: My girlfriend and I have our own small physical contacts that we both enjoy. I like it when she lays on my chest, she likes it when I squeeze her legs, things like that. I also like it when my hair is squeezed with a tight fist (put not pulled after the grab). I had told her I liked the feeling of that before, but never asked her to do it directly. One day when I was laying in her lap I asked if she would squeeze my hair, and she said no. When I asked her why not, she did not respond.

I was a little hurt by her denial of my simple request, not because she didn't squeeze my hair, but because she wasn't willing to do something I though it felt good, with out a justification as to why. I don't actually like to squeeze her legs, I find it painful after an extended period (she knows it hurts, I've told her), but I do it because she likes it.

Until now, I had never specifically asked for any of this kind of physical contact, but once I told her directly about my desires, she actively avoids it now.

Was I wrong to ask that of her?

Was my request unreasonable?

Should I feel hurt by her denial?

Was I expecting something I shouldn't?

TITLE: I would like to know Reddit's opinion on using Federal money to put a police officer in every primary and secondary school in the United States.

POST: Hey Reddit! Thanks for reading my post.

I personal view police officers an important resource in society and that having an officer in every school would be great. I have two reasons for this, one is that they can provide protection and the second is that they can be role models for kids that might not have one. So the protection part is pretty obvious, the officers have guns and bad guys avoid guns, but what people don't think about is that an officer can identify and take action against domestic violence. Another thing that gets overlooked is how much of a need there is for police outreach to kids in America and a police officer can do just that. By placing officers in schools you give the kids a chance to see that they are just normal people that want to help you, especially if you teach the cops how to tutor and put them in a basic Algebra class every now and then, that would turn so many lives around.

TL;DR:",  I would like to know Reddit's opinion on using federal money to put a police officer in every primary and secondary school in the United States.,  Officers can provide protection from criminals and domestic violence while doing public outreach by being role models and tutoring lower level math classes.

TITLE: My [30 F] girlfriend of 5 months just gave me [29 M] a deadline for our relationship.

POST: I've been dating this girl for 5 months now but I've known her for 3 years. It has been going really great and both of us have said that we are in love. We don't meet that often, maybe twice a week with a sleepover about every other week. I feel really good about the relationship and have been trying to increase the time we spend together to know her better and trying to introduce her to more of my friends.

However, the last time we met, she told me that she wants to settle down and needs to know where our relationship is going. She's under some pressure from her family to get married and said that I have 2 months to either propose to her or break up. I said that's not nearly enough time for me and there's no way I can make that promise. We almost broke up there but then she said that I can have 4 months and I said I need a few days to think about it. She said that she doesn't want to move in with me before marriage but will live with me for a few weeks if I want that.

This is crazy right? I feel like I was in a car accident. I don't know where this came from and why she doesn't want to give our relationship some time instead of having this deadline. I really do like her and don't want to end it but I'm really confused. Saying yes to the 4 months thing will probably put me under a lot of pressure for that time and I think it would just be bad for our relationship.

I'm not opposed to working towards marriage but I can't do that with these artificial deadlines. I'm meeting her this weekend to talk about this more, but I'm really not sure of what to say.

TITLE: TIFU by opening my water bottle.

POST: Some preliminary notes — this happened yesterday at school, and it was actually my friend who caused this whole ordeal (his bottle, his attempt to clean it). Regardless, I'll share my bland point of view since I was in attendance the entire time.

In the morning announcements, we were all instructed to empty out our lockers by the end of the day or risk losing whatever we failed to reclaim. Two friends and I — one friend, Zed (not his real name), being the character of importance — shared a locker, and the only remaining articles were our history textbooks and Zed's running shoes and opaque water bottle. Zed had told me throughout the year not to touch his bottle because it's ""a bomb"", and I never thought much of it until that day.

During our break between second and third period, the three of us returned our textbooks and went with Zed to the bathroom, who intended to wash his bottle. He unscrewed the top and dumped the contents into one of the toilets — some pale orange liquid that, to me, faintly resembled vomit. He then proceeded to the nearest sink and left the now-empty bottle under some running water. At this point in time, there was nothing in the bathroom that smelled particularly bad.

Almost instantaneously, the air was pervaded by the most putrid stench conceivable, and, by split-second deduction, we pinpoint the cause to be whatever he poured out into the toilet. Half the people in the bathroom start coughing and grunting after mere seconds, many already trying to push past me and run out. I grabbed my friends and stumbled backwards with them out into the hallway, which was already completely obstructed by people who had retreated or were reluctant to enter (the odor had already seeped well out the doorway).

Soon enough, you had a whole nauseated crowd lingering outside the bathroom, with no one besides us really knowing what was discharging that terrible redolence. I stood on the side laughing for a good ten minutes while the crowd (but not the stink) gradually thinned out, while Zed tried to save any familiar-looking soul that intended to enter the abyss.

TL;DR:","  Friend opened his water bottle, which contained some sort of putrid liquid, and the stench pervaded the entire school. People began to flee in horror.","  friend plans to wash his old water bottle, ends up saturating the building with the aroma of year-old Thai tea and unleashing olfactory Armageddon."

TITLE: Loose skin (discussion)

POST: Every progress pic I see is incredible. And I'm really motivated by seeing the results of others. Its truly inspiring to see people making healthy choices and achieving their goals. Its also great to read about obstacles overcome by sheer willpower. However, when I scroll the comments I notice that there is an overwhelming concern from everyone about loose skin after weight loss. I'm assuming that it has much to do with a fear of appearing unattractive to potential partners. I could be wrong.

This post is meant to lead to  a healthy discussion to help calm the nerves of those that might be scared of losing weight because of loose skin. 

Personally I have been there. In the past I have been afraid to start getting serious with losing weight because of the idea of loose skin.  

I have decided recently that I will cross that bridge when I get there, and that the lesser of two evils would be to have a healthier body. I'm trying desperately hard to change my life. Every day is a battle, and I'm actively choosing to disregard those negative voices that whisper to me ""but all that work will be for nothing"".  "" Why try, its too late for you to look that good."" And ""Nobody will ever be attracted to you, you're a piece of garbage."" As you can imagine, I've dealt with a lot of self image issues because of my weight. I've been picked on, and I know that I'm not the only one to have had such terrible experiences whilst being overweight. That's why I open this discussion up.

Please upvote for visability. This discussion could reach someone that would otherwise give up on their goals and aspirations. 

I hope that comments from the community might help support and motivate others to lose weight, regardless of what may happen with skin. 

I'm looking forward to gaining support from this community, and a greater feeling of togetherness. This may be the only supportive resource for some of us, and this discussion could help people tremendously.

TITLE: How do you handle people who continuously lie?

POST: Do you call them out on it or let them have their ""fun""?

There's this girl who is part of my group of friends.  I'm not super fond of her, but there's always someone in a group who rubs you the wrong way.  My biggest issue with her is that she lies constantly.  Sometimes about the most inane shit.  

Mostly I just keep quiet while she exaggerates or just flat out makes shit up, but this morning she really pissed me off.  We went to the same tech school culinary class in HS.  There was a guy in our class that ended up dying.   This was years ago.  Now one of our friends is dealing with a death in their family and I don't know if liar is jealous of the support and attention our other friend is getting, but she bold faced called this guy who died in HS her boyfriend.  Not only that, but made it out as if it was some epic love that they had.  She goes on about putting on a brave face and all this other shit.  Basically pulling from her imaginary experience to offer up advice.  

I remember her back then.  They never dated.  If I'm remembering correctly she was kind of a bitch to him actually.  I can usually tolerate her blatant bullshit, but using this guy for attention or wtfever she gets out of it is really bugging me.  I thought if I took some time to cool off I'd stop being so pissed about it, but it's over 3 hours later and I still thinks its really fucked up.

TITLE: Fiance not a fan of my best friend and her fiance...need advice!

POST: Me-(27 Female), Fiance-(26 Male)...I introduced my fiance to my best friend Marie (26) and her fiance Mark (32) about a year ago.  One of the first times we hung out as couples Marie was kind of whiny about some things and put a damper on the day for everyone.  Since then my fiance has had a bad taste in his mouth about her.

After that point he expressed to me that he was disinterested in spending time with them in the future (even though he finds Mark to be a perfectly nice guy).  I understood his point of view, but since she's my best friend I encouraged him to give her another chance.  From that point on we've enjoyed several dinners, BBQ's, etc. with them and she's never done anything to be rude or annoying to him.

However, he recently confessed to me that for the past year every time we have had these ""couple dates"" he has solely done it to ""keep me quiet"" and that he really does not want anything to do with them.  In the same convo he told me he thinks they are both very nice people and he does NOT dislike them, but that he feels he has nothing in common with them.  He says he likes spending time with all of my other friends but said he no longer wishes to spend time with Marie and Mark.

I do not want to try to tell him who to be friends with, but I guess I just don't see why if he likes them, he has to withdraw from any future time spent with them.  It would be more understandable to me if he had a strong dislike for either of them.

My question in all of this is how do I handle things now with my friends Marie and Mark when suddenly all of our time spent as couples is now reduced to the three of us?  It makes me sad because they really like my fiance and truly consider him a friend.  They have no clue that he wants nothing to do with them and has felt this way all along.  

Has anyone else experienced this?  How can I avoid hurting my friends' feelings and this being awkward for me?

POST: A few weeks ago, my friends and I went to go see a DJ. We parked in a lot with a gas station, on a side parking spot facing the street. There were no posted signs about towing, and there was clearly space for it.  We went to the show and came back to find our cars towed. Apparently this took place within minutes of us walking away. 

Being 4 kids in our early 20s on the wrong side of town at night, no money, and no transportation, we found some local police to help us out. They understand our predicament and took us 10 miles away to the tow yard. 

We arrived and got in line with around 20 others there to pick up their cars.
My friend stays to pay for his car, but in the moment I saw the tow company as essentially a group of thugs who just stole my car and were trying to extort money from me. 

The gate was open next to me where people were walking in. I saw my chance and followed them. Found my car and drove off the lot.

Minutes later I get a call from my friend, still on the lot, saying they, the tow company, had called the police and had a squad of cops and tow trucks looking for me. Luckily, I arrived home and nothing happened.

I was a little frightened, but everything seemed to work.out fine.

Today I received a letter from the tow company saying they had filed a report with the police that the car was stolen from their lot. 

In the letter they requested the $270 for the tow and said that if I didnt pay up in the next 10 days then they would ""take further action"" against me. 

Also, the tow company cc'd the letter to my cars finance agency.

This one is for new drafting mats for the drafting desks in my room. Since the program hadn't been maintained in years, all of the old mats were drawn all over and cut to shreds. I want to teach drafting as a part of my advanced class this year, but without these it's impossible.

This project isn't *as vital* but it's still important. It's model building supplies so that my students can learn how to build scale models of the theatre and their scenic designs.

TITLE: How do you sabotage your workplace?  I'll start.

POST: I work as a cook in a restaurant and ever since my old boss got fired, the new guy has been a real prick.  Even so, he's been pretty lenient about making food for yourself on the job, but has been increasingly stingy about making food for servers, runners, etc.  Not to mention he tried to short me on a paycheck.  Anyway I was never shy about taking food from work, but now I do it more than I ever did or would need to.

Taking a meal home is frowned upon--and I do it anyway--but I also find myself taking home food that isn't perishable (jars of nutella) or that I don't even want and won't use (coconut milk?!?).  Also I took a shit-ton of saran wrap for my windows when it got cold.

POST: So she and I have been together since we were 13, and she moved away a while ago. We have been in a long distance relationship for a while but it has began to fade. She already broke up with me a few months ago, but I managed to win her back. She visits only every few months.

She will be coming back soon, but I find myself attracted to another girl who I have never even spoken to before. My current girlfriend is great but we barely see each other and she says that her love fades everytime she goes back.

We talk every day and she likes all the things I do. I do not know if I am looking for some excuse to end the relationship before her just so I can pursue this other girl (who I have not even talked to yet). So the attraction is superficial to say the least, but I have a deep feeling that if it was not for my morals and conscience, I would have already tried to contact and talk with her. 

I am stuck. I cannot make an objective decision because if I try to justify our fading relationship it feels like an excuse to try and go pursue this other girl. It might be just a passing thing, and I do not know what to do.

TITLE: My (m17) Girlfriend's (f18) of 4 months family is poor... What do I do?

POST: Should I even get involved? My girlfriend comes from a family of two little sisters, mother and father. Her parents are separated, (her father seems fine) but her mother is really poor off... We went to her mother's house today and there was a notice from the water company, saying they owe hundreds and their water will be shut off soon. They have a hard time putting food on the table, but her mother just bought a new car. 

What I'm confused about is whether or not this is an issue of her mother not being able to budget/prioritize properly, or if she just doesnt make enough money...She's a high school teacher and also picks up hours at Home Depot when she can. My girlfriend has a job, and her mother takes nearly all of the money she makes from her bank account without asking. Her mother also seems to be housing a ""boyfriend"", I use that term lightly, because I don't think he adds any income to the house and is mooching; he sleeps there, and when he is not in the house, he has their car. My girlfriend has found marijuana in their car after he's been smoking in it (something no one in that house does). Her mom hasn't commented on this guy's situation yet.

I really worry about the safety of the girls in their house, because their front door doesn't lock and the ""boyfriend"" refuses to talk to the girls or me, which only leads me to believe he's shady. 

Got any ideas as to what I should do? I want to make sure the girls are safe, and I don't want their water shut off. I'm in no position to give them money, and that's not what I want to do, but this situation really is putting stress on our relationship. I'm very ok with her venting about the situation, but I would like some answers or advice to give her. I'm really trying to be a man here, but I don't want to get too involved and take on responsibilities that I can't handle.

TITLE: My friend's [22 M] roommate/brother [19 M] has been stealing from him for weeks, and he doesn't feel safe in his own home.

POST: I'm mainly asking for my friend because a) the parties involved don't use reddit, and b) none of his close friends really know what to do.

**Some background:** A couple months ago, my friend and former roommate (from here on referred to as B) had a call from his mom (who lives several states away) that his younger sister (we'll call her C) had been violent and abusive towards her. She had a history with drugs (meth and heroin) and theft, but her parents were unwilling to just put her out on the street. 

B agreed to take her in for a couple months to get her away from bad influences back home, and things were looking up. C started at a public uni with a clean slate, and B began a new job working long hours to support rent for two. C also began to identify as a male around this time (not sure if that's too relevant). Our friend group was supportive of both of them, and they would come hang out together from time to time.

Several weeks later, B told me privately of C stealing marijuana and prescription painkillers from his (locked) room. I was shocked, because I had thought things were on the upswing judging from the few times I had seen them, but apparently C had failed every single one of his freshman classes. 

C began verbally abusing B and disrespecting (and stealing) his belongings in their apartment and leaving it a mess. B has replaced his locks, but confided in me that he has begun to hate living with C. His lease does not end until the 4th quarter of this year, and I hurts me to know that he works so hard for his sibling and gets treated like this in return.

I've offered to keep some of his valuables at my place away from C, and couch space if he just needs to get away. I just wish that I could do more. How can I help him, reddit?

POST: Dear r/Relationships,
Hey people it seems like whenever i meet a girl or pays attention to me i end up becoming really needy of their attention and in a sense co dependent. I help them with everything no matter. I also never say no and hope that things i give will make people like me. For example, at my job i get a lot of food, which i then usually give away, for 3 reasons. 1. I dont really want it, 2. i want to be nice, and 3. is because i really want people to like me and i think i can get them to do that by giving them food. 

It feels like whenever i make a new friend guy or girl i keep inviting them to places or to come over for dinner, yet they also keep saying no. In my mind i think i am the stereotypical nice guy, and i realize that i just have no idea how to get out of the place and into just the guy.

Thanks

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my ?? [25 F] weeks, - she's moving faster than the Starship Enterprise.

POST: Ok so after breaking up with my partner of 4 years last month, my friends/family encouraged me to get out there, meet folk, be merry. 

I did this, at the suggestion of one of my friends I joined a dating site. I met someone who despite living far away said she often visited my area for work. We had a good time chatting but honestly I just got this real strong friend vibe from it. 

We casually flirted, she was really graphic on what she wanted to do, and like an awkward idiot I just kind of nodded and said ""wow great."" 

We talk everyday and she'd been hinting towards the idea that we were dating (we've never met in person). I don't know why but I was like ok and I went with it. I didn't see a harm in it. Unknown to me, she meant that we were an item, a couple if you will. I thought it meant we were two people seeing if we wanted more. I could handle that. 

Now she's telling me about how her sister has seen me on Facebook, her family and friends know about me, and like I haven't told anyone bar one guy about her and even that was ""Well she's nice but there's no spark."" 

The problem is, and I'm not proud of admitting this, I worry that if I say I just want to be friends I will actually lose the friendship. She is great to talk to, and we have a lot of good conversations but there's just not that spark on my end, she just feels like one of the guys to me. If I'm brutally honest, she's really helping me forget about my ex and while there's nothing romantic there I really could see us being great friends. 

What on earth do I do?

He then leaned over to kiss me and I turned my head to the side and looked down as I felt shy. He then said ""I want to kiss you"" and I kind of shook my head. Later in the night we went to another bar and he tried to kiss me again and I moved my head to the side and he kissed my cheek. Then again as he was leaving he tried to kiss me again and I said ""I'm just shy.... and it's been 3 years"" and he said ""all the more reason to let me kiss you"". We gave each other with a hug and a promise to meet again soon. I let him know when I got home and thanked him for having a lovely time and he replied he should be thanking me and he wants to meet up soon. I wonder if to some I am considered some kind of a tease or something? A friend has said I am giving mixed signals and need to make up my mind what I want.

TITLE: [23f] My [24m] boyfriend of 5 years refuses to help with house work.

POST: Been together more than 5 years. Lived together 4 years. We met online and I moved 9 hours away from home to be with him.

We are currently on the market for a house. I am freaking out. There's so many things wrong with our relationship. And buying a home is such a large commitment. We are doing this because we are sick of renting an apartment that will cost us the same as a house. 

Problems with our relationship: He does zero chores around the house. He can't even feed our dog, or take out the trash. I constantly ask for help, in the nicest way possible, with still no help. It wouldn't be such a problem if I could handle being in a messy home, but I can't. It stresses me out to no end. I can't even sleep well knowing our apartment is dirty.

In his defense he does work A LOT. And his job isn't easy. 

He is a single child and was spoiled his whole life. I am terrified it will never change. Any time I bring up my worries he makes me feel guilty. Explains how he makes ""SO much more money"" than me. That all this house work should be on me. Puts me down for not working more (I already work almost 40 hours a week). I cook dinner for him every day, meals I can't even eat (Pescetarian), keep his home spotless, and I still never receive a ""thank you"".

When my concerns are brought up, and he knows I am close to just giving up and leaving, he will fix his problems. For a week, tops. He will clean up after himself, take out the trash, thank me for dinner. But 7 days pass and he's back to the same old shit. 

Five years may not seem like a lot to some, but it was a lot for me. I sacrificed my family and friends to be here with him. And I would hate to see it all go down the drain. Is there a way to fix this?

TITLE: TIFU by calling my best friend's grandmother a nazi

POST: This FU happened in December of last year, so forgive me, and is possibly one of my worst.

So my very closest friend in the world (let's call him AssHat) loves to troll me. I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall ""My Grandmother went to heaven today."" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.

I type ""Good riddance"" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying ""That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?"" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: ""She was a horrible person and a menace to society"", ""She even ran over my cat and never apologized"", ""I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items."", ""That monster was literally a nazi!"", ""She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.""

I felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.

TL;DR:","  Tried trolling my best friend by spreading lies about his grandmother, turns out she actually passed away that day and I was the worst best friend in the world.

TITLE: Me [27F] with my [29 M] freeloader. Heres a update!

POST: **Original Post**

Wow, was this four months ago? crazy!

Anyway, I took the advice in the comments and stopped replying to Mr. Freeloader. In short I started seeing someone else (that didn't work out but oh well! another liar for another time!) and starting ignoring Freeloaders messages. He became more desperate and would ask to see me. I suffered with a heavy blow of Glandular Fever so used that as an excuse as to why I couldn't come and see him. He made no effort to come and see me.

He launched into a massive rant about how his sheltered housing was now ""dangerous for him to live at"" because someone involved with drugs/witnessed a murder was in there for safety. He whined ""that its not exactly good for me is it? I need to know whats going on! I need to get out of here and have a safe place to stay in don't I?. He knew that my house was free as my parents were away, a massive hint drop if ever I saw one. So I brushed it off and said ""I hope you find somewhere"" as sad as I was for him, I certainly did not want him at mine outstaying his welcome and going through my things, helping himself to food and toiletries. He kept on for a few days and then obviously realised his efforts to see me and his hints were futile. 

So now I haven't heard off him for the past 2 months. No calls, no texts, no Facebook messages. He's very absent on Facebook and last I saw he was moaning about not being able to play Pokemon Go on his ""POS phone"" 

Thank you for the comments guys, I certainly do not associate with him anymore. When I tell people about him I often get back ""yea he's like that. Now you won't help him with money or lodgings he's not interested""

POST: First of all, I'm fairly new to this subreddit so I apologize if this post doesn't look like a normal one. Also, I know some might think say that I shouldn't be in a serious relationship at 16, but hear me out.

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 10 months, and completely love eachother. But, lately we have been fighting ALOT. I think jealousy is a major cause in our problems. We fight over stupid little things, and way too often. Last week, we discussed our issues and both came to the conclusion that we weren't happy, and should possibly take a break. Ok, thats fine. 

Next, is where I need help. 

Before we dated, she had been dating a guy for awhile and she claims that she had in fact been in love with him. Fast forward back to now, he just became single again, and they (my SO and him) have began talking again. They had never really talked while he had a girlfriend (No, I know she was not secretly talking to him). 

She tells me that she (very recently) had talked to him about our relationship problems, and basically getting comfort from him, but she still claims that she has no feelings for him, past being a friend. 

He knows that I absolutely hate him, yet he told my gf ""I dont want to interfere with your relationship with OP"". She even told him that I need to get over the fact that they (Ex and my girlfriend) are friends. 

I really dont know what to do. I love this girl like no other, but I really dont think I could handle the jealousy of them being friends.

Sorry for this being so long.

The thing is, like in real travel, she's given us a budget and my hypothetical expenses are adding up. I only need a one-way flight to my initial city - in this case, Tunis - and I need to include pricing for accommodations. I'm setting the dates for sometime in June, if it's relevant.
I'm under the impression that you'd save some significant money doing a flight + hotel package, but everything I see offered on the websites includes round trips only, as far I can see.

POST: Me and my ex broke up 2.5 months ago, due to her feeling very stressed out due to having so much going on, which made her decide she wasn't ready for a relationship. We had slight contact after that, but 4 weeks ago I went strict no contact to move on. She messaged me 2 weeks into it, cause she was pissed off that I deleted her from social media, but then decided that that's my decision so she'd respect it.

I went straight back to nc until a week later, she messaged me, apologising for being so horrible since the breakup to me, and told me how much she missed me and how upset she was, she said about how showing feelings has never been a strong point for her, so she found it too hard to show them. She told me how sorry she was, and how she wished it worked out differently, and was really hoping that we'd be friends. After this, I told her that maybe things will be different again soon, to which she agreed. She then made the conversation for the rest of the night, which is good, we hadn't had any proper conversation in a long time and it felt good to speak, in fact, we discussed things that got between us towards the end, and it's clear that won't be a problem anymore! we've spoken every day since.

My problem is, I don't know if she's interested still, it seems it, but like I said, she isn't good at expressing feelings, and she's always been quite a blunt texter. I want to arrange dinner somewhere, just a small catch up, and hopefully it'd lead to try working on slowly becoming more than friends again, maybe not however, but as I have no clue on what she feels, I don't know if asking would be a good idea or not! I don't want to ask and make things awkward if she doesn't want to, I'd only be asking for an innocent catch up, so surely I don't know why she'd say no if it were to just be friends, but I'm still very nervous about it.

TITLE: My date [M/28] tried to kick me [21/F] off the bed?

POST: I write this one mainly to chanel my frustration, but also because I'm confused as hell whether this is so inappropriate I should treat it like a major red flag.

I've been on some dates with this guy, and the last couple of times I stayed over at his place. He doesn't have a double-sized bed, only two person-sized beds, so after doing the deed, and falling asleep right next to each other I usually just move over to the other bed (mainly because he starts spazzing and snoring).

This last time we were out drinking, so we came back to his place drunk (me more than him), undressed and got into bed fast. As I said I usually can't stay the night next to him, but thanks to the booze this wasn't a problem now, I slept like a baby. I still woke up once or twice when I felt I was almost falling down the bed, and once when he climbed over me to get to the other bed.

When I wake up in the morning, I look at him on the other bed, and he's there playing with his phone with a really stern look on his face, and giving me the stink eye. I understood I probably did something in my sleep, like snoring or kicking, so I said ""Sorry, did I chase you away? I've been sleeping so deep I wasn't feeling anything if you were poking me or something"", and he answers ""Yeah, I didn't have enough space so I tried kicking you off, but didn't succeed, so I had to move from my *own* bed."" I would think he was kidding, but his tone was really serious, and he was still giving me this cold look. I tried to talk about it, but then he just brushed it off, and sat down to work, ignoring me for maybe another hour (while I was still lying in his bed, I'm horrible!). 

Now everything's alright and peaceful, but what the actual fuck was that? Who does that?

POST: We're both 20, I'm a female, he's a male, we've been dating for a little over a year.

My boyfriend was talking with a couple guys about what he was going to do for his buddy's birthday.  The guys asked if he was going to wingman his buddy, and my boyfriend said ""No, he has a girlfriend!"" and then he smiled and said, ""Well, we'll wingman him anyway!""

I asked him what he meant by that later, and if he just flirts with girls when I'm not around, and he said that it was just guy talk and that his buddy doesn't love his girlfriend like he loves me.  I know that my boyfriend rarely even talks to other girls and I trust him, but that comment rubbed me the wrong way... Should I be worried?

POST: Here is the OP: 

I spoke with an attorney. His legal advice was that we did not have a lease but it would be best to keep this out of court.

I agreed completely. I wanted legal advice before the meeting in case things went pear shaped.

I came to an agreement with the landlord. We are going to pay Jan/Feb and call it a day. 

I always set personal feelings aside when it comes to making decisions for the business I own. My feelings don't matter, I have to do what is best for the business. What was best was settling this matter to ensure that my manufacturing space was not put into jeopardy.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my girlfriend [21F] - LDR for 3.5 years, we've never fought before

POST: Hello /r/relationships! I'm afraid I don't have anything dramatic to entertain you with, just some minor nagging questions I'm looking for some advice on.

Some background: I've been with my girlfriend for a little over 3.5 years. We started dating right before we both left for university about 7 hours apart. Although long distance hasn't been much fun, we do our best to see each other as much as we can during the summer and winter breaks. The relationship is great, minus the distance -- I feel like I love her more and more every day, I've never felt so connected to someone else in my life. Someday down the road, I think I'd like to ask her to marry me.

Here's the thing: it almost seems *too* perfect sometimes, you know? We have never had a fight, not even a small one, and I can't help but worry about it sometimes. It's probably silly, but I don't know if we're just really good at preempting conflict or if we just naturally always get along or if it's a ""calm before the storm"" situation or what. Hopefully, we'll be able to move in together in about a year, and I just wonder if suddenly everything will be different. I mean, it will be, obviously, but what if we're not as good at living together as we are at living apart?

So basically, I'd just like to hear from others who've been in peaceful relationships and/or long-term LDRs and how those turned out when the distance dropped to zero.

TL;DR:","  Been with my girlfriend for 3.5 years, never had a fight before, wondering if we're just really good at avoiding conflict or if we just naturally get along. Looking for other people's experiences.","  Never had a fight with long distance girlfriend, wondering if that means anything worrisome or if I should just be grateful. Also wondering about the transition from being long distance to finally moving in together and how that could potentially change the relationship."

POST: I posted here a couple weeks ago about how I thought my coworker might be interested in me. Turns out that I was right. Just two days ago she went ahead and kissed me. I went along with it because I didn't know what else I could do.

 She told me she doesn't care that I'm younger than her. But I do slightly feel bothered that she's much older. I'm supposed to be meeting her for lunch in a few hours but I also feel hesitant about going. I don't want to hurt her or use her for anything. I don't feel comfortable about starting a relationship with her either since I'm still recovering from a break up that happened a few months back. She's a really good person and there's nothing wrong about her. But I'm not over my ex completely yet. I feel like a horrible person for kissing her back, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings in any way.

I can't end everything with her either, or else it'll be too awkward at work. I just don't know what to do or what to say. What would you guys do in a situation like this?

I didn't check which hour. But it was half past. I panic, call the taxi company and ask for an urgent taxi. Usually when I'm late there is a 15 minute delay. Today is not the case. The taxi is waiting outside my house in 5 minutes. I think this is a little odd given the morning rush but just forget about it in the panic of wanting to get to work on time.

TITLE: On the subject of the circlejerk/elitist dichotomy.

POST: In the past day or so I've come across some rather troubling sights. One of which I saw in r/vinyl, the only sub I tend to visit with due regularity. There, a redditor made a thread to discuss the mastering of an album compared to it's digital counterpart. He was met with a response that it sounded 'funny' because the band sucked. The antagonist to the OP then went on a thorough, but juvenile, nit picking of his distaste for said band. It lead OP to call r/vinyl 'r/elitistmusiccirclejerk'. While the sub can be helpful in discussion of vinyl and listening tips, it's also a place where people share their collections, to the jargon of a good few.

Last night in r/music I was reading comments in a thread wherein OP had up to enough with people posting popular music. Others suggested that he check out various, more specified subs. This was met with people saying that sharing links to other subs leads those of 'inferior' tastes to their smaller subs, ruining them.

The same can be said of just about any sub that deals in pictures. Particularly r/WTF, which 'goes back to it's roots' about once a month instead of people just going to something more suitable. Any sub that hits more than a few thousand subscribers seems doomed to turn in such a way.

I find it disheartening that people feel this way. That some will complain about the content of a sub and others well be upset when alternatives are proposed. Seeing as Reddit is a community based in connection and sharing, with many options available to provide with an acceptable feed, I find the battle between those that circlejerk (post what they like, and know others will) is met with such fierce elitism (a hatred/dislike of those who appreciate similarities, even on a base level).

How do you feel about this? Discuss!

Fast forward to now and I am truly happy.  I love spending time with my current gf, and honestly can see myself spending my life with her.  She feels the same for me.  Everything is for lack of a better word perfect. My issue is that I have this underlying trust issue now due to my experience with my ex.  I have explained the situation to my current, and she is VERY understanding.  She does everything she can to make sure I am comfortable and at ease with situations.

TITLE: What do you use for flea control?

POST: My family has tried literally EVERYTHING to control the fleas in our neighborhood (Frontline, Advantage, Diatomaceous Earth, Dawn Dishsoap, etc!) and nothing has worked. I have spoken to lots of pet owners in my area (I work as a vet assistant) and many are reporting similar results, where fleas are becoming resistant to the usually recommended treatments. The only thing that has worked so far is Comfortis, but I've read of several dogs having reactions to it that can be pretty severe. My dogs are fine, we've used it for about a year now, but I don't like the idea of harming them or putting them at risk. 

Giving them baths with blue Dawn dish soap does kill all the fleas, but it does nothing to prevent more from coming back, obviously. It only kills on contact, and we are NOT going to over bath them because that isn't healthy either. We're looking for something that lasts.

Does anyone else have experience with this, or any detailed information on Comfortis and if it does serious damage to your pet's system? Yes, I know I am a vet assistant. My boss strictly recommends Frontline and literally will not listen to me when I tell him it doesn't work and my dogs are still covered in fleas and we have to use Comfortis because it is the only thing that gives them relief. He is not a resource in this case. 

Just wanted to see what other pet owners (specifically ones in San Diego) do for fleas...the ones we have here are mutants or something, because almost nothing works on them!

TL;DR:",  We've tried every flea control product out there and nothing works. We need something that lasts and is safe for our pets. What do you use for flea control?,  the fleas in our town are becoming resistant to generic flea treatments like frontline; comfortis is the only thing that works but can have serious side effects.

The past two times (around November and 1 week ago) I've stayed at her house and gotten pretty friendly with one of her roommates.

I guess my basic question is, what would be the best way to ""escalate"" the relationship? Of course I would be down for a casual hook-up, but I think even better would be to start an actual relationship, which I don't have much experience with.
   
Tangential question: what are some good ways to flirt via text/snapchat that doesn't come across as weird or over-eager?

Or should I just play it cool and not try any escalation until I visit again?

Let me know if more information is necessary, I'll do my best to provide anything.

Recently a close friend of mine has been going through a tough time and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing to offer support. Most of my friends or family I contact through text or messenger so touching or bringing food or anything of actually being there is out of the picture. Sometimes they are also many miles away. 

I know the classic ""Do you want to talk about it?"" Or ""Just know I'm here for you"" lines but what the heck does that even mean? What usually happens is I say those things, they say something, I say sorry you are feeling that way, then they say something else and I'm stuck for words. I can't just keep saying sorry over and over. There's just so many times I can say ""Oh no.. :("" or ""That's not good.. :/"" I know being supportive and comforting means to listen and be there, but I just find it really difficult when it's all in text and I'm not able to just hold them or just nod and give them my full attention.

TITLE: Needing help with an absent father

POST: I have never had a solid relationship with my father. The relationship I have had is also pretty depressing. I have seen him in person four times and not once in the last 10 years (I'm 19). When I was younger, he would send birthday presents and Christmas gifts, but throughout the years, the letters and gifts stopped coming. Then, the phone calls stopped too. From fourth to ninth grade I was so confused that I did nothing. I was too young to even comprehend what was happening and that it wasn't my fault. In 9th grade, I decided I would give him a call. When I did, we talked for a little while and of course he promised to call more often. However, he never called again. Four years later (my first year in college) I decided to call him. 

I had found out he attended the same school I do now, only to flunk out after 6 weeks. When I called him, we talked for hours and kept in contact over the next couple months. One day he called me crying and saying he was so sorry for everything and he wants so badly to be in my life now. However, that seemed to change when I flew up to Washington to visit him and he stopped answering my calls and never returned any of the calls after I left to go back to school. To be the adult, I sent him a letter explaining I would have a relationship at whatever rate he felt comfortable with and today, I received a response.

He rambled on for SIX pages of writing about absolutely nothing. He even had the nerve to say that the only person who has loved him these last two decades has been his new wife.

We've been talking and snapping constantly for a bit now and he would like to meet up and go out on a date. The thing isss that he actually lives in an apartment a good few hours away. It seems silly to drive so far for a dinner [even a dinner and a movie] and then drive all the way home.  

Soo what do you do in this situation? I would love to stay up there for a night on the couch or whatever and then hang out again the next day. But the possibility of unsafe people is so ingrained that I'm kind of terrified to. Probably for good reason.  

But I get pretty good vibes off this guy. The way he talks, the things he says. I know his full name and address and he doesn't know either of mine. I know he isn't lying about name cause I've seen probably a hundred snaps by now with his name on his uniform. We aren't fb friends but I did stalk him and I liked the things I saw and the things he has on there.

POST: We have been together for 2 years. When we first got together he had never had a proper gf before and mostly slept around. I knew he was a huge fan of porn and in the first few months of the relationship I was fine with it. Once we got to know each other more I was able to express my feelings about his porn watching and he told me I was being insecure and that the girls didn't compare to me. However, I offer him sex or blowjobs every day.

He knows how upset I get and burst into tears when I found out he had searched porn. He told me he doesn't deserve me because I'm ""such a good person"" but to be honest, I don't feel I am because I made him feel this way. I don't ever want to see him like that again and it took me by total surprise. The only reason I get so upset about it is because he knows the names of porn actressess and searches them. This makes it more personal to me. I noticed he has liked the actressess on facebook which really annoys me. I get jealous of him jerking off to Divas in WWE.

I wish I didn't feel this way and I don't want him to feel this way either. If it's what he wants to do then I have no right to stop him. I can't help how I feel about it and it will never go. Sometimes I think I need to find someone who doesn't watch it at all. I love this boy more than anything and he has stopped watching it because he loves me too but I don't feel right about it.

I understand it's common for people of our day and age to jerk off to porn. It upsets me him looking at them. Maybe if it was more random I wouldn't mind so much but he searches for women with massive asses and huge tits. This makes me feel more insecure because I don't have either.

TITLE: My depressed divorced mother [55 F] can't let it go - what can I [27 F] do?

POST: She and my father divorced 3 years ago under (relatively) amicable terms.  He was married again within 1-2 years.  They speak very rarely.

The issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.  She's relatively functional in her professional life, but she's made it clear she misses having someone to talk to the way that she talked to my dad (both are very smart people, and she has a hard time getting that with her friendships and colleagues).  She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.  Not to mention that exuding unhappiness makes you a pretty dull date!

I'm worried because I'm moving to a different state soon and I want her to be on an upswing before I leave.  She's halfheartedly tried therapy and stays on antidepressants for a while but it never seems to go anywhere.  I think the bottom line is that she's unhappy, has low self worth, and is exceedingly picky about men.  What can I do to move her in the right direction?  I know that this has to come from within, but it's driving me insane watching her wallow in sadness.  I want to be sensitive but it seems so obvious she just needs to toughen up, put herself out there, and realize that she deserves happiness!

TITLE: I [24 F]have a [24 F] roommate with anxiety, what have I gotten into? How do I fix it?

POST: Backstory, I am moving out for the first time, spent some time home saving up money and all that good stuff. I've never had a roommate. I have no idea what this all entails, but I assume(d) that the general rules of relationships would apply. My Roommate is a friend(yes, I know...""she won't be your friend after living together"") However, her anxiety and personal issues have resulted in some issues....

    Having my boyfriend over, for example. We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room. I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month. She also does not want my friends over, ever.

    I originally had plans to move in on Thursday/Friday, however due to last minute plans, I had to switch to Friday/Sunday. This resulted in us being there together Sunday. I was met with stomping everywhere she went and silence to any questions I asked....She is now saying that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.

TITLE: How do I [23F] stop feeling nostalgic and sad whenever I see reminders of my ex [24M], who was my first?

POST: We dated for 4 years and were FWB for about a year and a half afterwards. We were each other's firsts for almost everything. I've recently started seeing a new guy [20M] and I really think it has potential to go somewhere. Unfortunately, my ex also recently told me that he has started to have feelings for me again (after I essentially ""waited"" for him for a long time). I didn't have the same feelings back so I went no-contact with him yesterday. 

Today, I saw that he had blocked me on FB and probably everywhere else. It instantly solidified what was happening and I felt a pang of nostalgia. When will this go away, if ever? He has been in almost half my life and a quarter of them essentially with him. Realistically, I know it's going to be hard to get over your first love and that I will occasionally have these nostalgic and sad thoughts ... but what things can I do to show my new man that he is the one for me?

TITLE: Dear Reddit, superglued my wedding ring to my foot. Need help.

POST: If you're married, you'll understand.

I was attempting to fix part of the bathroom mirror.  My wife, whom I love very much, heckled me a bit and joked about how I'd glue my hands together.  I don't want to give her the satisfaction of being right (as she always is).  Esp. when it comes to my abilities as a handyman.

Long story short, while opening the superglue bottle, I poked the front and squeezed and it shot out and nailed my hand, ankle and foot. I was trying to reduce the damage and took off my ring and proceeded to try to wipe away the mess. Next thing I know, the ring is glued to my foot pretty darn good.  I tried to pull it off but it broke skin and caused a bit of bleeding. I just want to get this off before she comes back.  Need a way to dissolve the glue safely ASAP.

TITLE: I [24m] having existential stress regarding my girlfriend of 8 months [20f].

POST: So my gf and I have, for the most part, been doing great. We've said the ""i love you""s and have awesome times together.

My main problem is that she is very independent and it leaves me feeling uncared for. For example, today we had lunch plans. I texted her a reminder and she said she already ate because she was hungry but that i could meet her at the library to hang out a bit. I feel fed up because many times she has set up a date only to cancel it or change it without seeming to think of me. 

I believe she isnt doing it purposefully and is just self focused. Still, i feel like im constantly stressed about our relationship and cant get a good read on what she is feeling. I want to get through to her but when i try to talk about our relarionship i just feel like im spoiling the mood. My question is: should i just accept this as part of her? Or is it worth fighting about? I consistently feel neglected but i know she loves me. Maybe im just too emotionally dependent.

POST: About 2 years ago I took up homebrewing as a hobby and recently I've been thinking about giving my operation a name and investigate possibly going pro a few years down the road if everything goes well. 

I recently thought of a name I love, but a short Google search shows that some homebrewer has already used the brewery name on untappd.com and brewshuttle.com. It appears that the only person interacting with him/her are friends and family. Neither account has been used in at least 12 months.

TITLE: I [18/F] am in a very weird relationship with my friend [18/M] right now...

POST: Me and him started out as friends, then it became a little bit more.

A bit of background information about myself. I do not want to enter into romantic relationships, ever. I want to remain friends with him, and that is my final resolve. However, at my age, of course, I want to have sex.

Last night was the first time we ""slept"" together. No, we did not have sex; we simply slept in the same bed while hugging each other I suppose. Yes, why indeed did I allow this to happen if I want to remain friends with him... Well to be truthful, the whole time, my mind was on sex. I wanted him to touch me. The problem is, I feel like he wants more than a casual ""friends with benefit"" relationship. He was extremely careful not to touch me unless I implied that it was ok. I don't believe I have actual romantic feelings for him because my genitalia seems to be the only thing dictating my actions.

Baseline is, I want to remain friends with my male friend but my hormones are leading him on. I want to have sex, but he thinks otherwise.

What the fuck do I do.

TITLE: Am I (F22) an asshole for dating my ex's (24m) kind of best friend (22m)?

POST: So I broke up with my ex a month ago, relationship was 10 months. Was absolutely amazing, we were so compatible and my silly fantasies actually made me really believe he was the one (still feel that way). But there was a pretty major dealbreaker that I couldn't overlook (not relevant) and we split up. Tried to be friends but currently not talking (my idea) because I thought we needed space from each other to get over the break up. With the expectation that we'd try to be friends again in the future. 

Enter mutual friend who has been there for both of us throughout this whole break up. My ex and I both tell him everything, both vent to him, etc. He's our go to when we need to talk to someone. I met him before I met my ex but this friend, John, was friends with my ex longer than with me (we all worked together). So two completely independent friendships. Anyway on to the issue....

John has really been making some moves lately and one day while we were smoking he just kissed me. John told me there was no way he was telling my ex and assured me that this would only be strictly casual (which I'm okay with).

I guess my question here is am I a terrible person for not telling my ex? Or for even considering this with John? I just can't help but think that I don't want to hurt my ex at all and I know he would be if he finds out that the guy he confides in about us and his loneliness is hooking up with his ex. I still love him more than anything so I guess I already know the answer but I could still use the input.

TL;DR:",  Ex's best friend kissed me while we were broken up. Says it's strictly casual. Am I an asshole for not telling my ex? Or for even considering this with this guy?,  Mutual friend with ex wants to date casually without ex knowing. Should I tell him? Or tell John to tell him? Or should I not even consider this?

TITLE: my (25f) Dad (48m) is having a baby with a girl two years younger than me (23f obviously) and I am just broken hearted over if. I can't lose him but I can't forgive him either.

POST: So as short as I can make it, I've always been super close with my Dad. My mom was clinically crazy and we were both the victims of her abuse until she finally took off and left us when I was 13. I've always felt that it's been he and I against the world. 

When I got home for 4th of July I knew he was nervous and avoiding something important. And then bam out of the blue a young girl shows up at the house and she's his girlfriend. Yay!! Oh and not only that they've been dating since January and the cherry of everything...she's due in October. 

Once my dad relaxed and I caught my breath and the week settled in (my dad was very respectful of my opinion and pre-arranged for her to stay with her family---who apparently approve of this situation) I could tell he was very happy and excited, in fact more so than I'd seen him in years. When I discussed the details he said that she worked as an intern at one of his suppliers and thier age difference actually gave them something to talk about as opposed to it being an obstacle. She's in college, she comes from a good family and she's made it clear that prior to them getting marrried, we all meet with a lawyer so my dad's estate is fair to all of us. So at least by her word she's a decent person who is not after my Dads money.

All of this would be awesome if she were 45, 40 or even 35...but she's 23. And it just seems weird. And it makes me sad and it makes me feel like I'm losing him. I'm having a hard time forgiving him for taking ""him"" away from me. 

I would LOVE any help.

TITLE: TIFU by spraying insect repellent on my hat.

POST: This happened a couple of months ago, when it was still reasonably warm here in Alaska. Up here, the state bird is the mosquito, they are vicious and come in unrelenting waves. One can only protect themselves with copious amounts of bug-dope.

So we were out camping and I was fed up with all of the bugs still biting my face during the night, and I had a wonderful idea to drench my fleece cap in bug spray to hopefully stave them off. I proceeded to get into my sleeping bag and pull my fleece cap over my eyes to block the sun. 

Fast forward to the morning. I wake up feeling wonderful, I just need to rub the sleep out of my eyes. So I give my sockets a good palm rub and stretch my back a little. Upon opening my eyes again, I still cannot see anything, it's like I'm looking through the plastic sheeting into one of Dexter's kill rooms. I start to panic and rub my eyes frantically, only to make it worse because now it hurts and I can't see. So I ran over to our water container and dosed my face with water for a while, it didn't help much, but I started regaining my vision slowly.  

It took about 3 hours butIt has returned to normal, needless to say, I have learned a valuable lesson.

We wanted to focus on getting to know each other first. 

I'm not a very needy gf, he lives maybe like 12 miles away but has a wonky work schedule so I really only get to see him 1-2 a week, and I'm okay with that because hey...that's life and I really like him. My friends know this and think it's weird that he hasn't introduced me yet to his family, considering he uses the 'L' word and has talked about his future with me in a pretty serious manner.

TITLE: How can I (30) tell my husband (29) that I'm no longer attracted to him and I'm not satisfied sexually?

POST: He's always been a big guy, and when we first started dating it wasn't really an issue. I was so in love and blind to all of his physical characteristics that his size didn't bother me. We've been married now for 6 years and the blinders have come off a bit. I still love him a great deal but I'm just not attracted to him anymore. He doesn't take care of himself. He doesn't shower enough, dresses like a hobo and eats like crap. I get kind of disgusted by him and I feel awful about it because I really do love the person he is on the inside. 

What's bothering me most is our sex life. I'm horny all the time, just not for him, and I'm starting to notice other men and that scares me. I want to be attracted to him and do all the kinky stuff I have in my head but I look at him and am so turned off. That, and his size makes sex very difficult so we've resorted to just using our hands and oral. It is so unsatisfying. 

He is a *very* sensitive guy and I'm understanding of it and I don't want to hurt him but something has to change. He's noticed a difference in me and my lack of affection/desire but when he asks me about it I just blame it on something else. I have talked with him before about how sexy it'd be if he got in shape a little. I told him we could start eating right/working out together. I try to be as compassionate as possible but he either gets horribly offended and withdrawals from me or exercises for a day and then goes back to his old ways. 

What can I do? It's getting serious and I don't know how much longer I can be with a person that I find so repulsive. I know everyone will tell me to just be blunt and tell him how I feel, but it's not that easy. He's had a rough life that I won't get into (unless someone is interested of course) and i can't hurt his feelings like that. I just can't.

How can I tell him I'm no longer interested?,  my husband's weight/appearance/hygiene is turning me off and I'm finding myself looking at other men and i don't know how to talk to him about it effectively without hurting him.

POST: We've had a very rocky past 4 or 5 months, and have been very off and on. But about 3 weeks ago she flipped her car, and walked away. But it really made me reconsider everything about her. And now I understand how devastated I would be if I lost her.

First:
I am a college student and I go to school in New York so there are TONS of high quality guys around. I've used Tinder and other social apps to meet guys online. The only thing I am worried about is that I don't know if a guy is truly single or not! I like dating guys older than me and I am afraid they will have a gf, or even married! I always tried to look them up on FB before talking to them, but most of them does not put their relationship. I will never be the third wheel in a relationship (it's who I am and I cannot forgive myself if I become one) and I hate dramas with other girls but I've encountered guys who have girlfriends who are chatting girls up online! If you have experience with dating online, can you give me some advice on how to avoid this?

Second:
I've met this awesome guy and we have chatted nicely and everything for a couple of days. The chemistry is definitely quite strong with this one, except he is incredibly good looking and seems to be out of my standards (I found his FB). He haven't seen my picture yet, but I am really not the attractive type. He have all the qualities girls are looking for: good looks, good education and steady job out of college. I have a feeling he's been talking to other girls too, and I know for sure those girls are better looking than I am. I am really insecure about meeting up and have been avoiding it. I know all guys weight attractiveness very importantly...and I know I don't meet up to those standards. Our chemistry is awesome, but I don't think that is enough if he's not attracted to me....what should I do? Will the chemistry weight out the other factors...maybe?

TITLE: New bf [27M] not helpful with my [27F] family

POST: We were out on a date which had to be cut short because my dad was not feeling  well. My mom asked that I come back home and send him to the hospital. We're barely two months in this relationship but my mom roughly knows that I have a bf. I asked if he could help... Help to support dad walking to the car and sending us to hospital. Kinda shocked when he said no. It seems more like nervous over meeting the family more than anything :( and maybe because we're still relatively new. He said he would meet my family soon but in better circumstances. However, if you could help, shouldn't you help? 
There's also a few other instances where I felt he could help, but he doesn't seem to want to. Im not sure whether this is just cause we're new or should I be worried? He's perfect in every other way though.

TL;DR:",  New bf doesn't help with sending dad to hospital after date. Seems more nervous over meeting the family more than anything. Should I be worried?,"  New bf. Family had an emergency. Expected him to help, but he did not want to because he was nervous. "

TITLE: I [22/M] haven't had many relationships need advice on how to make and progress a healthy one

POST: Ok so to start here's a brief synopsis of my past relationships: 

my first official one was about a year ago she [20/F] (I was 21 at the time) was shy and lived in the next state over, and didn't have a car but worked with me to find good times to meet and I made an effort to visit her regularly. It was both our first real relationship so things didn't go very far in the physical department. when the fall semester started we were able to meet more frequently and I though things had been going well but suddenly it ended with her saying that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me after some introspection on her part. I reacted badly and too emotionally (crying and asking why, similar bs) mostly due that being my first real breakup. 

My second relationship went better [21/f], we hung out a bit during summer (we lived closer and met more often and played some online games frequently) and got comfortable being close to one another but when college started back up I barely saw her. I tried every other week to set aside time for us but she consistently replied that she was too busy with work and school, I told her we could meet any time I wasn't in class but she rarely (once in 2 months) worked with me to find a good time. At this point I became rather dejected but kept it to myself and felt like she either didn't really like me and just wasn't telling me or I had done something wrong, but she said I hadn't done anything. So after a few weeks and only texting, with her changing the subject every time I tried to tell her how I was feeling and going out of my way to make time for us even if it was minimal and non romantic I broke up with her by basically saying that if she couldn't put any more effort into the relationship than she already was that we should just be friends. I was mad at her but I kept it to myself.

I feel I should also say that I'm a high functioning autistic (NLD/NVLD) who has adapted well but still has a lot of trouble interpreting body language and nonverbal cues.

TL;DR:",  After a bad breakup I decided to end things with my GF of 1.5 years saying that if she couldn't put any more effort into the relationship than she already was that we should just be friends.,"  I want a healthy relationship but am unsure how to best progress to that point, my previous relationships did not get to the point where we were emotionally or physically comfortable with one another."

TITLE: My [19F] boyfriend [19M] gets really upset over homework and I want to know how to handle it.

POST: Carl and I have been dating for four months now. I love him a lot and he loves me a lot. I think he wants me to he around for a long time and I feel the same way. 

The only issue with our relationship is school. He's taking a really tough class that just doesn't click with him. Normally you'd think this wouldn't be an issue, but it is. 

Whenever he's doing homework for this class, he gets really depressed and angry that he can't figure out the problems. Starts saying things like ""I hate myself"" and ""You should just kill me"". 

As someone who has gone through depression, I see some symptoms in him and really wish he would see a counselor. I suggested it to him, but he said he could handle it himself and I'm not going to give him an ultimatum because I know that those aren't healthy. This is the only time he acts that way. He's almost always happier in person.

I feel like he's upset because he feels inadequate because he can't do this class. He's not happy with his major. He's looking into other lines of work, but for now he's stuck in this class. 

I have no idea what to say to him when he gets like this. Humor doesn't work. Telling him that's it's going to be okay doesn't work. Telling him that everyone still loves him regardless doesn't work. He's tried tutoring, talking to the professor, anything. None of it has worked. I get sad whenever he talks this way, and being cheerful and upbeat about it takes energy. I've tried asking him what I should do in these situations, but he doesn't know. I'm a psych major and I don't know the first thing about the topic he's studying.

I want to be as supportive as I can, but I'm at a loss here.

TITLE: Me [25M] with my girlfriend [25F] 1yr, fucked up by talking to someone I shouldn't have. Need to rebuild trust

POST: I've been dating my gf for a year. we've lived together since September.

From mid-October to end of November, we were in a really rough patch where we were both working our asses off. She had family things happening at the same time, and it all came together in a perfect storm that took itself out on our relationship.

Unfortunately, her stress was often vented onto me so I felt pretty inadequate. Our sex life suffered, I felt like I was turning into a really horrible boyfriend when I wasn't really, and I was feeling pushed away. Angry and in need of some kind of positive attention, I turned to a friend living overseas who I had had an on/off casual relationship with for 2 years, which ended 1 yr before I started my current relationship. I initiated and we sent messages back and forth here and there for approximately 3 weeks. They were long messages, sometimes lightly flirtatious, which is what I was looking for. After a week or so I knew I was wrong to have started it but I was enjoying catching up with a friend--which is what it had become.

The friend was home for Christmas and we both suggested meeting. I downgraded from a drink because i thought it would be inappropriate, and if we had actually decided to have lunch I would have asked my girlfriend's permission and finally spilled the beans on what I had done, kiboshing the entire thing if she said I should. 

Instead, she caught me red handed. We talked things through after i had a sleepless night on the couch and we are staying together, despite what she feels is emotional cheating. I love my girlfriend to the moon and back and this was a major mistake. Obviously rebuilding trust is a long process, but any advice on small acts or suggestions for things I need to keep in mind would be welcome.

TL;DR:","  Talked to a friend overseas for 3 weeks, it escalated to something more, girlfriend caught me red handed and we are staying together despite what she feels is emotional cheating.

It made me extremely sad and i had problem sleeping and just functioning overall. This is probably kinda common for people after breakups, but i took it really hard. Worst part was i had to spend last year in high school together because we went to same class.

But with both girls it just changed overnight, without any reason, and i just felt i needed to end it before it went any longer.

TITLE: Choosing between ~120 dollars from ""student aid"" or a profitable job (swe)

POST: So the situation is as follows:

I am an 18 year old living in Sweden. I am in my last year of high school level studies and I am graduating in June. I work as a private tutor 2 times a week, making me about 150% more after taxes than the government aid given to students here. Due to a change of teachers, my school schedule now overlaps with my most profitable client, with one lesson. 

The lesson is a one hour session in Religious studies, with one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Basically, all the information we get is from the book and is nothing more than what I was taught in elementary school. So I could easily ""catch up"" from that lesson myself at home. 

If I would choose to skip the lesson for work, I would loose my students aid. Here, I can get ~120 dollars every month, if my attendance is high enough and I have legitimate reasons for being absent. Illness is approved absence, working is not. 

My client has already a really tight schedule themselves and cannot move their weekly session with me. Most likely, my school will not allow me to skip one lesson a week, no matter what. I will most likely have to choose between my student aid or my client.

My parents are strongly against the idea of me intentionally missing out on my student aid. They think that it will encourage me to skip even more classes and that it is extremely immoral to not prioritize school when ""high school is my full time job"". I do not have their support if I choose to work. I still live at home and will probably do so for another 4-5 years because of university studies. My relationship with my parents is already frosty and I got the job from the beginning in an attempt to be a little more independent. The money in question is purely my own pocket money so nobody is relying on it to put food on the table.

I really do not know what to do at this point. Any proper adult who can talk me in to what the right decision is?

TITLE: Am I being too picky? Internet dating question...

I'll come right out and say that I'm attractive and in good shape, so I got quite a few responses within the first few days of being on the site. I briefly chatted/emailed with a few guys with the intention to meet up soon, as I didn't join to become someone's online pen pal. In their photos, all of the guys seemed relatively attractive, but when I met up with them in person, not so much. Out of the 3 I've met up with so far, maybe one of them I could see myself being physically attracted to if I get to know him better. The other 2 were so nice, but there's no physical attraction on my end. There's nothing wrong with them, per se, they just look different (and not as good) in real life than they did in their pictures. A little softer and rounder, too. They're all definitely attracted to me. I've always thought of physical attraction as a main motivator for a romantic relationship, but these experiences have left me feeling very superficial and weird.

A year and a half ago my old car died and I need to get a new car... like an idiot I decided to see if I can buy new instead of used.

Because of my bad credit I got a terrible APR on the thing and made the deal anyway... because I had it in my head that I wanted a new car. So for 60 months I'm paying $574 per month on this car - I can afford it, but it's at the point where with everything I make enough to pay my bills and not really a lot of room to put much money at all away in savings.

As of right now I have 42 payments left on the car. I added everything up and it basically means so far I have been paying for the interest on this car loan and still owe more than what the car was even worth new. The car is a 2009 Kia Sportage that I bought for around $22,000 with an APR that was around 20%.

I'd like to get to the point where I can easily pay $250-300 per month if possible.

What should I do? Can I refinance it successfully? Should I look into trading off the car and trying to get a used one? If I refinance is there any recommendations on how to do that process?

TITLE: Boyfriend trouble (20F) (24M)

POST: Boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now. He has suffered from depression for a few years now and when I first met him he was suffering from a (one-off according to doctors) psychotic break that consisted of grandiose delusions. He went to a hospital and stayed til he was better (2 weeks). We have a quiet, boring relationship, hardly any sex due to his low sex drive, but thats okay. I still adore him.

I give alot more than he gives in the relationship but I consider it worth it because I love him alot. He was also horrible at communication during our relationships. Not many calls or texts but we never went over a week without speaking.

2 weeks ago, during (and what still is) a very stressful time for me (end of uni, court cases, birthday, moving out of home) he stopped talking to me. After a week I called his parents whom I was in contact with due to his mental illnesses, and was told he flew to Sydney with his father. He sent me 1 text joking he might get me a present. According to his parents, he got back 2 days later. I didnt hear from him again for another week. I figured this was his cowardly way of breaking up with me. 

I admit I may have gone a little text crazy but after deciding he has dumped me, I sent one last ""I'm sorry, I wont text or call again"" text. 2 days later he messaged me saying "":'( I'm so sorry. I know I'm horrible, I can't stop crying"", I left it a few hours, and texted back that it didnt really clarify anything for me as to whether we are still together.

He still hasnt messaged me yet and I'm unsure what to do or what he is meaning. Is he crying and feeling bad because he loves me or because hes dumping me? Regardless, I just would like to know.

TITLE: What could explain my difficulties with women??

POST: 23 m

I'm not socially awkward, but I am fairly introverted. It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. 

Here's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable / anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.

My luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.

Every women I've been with or been ""talking"" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol. Gay guys always find me one way or another, it happens all the time ha.

Also, my field of study has an inherent lack of women. That probably has a lot to do with the lack of women in my life in general. 

So, what could the problem be??

TL;DR:","  I'm introverted and have trouble talking to women. Even when I try to hold a conversation, women usually don't contribute.

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. No matter how much I tapped the screen the volume button wouldn't come up. So my girlfriend wakes up to this weird, loud Japanese music fucking pissed. 

No amount of sorries could stop the glare she gave me.

And now I'm sitting here typing this for you with no snuggles to be had.

TITLE: How many dates exactly before you need to call someone to tell them you're not interested in seeing them anymore?

POST: That's it really. Went on 3 dates with a girl. Was really 2 too many but she was very eager to see me again, came to my part of town from across the city for the 2nd and 3rd dates, all happened over the course of a month. 

She was persistently texting me (many many texts per day), and she wanted to see me for another date. I finally texted her that I didn't think we should see each other romantically anymore. 

She lost it. Probably 20 - 25 very angry texts, said I should have called her. Said I wasn't ""man enough"" to do it. Meanwhile I was at work and busy, not that I thought this warranted a call anyway. I've dated girls for 2/3 months who ""ended it"" over text, and never thought it was a big deal.

POST: Background: We've been in an on/off relationship since he first broke up with me early this year. He suggested that we try a LDR the day before he moved across the country. Now it's a month later, and I flew to this town to visit him (he paid for the tickets 2 weeks ago).

Problem: I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon, but he's still preoccupied with work. He's also emotionally distant (no physical contact at all, not even sitting closely together) and we hardly talk to each other. The only time I feel close to him is when we have sex, because he'll initiate by being more romantic. He also introduced me as his ""friend"".

TITLE: TIFU by leaving a conference call on while I went to pick up my wife. (NSFW)

POST: Around 4 months ago I put in for PTO time so I could take my wife and son on vacation. After making all my arrangements my boss came up and asked if I could reschedule my vacation because there was a very important meeting the week I scheduled my vacation. I told him I couldn't really reschedule anything and finally we settled with me being on a webcam/conference call type deal for the meeting. 

I agreed and went on vacation, well come time for the meeting I set up my laptop in the hotel room. The meeting was fairly early in the morning so I woke up and I dropped my wife off at some tourist trap she wanted to see. The place she was going wasn't for kids so my son stayed and slept. I came back to the hotel and the meeting started. The meeting went well for the most part.

1 hour into the meeting my wife called and needed picked up. I told my boss I had to go get my wife id be back in 20 minutes. So I left to go get my wife, I left my son in the hotel and told him id be back in 20 minutes. I screen locked the laptop, I didn't know they could still see and hear everything with the laptop locked but they could. Long story short after I left my 13 year old son decided it would be a good time to jerk off, so he did. In front of my boss and about 20+ other employees on the conference call. They seemed to be OK about the whole situation and I wasn't fired. Still however the most embarrassing thing ever.

I'm on my school's cross country team and we're at this meet which generally has a pretty large turnout (it's a yearly event). One of the other teams has a uniform which is characterized with a ton of K's covering a black and white checkerboard pattern (the team name begins with a K). So, with my friends and I being the high schoolers we are, we decide to nickname this team the KKK. The meet has gone on for a couple hours now and we're still waiting for our race to start. So to pass the time we're cheering our teammates on. In the very final 100m of the race, one of our team members (who is black) is about to be passed by none other than a member of ""team K."" In a moment of excitement I yelled ""Come on [X], don't let the KKK beat you!"" I immediately realized what I had said and my coach gave me a stern talking to and said if anything else happened there would be an open spot on the team.

TITLE: Is it possible that my brain cannot learn grammar?

POST: All my life I have struggled with grammar and was wondering whether it is possible to be gramar-disability or something similar.

I speak four languages because we moved a lot when I was a kid. I picked all of them up by ear. However, it was very hard for me to pick up a language in a classroom setting (three years of French and I can barely string together a sentence without errors). I also bend and break grammatical rules in all the languages I speak, and don't have much of an ear for correct and proper sentence structure. I don't speak any of language perfectly.

I ended up studying Indology, a subject that I love. Though the literature, philosophy etc is very easy for me, grammar is my huge stumbling block. I have a feeling that I have been learning the same basic grammar for years and still haven't got the hang of it. I keep on messing up even the very basics. (The language I study is a dead one, so I can't learn it by interacting with locals). Without the grammar I am unable to read texts independently, and this basically rules out any future job in the field.

So I was wondering whether it is possible that my brain is lacking something? Is it possible to be gramatically-challenged? (I am also mathematically challenged and even have problems with basic division). Anyone else have the same problem? Or am I just doing something wrong? Is there a better and more efficient way to learn grammar?

TITLE: I [F21] have a crush on my superior at work [M25]. Halp.

POST: So I recently started interning at a new place and really hit it off with the guy who is one of my two direct supervisors. By ""hit it off"" I mean that when we're not busy, we're usually talking on gchat, he says things like ""You're the best intern ever"" and ""I don't know how I got so lucky to have you as my intern,"" we went out for drinks with a couple other coworkers today and he bought my beer, and he really seems to like my ideas and work. When I was walking into our office building today he ran up behind me and sort of poked me to scare me. That sort of thing. Nothing super flirtatious, but we're more like pals than super professional, stiff coworkers. And I know he's single, too, so there's that.

The thing is, this is a really small office and I want to parlay this internship potentially into a real job. Socializing after hours isn't frowned upon at all (my other supervisor and I just went to a concert a couple weeks ago, but we were friends before I got this job), but I have a feeling dating would be.

        When I brought him home he immediately hid underneath my bed but I won his trust with some bread crusts and after that he's been my shadow. This dog follows me EVERYWHERE (besides the bathroom, he hates baths). If I go upstairs, he goes upstairs. If I sit on the couch, he sits on the couch. 
    Problem is, I've been dating my boyfriend for soon to be 3 years and have lived with him since November. My other dog loves him but my boy Haku doesn't really trust him or anyone. He won't sit in his lap or next to him and won't run or play with him. He only wants to be with me. I know it's gotta be frustrating for my boyfriend because he does try to bond with Haku but Haku doesn't really let him. Haku has become less afraid of him but still won't do much with him.

If he tries to run with Haku with him leashed, Haku will whine and look back and be miserable.

POST: My sister and I both live at home. I just graduated college and I move out again to a different city in August. Hopefully this move will be forever. 

My sister's boyfriend is twenty years older than her. He does not have a home (he bounces around between his parents, his sister, and our house). He has been divorced twice, and has three children between the two marriages (whom he has very little custody of -- it's an every other weekend situation). He's a chain smoker.

*Background info* :
I'm in a long distance relationship with my SO for about 8 months now. I live in the Netherlands, she in Australia. Given the fact I am a typical student, I only have words in my arsenal. 

I've visited her and her parents in April and I must say that I've never met such a wonderful caring family as hers. I'm not 100% of the details, but I beleve the dad has a kidney transplant with the mother as donor, leaving my SO as a carer. 

Problem with this surgery is there could be several outcomes. They could open him up, say ,,no we can't do it'' and he can be on dialysis everyday for the rest of his life. They could do the transplant and the body could not accept the new kidney anyway, it could work or he could lose his legs or he could die. 

*Current situation:*
We spoke today and she refused to be positive. She said that she is trying to be positive but it's not as positive as it sounds. She is very scared and has trouble sleeping, and messages me at night because of that. She tries to find comfort through talking but I do know not what to say and I end up talking about paying back the money I owed her.. stupid >.<

We were really close throughout middle school, high school and afterward (been friends nearly 10 years) but had a bit of a falling out when she made plans to move countries to be with her BF at the time. 

We basically had a fight about her going. I wanted to rent a place together, I told her about it plenty of times and even tried helping her find work to pay for her half. 

One day she told me that she suddenly had plans to go be with some guy on the internet that lived overseas, she was leaving the following month. I told her it was a bad idea and she should just stay and get a place with me like we talked about before. She then told me I was a bad friend for trying to keep her from pursuing her BF. We stopped talking, she dropped all contact with me and that was it. 

Time went on; I went through my old high school things at my parent's place and got a bit emotional looking at old photos of the two of us with our other friends.

I can not invite either but I am sure they will hear about it through the grapevine or someone will post something on social media, and I don't want to have to lie to them because I like them.

Tell her that this guy sucks: we are co workers and I don't want to make that awkward. Also, all of her other friends have already told him he sucks and she has been hard headed about it.

It was one of my friend's birthdays so we gathered at his house and cracked a few beers.  All was going well so we decided to move the small celebration to the front porch considering the refreshing warm weather.

The streets were fairly bustling in the college neighborhood and people in general just seemed grateful to be experiencing spring.  Cars were coming and going, women were rollerblading and men were long boarding.  What an enjoyable day so far!

It was beginning to get dark out but the temperature was still favorable.  Across the street and in between 2 cars was a curb sewer, kind of like [this] .  I had been looking in that direction for whatever reason when I witnessed the biggest raccoon I have ever seen crawl out of the sewer.  I initially thought it was an average-sized house dog.  It was HUGE compared to any other raccoon I had seen before.

""HOLY SHIT! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT COON!"" I was so impressed by this thing's presence.  When my friends also spotted it, their reaction was nearly identical.  We were all standing at this point, laughing and pointing toward the sewer, screaming about the size of the damn raccoon.

The car that was parked right behind the sewer turned on.  It took us by surprise as I guess we weren't expecting anybody to be in it for whatever reason, probably because we were intoxicated and didn't notice it when it originally arrived.

The driver, who never saw the raccoon, rolled his window down as he passed the porch to reveal himself.  He was a large black man with his middle finger up, screaming ""FUCK YOU, YOU RACIST MOTHERFUCKERS!"".  From his perspective, a porch full of young white men suddenly noticed him and then stood up to shout absurd racial slurs at him.

TITLE: Those awful hamstrings (advice needed!)

POST: I know there are some older posts on here about tight hamstrings and running but they didn't quite apply to my situation.

Basically, the past week to two weeks i have significantly (basically, restarted for more than 15/20minutes) running and other various exercises (squats and abs almost exclusively), ans specifically, the past three days really been working at it.  Yesterday when I woke up bilaterally both hamstrings weretight, but i was able to just sit and stretch hands to toes for 5 minutes and they were fine.  sore but fine.  This morning i woke up and literally fell because my legs woulnd't support the weight.  they are still very tender now and it takes me around 5 minutes of straight walking to walk without limping.  i've been drinking plenty of water to increase my BMR but i am at a loss to really specifically what to do.

TITLE: I [23 M] like someone [22 F] who is in a relationship, what the heck should I do now?

POST: Good afternoon, everyone. I have a question for you all and I was hoping that I could possibly get some closure and advice on the subject at hand. 

As such, allow me to set the mood. I met ""Sabree"" during my psych class last semester and at that time, I was not looking to date anyone or get into that scene you know? However, once I found out that she works fairly close to my place of employment and naturally, I decided to speak with her just cause. 

Nonetheless, after a period where I jumped back into the dating scene and failed, I saw her working at her job two Sundays ago and made a very difficult decision. And that was to ask her out for some coffee on Friday and get those digits. However, I had to catch myself because of how nervous I would be. 

As such, after a brief period I finished the mission and boom, got the digits! Excellent, right? 

Nevertheless, we started to speak and then on Wednesday the bombshell dropped! Originally, we going to reschedule the ""date"" for a later date and she told me the following word by word, ""Sorry! I would try to make it back from Eastern on Friday but I wanted to visit my boyfriend"" 

Rats, not this again, you know? Nonetheless, she did in fact make it back just in time for us to chill at Starbucks which was her first time there allegedly so I felt pretty cool about that with me stealing a moment away from ole' boy plus giving her the prequel trilogy of Star Wars to watch over so perhaps down the line, I can watch the OT with her. 

Nonetheless, the point of this question is what the heck should I do going forward? Move on which I plan to do as soon as I can lock in on a few potential women to date or should I continue on and plant the seeds with a slow burning method?

TL;DR:","  Like a girl who works near my workplace, she admitted that she is seeing someone else and I'm unsure of what to do going forward. Should I continue to pursue her or move on?","  got a girl's number, found out that she is taken but we went out last Friday, what's the plan of action from here?"

TITLE: I think my family is being stalked

POST: I'll try to make this as short as possible. For the last few months about 330-4 in the morning my wife and I have heard a car drive by. It has an after market muffler so it's very loud and can be heard in our room (which is on the opposite side of the street.) In September she had our baby so that is when I would occasionally hear it while feeding the baby in the middle of the night. I had just assumed whoever this was, was going to work, but the other night my wife was feeding the baby and saw the guy stop at our driveway, pull in and then turn around and leave. Obviously it was the same car because of the muffler. So last night my wife wakes up at 3 and goes into the living room to see if she can see if they do it again. Just as she was about to say screw it and come back to bed she hears the the car, and sure as shit it pulls in our driveway, and leaves. At this point my wife wakes me up quite frantic. So I have her call public safety and see what we should do. They had a detective call her back and they said they would patrol the neighborhood tonight and see if it happens again. Now we do not know if this happens every night or what, but it's kinda creeping me out. We have an alarm and I sleep with a .9 mm under my bed, but we have two children and this is fucked up to say the least. So tonight we are going to wake up at 3 and go into the living room and see if they come back and if they police get his ass. We live in the back of a quiet subdivision, hell I leave my keys in my truck, and nothing has ever been stolen, so for this area where we live it's quite odd. I also cannot think of any good reason this person would be turning around in our driveway. So anyways that's my story. Figured Reddit would be the perfect place to share my story. I will post what happens tomorrow. My question is what in the fuck is this guy doing? Your thoughts are welcome and anticipated. Thanks for reading.

TITLE: To go or not to go? Old friend (f, 23) getting married, I (f 23) don't want to because I have to go from here in the Netherlands to USA.

POST: So, I have had this friend for a long time and we have always been there for each other. But about 6 months ago I moved here to the Netherlands to be with my partner (m23). This is our first place together here and we had to buy our own furniture. Needless to say we don't really have any money for trips. 

My friend is getting married in March in the USA and I feel really guilty out of obligation but I really don't want to go. I don't have the money for it and I don't want to leave here and miss my partner. 

Reasons for not wanting to go:

1. Money
2. Missing my partner. 
3. Being incredibly bored once I'm there! I won't have a car or a way to get around, so I'll just be sitting in my parents house all day.

TITLE: Am I being unreasonable about my [26F] boyfriend's[26M] behavior?

POST: A few weeks ago our neighbor, who is also our friend, invited us over for her friend's going away party that she's hosting. Her friend is moving across the country. 

My boyfriend knows our neighbor's friend because his ex girlfriend slept with her (cheated on him with her, sort of). He's seen her around town and he tried to sleep with her long before we got together. He's made a few comments on her looks in the last few days before the party -- big boobs, big butt, ""she's actually pretty attractive"". This doesn't bother me, but I know I'm not his go-to type. I'm petite, but I bust my ass at the gym doing squats to try and get the booty going for us.

Last night was the party. He was out late working until 1:30 AM or so. I left the party around 11. When he came home I was already in my robe. He's not super social and prefers to stay home and relax with me, but for some reason he expressed the desire to stop by our neighbor's party. This was weird because he doesn't really care about the people at the party and in previous situations had passed on seeing them. He had been standing for four hours solid, hauling his heavy gear, and it was 2AM. He insisted on going anyway, which I was fine with.

This morning she added him on Facebook and he accepted. This made me uncomfortable when I looked at the culmination of things (previous flirting, the comments the week before, and that he went out of his way to talk to her at the party and tell me about it when he got home. He was only at the party for 15 minutes or so). I expressed my discomfort and he got defensive and angry.

Am I being unreasonable?

TITLE: TIFU by writing a smartass final paper

POST: So actually happened a few years ago...

SALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!

was my Freshman writing seminar instructor may her name be cursed for a thousand generations. The topic was ""great new books."" Being an open-minded starry-eyed freshman, I thought this would mean ""fiction."" Nope. Poetry. Shit. 

So Sally always insisted that all of our analytical essays were full of cultural stereotypes. This was really difficult to avoid and got on everyone's nerves, particularly because all the poetry we were reading was really heavy stuff and had to do with race, inequality, poverty, etc. It felt like we couldn't even mention race without being ""insensitive."" Fast forward to the final paper.

Sally has a friend who is an impoverished poet, and Sally assigns us her book (called ""a vertical interrogation of strangers"") to read. The book is basically a collection of poetry based on the author's interviews with anonymous Indian women regarding their (often abusive) relationships to men. I choose to write about this book for the final paper. I have had enough of Sally and her lectures on ""stereotypes"" at this point. In fact, I am so tired of her that I become convinced that her friend's book is a giant cultural stereotype. I think you can get where this is going...

Yup I decide to write my paper on how my professor's starving poet friend's super artsy feminist book is actually a cultural stereotype and unfair to Indian men. At the time I thought I made a pretty good argument and was looking forward to changing my professor's perspective on things...

TITLE: Reddit, how can I fix myself?

POST: To put things short, I've had a pretty inadequate life so far. I'm ugly, short, underweight and not all that intelligent either.

 I have very few skills or interests, I have very few friendships (most of which are dwindling rapidly), I can't speak to women without either mumbling unintelligibly and apologizing in my head to them for daring to come into their presence, and I cannot for the life of me imagine a future where I don't end up killing myself. 

Over the years I've developed an almost crippling fear of people my age to the point where I can barely introduce myself to anyone who isn't at least forty years older than me.
I am ruled by a subconscious council of people who mocked me in the past and I'm pretty much keeping my behaviour in regulation of how they would expect me to behave. I am living as the caricature they established of me, I am fulfilling the future they planned out for me.
I have almost forgotten what it's like to be content with life, I am ruled by an enormous apathy for my own existence. I can't eat properly, I can't sleep properly, I've tried going to therapy but I always find myself switching off to whatever's said as I believe my perspective to be infallible. Am I really not meant for existence? Just some genetic mishap that wasn't meant to continue living? 
What can I do to? I'm pretty much coming to you guys because I have no other outlet to express my pathetic rambling, for almost half a year I've dedicated most of my life to mindlessly browsing Reddit, seeing the interesting lives of others and wishing I had the same. I guess it would be fitting that the life-changing advice that I've been sifting through countless platitudes for comes from the place I most frequent.

TITLE: My (18M) sister (23F) is going through cancer for the 3rd time and I'm terrified.

POST: I've been through the rounds so many times that everything just feels dull whenever cancer is brought up. My 23 year old sister is going through her 3rd kind of cancer in her life and I'm at the point where I don't know how to feel anymore.

We came to America from Syria when I was very young because both my sister and my twin brother had cancer at the same time (him, testicular, her, brain) for the better medical treatment options available in the states and we've been here ever since trying to deal with a new life and new surroundings. Sadly, my twin died when we were around seven,  but my sister survived both the brain cancer and the pancreatic cancer that sprang up on us about five years ago.

Surprisingly still, she survived that as well, but as far as I can surmise, some of the tumor was not removed and it ended up growing around the stomach. Recently, she has barely been able to eat more than a bite for the entire day and if she tries, she ends up throwing everything up. She's nearing barely eighty pounds and is always in pain.

I'm constantly surrounded by the emotional trauma and stress of a family in crisis and I don't know what to do anymore. My dad has worked himself dry trying to support a family and a sick child, and we've all come out of these struggles with more scars than we can count.

I love her dearly and even though we don't talk and aren't the closest, simply imagining her not being a part of my life anymore makes me shut down. She's going for her first appointment to schedule chemo tomorrow and because of how I've dealt with all this I have a horrible aversion to hospitals.

How am I supposed to show her that I care? How am I supposed to be the strong one in this family? How am I supposed to keep on going? I can't do anything and I feel like everything is crumbling around me.

Okay, so 2 months back, my pregnant sister called our house the day before her birthday, telling us to come pick her up.

We went and first thing I see is everything is messed up...she's crying, he's laying on the bed. We ask him whats wrong, and he says he doesn't want to talk about it.

We leave with my sister and she tells us she was pissed off at taking care of his dad 24\7, and an argument took off from that, nothing happened for a while but they were laying on the bed when my sister was looking at pics of our grandma that past away recently...she was crying and he thought she was crying because of the fight and hit her to prevent ""harm"" to the baby..and apparently this is the second time it's happened.

We came home noticed her nose was bleeding, she was so determined to get a divorce, but she changed her mind a couple of days after he sent a letter ""apologizing"". 

I feel guilty because maybe I shouldve hit him for touching my sister, but I have a habit of ruining relationships so I didn't do anything.

Now my parents are back and idk how but they talked thru it and now want us siblings to forget about it and act as if everything is normal.

POST: So I've been talking with this guy online for a few months, and things have been going really well.  I have some intimacy issues, but it's amazed me how able I was to be upfront about my issues with him (as he has been with me) before even having met him. I have definitely been developing feelings for him.

I finally met him last night, and it was amazing.  We cuddled all night long, had amazing sex, and I just felt so safe and content.  I am developing feelings for this guy fast.  The problem is, he confessed that he's polyamorous, meaning that he doesn't feel fulfilled unless he is able to have several 'committed' relationships.  I don't have any problem with this idea in theory, but in practice, in my own life, I'm struggling with it.

It might help to know that I shut out dating due to trauma and those intimacy issues for a long time, and I've only recently started dating.  I've had nothing but horrible luck up to this point in the guys I've seen, and this guy feels like something different.  Like I could actually see something develop.  But due to my deep insecurities and intimacy issues, I don't know if/how I could do this.  I am already in therapy for these issues, by the way.

Has anyone been in a similar boat?  Would you be able to do this in my shoes?  I want to hear whatever your input is, because I'm totally lost.

TITLE: Tifu by not asking out a girl sooner.

POST: DISCLAIMER: I am in highschool and this happened a week ago.

There was this girl who said she liked me and that she needed someone to talk to because ""everyone hates her"", so we started talking. After a while we got close, I would walk her to classes and she would give me a hug every time i walk her, but after a while she stopped talking to me because some guy made a move on her. So apparently she was in-between me and this other guy at the time. She picked him, over me even though i would walk her to classes, even ditch one to see her this one time, but in the end he won. She started to not reply to my messages even though i made it clear to her that I would want us to be just friends. A while later, i went to start another convo on facebook with her, and it had appeared that i couldn't reply to her anymore, nor could I view her profile. I had found out she had blocked me. I'm assuming her new bf told her to block me on all social medias because he probably saw our previous messages, why i assume this is because we had talked before and whenever I would bring up the girl he would make an angry facial expression and also because he had also blocked me. So after I found out I was complaining to a best friend about this and he messaged the girl about how she had me blocked and she said ""I didn't know"". So fast forward till this day and she still has me blocked even after my friend confronted her. Well I guess I'm not going to talk to her anytime soon.

POST: So I've [21 M] recently begun falling for a girl [19 F] from my university and when we're in person we get along fantastically. I've known her for about a year now but only just recently started talking/hanging out more after we both showed up to a party where we knew literally nobody but the host and we just ended up talking a bunch (mind you aside from this one instance at the party we've only hung out in groups of mutual friends thusfar). But after I got her number it seems that she is pretty bad at the whole texting thing. What I mean by this is just basically if I text her she will either take quite a while to respond to my message or she just won't respond at all (even sometimes if the text has a question in it). And so far after probably a little more than a month being decent friends she has NEVER initiated the texts, it has always been me. Recently at a school bar night we were both drunk and she literally dragged me to the dance floor with her (which is extremely abnormal for me) so I'm thinking this was a sign of interest. But even after that the texting still continues to be the same.

Basically I'm worried because most everyone I've talked to says ""no girl is bad at texting, if she actually likes you she would initiate/text you back/respond in a timely matter. Get over her she's not interested"". So I guess my question really is, is it possible for someone to be a bad texter like that but still be genuinely interested in me? Or should I just accept the fact that if she did like me she would put a little more effort into texting me?

TITLE: TIFU by forgetting my keys in locker

POST: This happened just a few hours ago. 

I went to my school's gym today like any other day, and today is leg day. Wonderful. I must also note that I was tired from staying up all night finishing an assignment, but I had a good 6 hour nap at school since I finished early today. Did my work out; leg press, leg curls, leg extensions, calf raises, etc. As I was walking back to the locker room, I saw a group of females coming through. Must be the girls' volleyball team. I went to grab my stuff to go shower; towel, body wash, and shampoo, and before I realized it, I locked my locker with my keys in them. It didn't process until I turned on the water. Now here I am, luckily with a towel, realizing I forgot my keys so I decided to go to the front desk. Luckily for me, our gym was small so the front wasn't too far. Unluckily, the girls' volleyball team was still waiting in the halls as the gymnasium was being set up. I went to ask if they would cut my lock for me, and thinking my towel was wrapped tightly enough, it broke loose...in front of probably 12 or 15 girls, and a few other pass byers...I booked it straight back into the change room, and just sat there and let everything process slowly. The guy at the front couldn't stop laughing, said he felt so bad for me and that all the girls are laughing as well...

All I can hope for is that no one else knew me, and everything will just disappear and nothing ever happened. I don't think I can show my face at school tomorrow...

TITLE: Founder of my company has lost my trust...

POST: I have been working as a developer for a company for about a year of less than 10 employees. During that time, someone got put into a managerial role (that I did not agree with) and got fired afterwards; another developer has left; my founder has talked behind the backs of two other employees; my founder has not shown any recognition for hard work that has been done by employees (including myself); has shown a lack therefore of general leadership qualities (acknowledgement, compassion, direction, motivation, or hardwork);  and most of all I haven't got paid for the last 6 months (2 of which I was on medical leave) -- with hopes to finally get paid this week *crosses-fingers*.

Throughout this time, the founder has not acknowledged there is actually a money problem and commonly would issue checks that would end up bouncing at the end of the day just to make people quiet. Even to this day, how things are currently running is a mystery with the team being remotely scattered.

The founder is also an old friend of mine, but things have run pretty thin from this experience due to the lack of general respect.

Would you quit and move on? or would you give another chance at trying to continue with this job? I feel like I have already chosen to leave but I am having second thoughts.

TL;DR:","  founder of my company has lost my trust and has not shown any leadership qualities, especially in the last 6 months. Should I give another chance or leave?","  Founder is a friend, has made some extremely poor leadership decisions and my trust has been hurt. Is there any hope to save this, or should I just find a new job?"

TITLE: I [21F] am too needy with my boyfriend [21M]. How can I stop?

POST: **Background**: I have been dating my boyfriend for half a year - it's my first relationship.

We get along great when we're with each other (2-3 times a week), and text each other moderately when we're apart. Mostly jokes to make each other laugh. We communicate pretty openly and don't fight. But there's something I don't want to talk about with him.

**Problem**: I'm incredibly needy when we're apart! I constantly wait for his texts and invitations to hang out, and am disappointed when he doesn't for a few or several hours (but he texts me at least a few times everyday). Not only am I disappointed, but I get scared he's losing interest in me! Sometimes I feel offended, like he doesn't put the effort in anymore to talk to me while we're apart. It makes me feel painful, alone, and sad (ugh). But then we meet in person, and everything - having fun, getting work done, the sexy times, talking - is great 90% of the time, with minor bumps here and there. So it's become obvious to me that, because this is my first relationship and I care about him quite a lot, I have become paranoid and overly needy (uggghhhh).

He's already assured me many times he likes me, and I know that neediness/clingy-ness in any relationship is annoying and tiresome to deal with. Also, breaking up is really sad, but not the end of the world. Still, I can't resolve my feelings. 

**Question**: I can't believe I ended up being this type of girlfriend! What can I do to get my bf off my mind all the time, and how can I not be bothered by his lack of texting when he's busy/tired/doesn't have much to say? Has anyone else had this problem?

TL;DR:",  I'm overly needy when my boyfriend is busy or otherwise not available. It's starting to bother me and make me paranoid he's losing interest. What can I do to stop being so needy?,  I'm needy and disappointed when my boyfriend doesn't contact me often enough when we're apart. But expecting him to do more to reassure me is just being unreasonable. How can I mentally slap myself to stop these clingy feelings?

TITLE: My [24M] GF [23F] of 5 months, just got a job a few hours away. Need help on making a LDR work

POST: So my gf and I have been dating for 5 months and it has been incredible. She is honestly the sweetest, best person I have met, and we just click! I am currently in a crazy part of my schooling where I am constantly busy. She has been amazing with it, has never nagged me when all I could do was come over and study, and for that I am so grateful as school has cost me 2 relationships already.

Well she has been wanting to move to a city 2 hours away from us since I met her, I just never thought it would happen this fast. I have been planning on moving to the same city for about 2 years now, just need to finish my schooling. Well she just got offered a job so will probably be moving in the next few weeks. I am beyond excited for her, but I am stuck here until August at the earliest. After this term my crazy schedule calms down ALOT, so that will let me go and see her.

We have both talked, and we both love where the relationship is, and want to do the long distance thing until I move to the same city. She has done the long distance thing before and said it was bad, it was a few states away, for a year and a half, and was hesitant to do it again, understandably. We talked and I said I am not 20 hours or more away, I am 2. This isn't for a year and a half with no end it sight, it's until August or september, I have planned to move there as well since before I met her so it wouldn't be me following her. She then sounded much more at ease about the situation. 

What I am wanting to know is how can I make a LDR work well? I plan on visiting her whenever I get a chance, which is sparingly, but what else can I do? This girl is seriously wonderful so I want to make this as easy for her as possible.

TITLE: I'd [16 M] hate to have feelings for her [16 F].

POST: I know, I know, it is generic. We have known each other for about 5 years now, and in that time we have become the best of friends. We've established that no matter what happens in our friendship, that we will never cuddle, kiss, or have feelings for each other. 

But recently we have been communicating non-stop and sometimes I just feel like I may have feelings for this person. But I am afraid to say something about it or point it out in the event that she won't continue being my friend, which is what's more important to me than dating her. We were talking the other day about what we look for in a partner, and I listed some things, (I am [trait], enjoy [verb], and have [noun].) and her response to that was basically, ""But dude, I am [trait], enjoy [verb], and have [noun]."", with the EXACT same things I listed. It made me pause and think that maybe she said that in the hopes I would get a mother fucking hint. But I dunno. She told me she did some stuff with this guy, and for some reason it really set me off.

 And now I can't stop thinking about her, but at the same time, I know I shouldn't think about her in this way. I wish I could simply tell her how I feel. It's basic Middle school bullshit, but it's driving me nuts and starting to stress me out. It's like this little guy tugging at my shirt telling me to be sad about it and stuff, telling me to not be able to enjoy my life without her.

TL;DR:","  I have feelings for my female friend, but we have established that we will never have romantic feelings for each other. But recently I feel like I may have feelings for her. Should I say something or just leave it be?","  I'm afraid I'm falling for my best friend, sometimes I feel like she feels the same way but if I told her how I feel, I may lose her as a friend."

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my [22 M] 2 month, roommate and I'm sick of him having friends over to smoke weed and use our stuff

POST: Kind of an unconventional post here, but here it goes:

My roommate is a guy that smokes a ton of weed at just about any hour of the day. In fact, I heard him fill up his bong at 9 this morning in the sink near my room. I'm cool with him smoking weed, I mean you do you, bud. What I'm not cool with is his blasting music when I'm trying to do work (we share a wall), the awful smell that comes from his room seeping in to mine (again, right next to each other), and the sheer number of people that come over for an indefinite amount of time (the door is literally unlocked so his friends can walk in whenever). These guys use our water at a rate that I'm not okay to split with my roommie at our agreed 50-50 rate. These guys use our toilet paper at a rate that I can't afford and have been stuck in a situation where I've had to hobble out to the drug store to buy more twice so far. These guys order pizza every night and then my roommate makes a big deal when I ask him to buy dish soap or do a fucking chore. In fact, as I was writing this, another guy walked in and he cleared his bong. IM. FUCKING. DONE.

TL;DR:","  Roommate has friends over to smoke weed and use our stuff, the smell and number of people that come over is disgusting and I'm sick of it.",  Roommate smokes weed with his friends. Super disruptive. Won't pay for anything and makes a big stink about me asking him for help.

TITLE: [21M] here. GF [19F] who I've been dating for 2 months is now acting strange. What to do?

POST: Hello everyone. I've been dating this girl for about two months and I liked her very much (still do). From what I understood she liked me very much too (even maybe more). From the very beginning she was super friendly, almost always texted me first, and so on. She even initiated our first kiss herself. 

Now here's the problem. About a week and a half ago she started to act weirdly. When asked why, she said she's exhausted because of the things in her university and lessons at the choir she's singing in. And yeah, she's been really busy, a lot of concerts and blahblah. She also said, that she's sad or something, springtime sadness she called it.
 

6 days ago I asked her (through text, because she has a free week and is at family's home in different city) to tell me if she still liked me or is she tired of me, because I'm not a fan of her being like that. She said, that she's confused, kind of isolated from people or from communication and doesn't know why is she like that.

I was told by her to relax because she's thinking about things and doesn't want to do a mistake and that everything will be clear after that free week of hers. Then I told her ""I kind of sense where this is going. Tell me when you're finished thinking. See you don't know when"". She said ""OK, see you soon"". It's been about 6 days without any contact and that free week is ending tomorrow.

Sorry for the long text and for my bad english, but I'm feeling really sad and confused, trying hard not to text her. What should I do? Have anyone ever dealt with something similar? PLEASE HELP.

She's a heavy user (not poster, but rather ""stalker"") of social networks. A lot of the time she quickly ""homescreens"" when I look at her using her phone, where I'd catch a glimpse of Facebook/Instagram. When using my PC/iPad, she'd sometimes clear the brower history after use.    

In a relationship where we've agreed to be open about everything, I just find this little thing biting away at me.

POST: Basically, over the course of the last 6 months or so, I've slowly started to come to the realization that we may just not really have much commonality between us anymore. It seems we pretty much subscribe to different philosophies for almost everything, and while in the past 15 years this has never been a problem, lately it has been escalating. Part of me wonders if I'm just being the asshole that can't just overlook the differences anymore, but she's become increasingly defensive of her viewpoints even when no argument is taking place (partly catalyzed by her boyfriend whose philosophies are exactly in line with hers, so even when it's just the two of us hanging out it feels like a two-on-one - and I know part of my feelings from this are jealousy). I am just deeply disturbed by the idea of losing her as a friend due to some what SHOULD BE insignificant differences and I'm feeling more depressed than ever since that last big argument. I could go on and on but seeing as this probably won't even be read by anyone, I'll keep the details for later if there is actual interest.

TITLE: My friend is trying to stick his dick in crazy. The crazy mentioned is myself. Please tell me how to stop him.

POST: Throwaway, because my main account is known to people in RL who should probably remain ignorant of this. Large amount of text to follow:

I am 19, female. He is 20. We have known each other since elementary school and were best friends starting in junior high. We have a great relationship and are mutually supportive. However, he has recently been expressing an interest in me that I do not reciprocate.  

He's constantly touching me, bringing up the topic of sex (porn he's watched, asking what I like, etc.), and joking that he can't wait to sleep with me. When I came out as lesbian, he thought I was lying to make him stop, which was completely untrue. This makes me uncomfortable, to put it lightly, and I've asked him to cease and desist numerous times, but he always sort of shrugs it off. 

Here's the summary of my brand of crazy: I am diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder, which is the mental equivalent of getting every STD at once. I've been dealing with it for most of my life now and the meds give me an ultra-low sex drive. I also have a massive aversion to being touched because of physical abuse in my youth. I do not come to my friend with my emotional problems; that's what my therapist is for, and I don't want to burden him. He knows the details, but he has never personally witnessed an episode because I am always doped up.

He kind of presses all my buttons in the wrong way. Last time I rejected him, he threatened to 'deprioritize' me on his list of friends, saying that if we weren't taking this relationship any further then he didn't want to invest so much time in it. He apologizes afterwards but I do feel scared and sort of lost. 

Reddit, he is literally my only friend and I don't want to lose him. More importantly, I don't want to lead him on. I'm not ready for a relationship of any sort - I have uni and personal demons to face. How can I get him to back off and stop trying to stick his dick in crazy?

Like your regular FU, this takes place few hours back. The scene is i'm waiting for my parents to get out the house and i'm running a bit late for a movie. So in my anxious wait. i decide to speed up things a little by taking the car (rented one) out of the porch and outside the gate to minimize anymore delay (Mistake 1). So while reversing, i noticed one corner was a bit too close to the gate so i asked my watchman to stand there and see if its all good. I see him through the mirror and he signals me saying it's all good, so i happily continue reversing (Mistake 2). After a few seconds, i hear a breaking sound, immediately stopped the car and got out to see one half of the bumper guard (an additional bumper infront of the main car bumper) broke off as it got caught in the gate while reversing which i couldn't see. Hearing the breaking sound, my dad comes out and sees the bumper, and hasn't said a word about it yet. I googled the replacement bumper and it costs around $140. My dad and I are not exactly on good terms so i don't know how or when he is going to react and i'm still in college, so I can't exactly pay for the damages.

So there my (now ex) girlfriend moved into New highschool. She didn't move houses just schools. There was this boy that ended up befriending her on every social media. FB, Instagram, Twitter.  He began liking a lot of her pictures and she liked a few of his. I asked about him, and she said she didn't know him but was just returning the favor to be nice. I didn't think much of it. 

Fast forward until about 2 days ago. I saw a text pop up on her phone, and it was the same guy. They weren't talking about cheating or anything, just hey what's up and stuff. So I talked to her about it and she ended up telling me that she actually did know him and and talked to him a few times. She told me she thought he was cute, and that he told her friend he liked my girlfriend. so I asked her to unfriend him on everything and she agreed. She did.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] of 2 months, her mother is not acting like a mother should.

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 months now since the 4th, and the relationship between her and I is wonderful. We get along extremely well, and love each other very much. 

-

She has had a hard past, and even present. Her father left the family when she was young, and she hates every thought of him. Her mother had to support her two daughters for many years working many jobs, which led to not much one-on-one with her loved ones. All of my girlfriends life she has been scarred by past events and it has left her a very sensitive person which I completely respect.

-

Her mom remarried to a different man and they had 3 more children, so the total is 5 living in one household. Financially they are stable, but sometimes not everyone gets along and the love often feels distant for her (my girlfriend). 

-

Her moms attitude towards her is usually very negative, and they even physically take it out on each other - her mother starting most of the trouble. She takes most of her anger out on my girlfriend which I am less than okay with. She shames her, hits her, and is the main cause of her mild depression. 

-

Overall, the relationship between my girlfriend and her mother is growing distant and she is actually scared of her. Her mom puts her down on almost every occasion, and makes her feel like everything bad and terrible that has happened to her is her fault. I love my girlfriend to death and only want to see things get better for her.

TL;DR:","  My girlfriends mother is not acting like a mother should, and is causing her to be very depressed. I love my girlfriend to death and want to see things get better for her.","  girlfriend is in hateful relationship with her mother, and can't even see her; only want to improve their relationship so we can move on and make my girl happier"

TITLE: Reddit, I need your help... I almost walked in on my live-in GF cheating...

POST: Throw away account here. Im going to make as short as I can because I am too broken up to even sit at my computer right now, Its been a real rough night. So last night me and and my gf of 3 years who I live with decided to do our own thing. I was supposed to crash at a close friend of mines place for the night but decided against it last minute. I had tried texting and calling my gf during the course of the night to no avail. I wasn't very happy about this but just figured she was drunk with her girlfriends and that I would just catch her at the house. Well when I got home I walked up to my front door to see my girlfriend walking in the house with some dude I have never seen before. He splits when he sees me and me and my girlfriend fight all night over it. She can barely stand up or talk because she is so wasted and eventually passes out. So, I don't know what to do. Should I take her back? How do I handle this? We have been living together for 2 years and together for 3. Most of my life revolves around the relationship and Ive honestly always thought that I couldn't find a girl who would do as much as she does for me. She makes more money and pays most of the bills and yet doesn't look down on me for it. She has always been extremely supportive of me though everything and I feel like she loves me for me. I have severe anxiety and she has been there to hold my hand in the hospital through many panic attacks. Im closer to her than any person on the planet. This morning she woke up and is destroyed by what happened and is begging me to take her back. She says she was getting a ride home and was going to pass out but who knows. I don't know what to do but the trust is broken. So guys, if there is anyone I can rely on for advice it is you... Please help.

My BF was sleeping with someone before we got together, now that's none of my business because we were not together and I am 100% OK with that happening, but when I asked him about it he told me he had not slept with her. I later found out he had.

We got into an argument one time and I caught wind that he told one of his friends something that is quite personal to me. I asked him if he had done this and he said he hadn't. I later found out he had.

He's learning to play Tennis and goes to an indoor court with a female friend that he has known for a long time once a week. He went twice last week and said one time he went with one of his friends from work rather than that female friend. I later found out he had gone with her both times.

Why is he doing this? These are pointless lies that he doesn't realize I know he is lying about. It is really making me not trust him and I now wonder what other lies he has told or will carry on telling...

POST: So, last xmas an old woman knocked on my door saying she'd found some keys and didn't know what to do with them. I said I'd keep hold of them in case anyone claimed them. 6 months went by no one collected the keys so I threw them away.

Last night my next door neighbour confronted me screaming that the keys were hers why didn't I give them back. She was absolutely vile. I was so stunned that I just apologised. She threw her hand up at me and turned her back. I walked into my house, shut the door, made dinner, carried on with my night.

Problem is I'm bloody fuming. I'm so angry that I'm struggling to just let it go. I'm mad that I apologised, I didn't know they were her keys, I didn't do anything intentionally wrong or bad. 

I know I can't change her attitude I can only change mine. Having a go at her won't help, I need to ignore her and get on with my life.

How do I just drop it now and stop obsessing about ""should have"" and ""why didn't I""? I've had barely any sleep and can't focus on getting on with my day. How do you calm down and move on?

POST: Hello r/legaladvice, I'm moving to a new town for college in Florida and signed a lease yesterday for a room within a 4/4 Apartment in a larger apartment complex for students, through a private company/corporation.

I was given the last available room within that floorplan but was refused disclosure of who my room mates are until after signing (dumb idea, I know). I was assured they were ""random people"" which is in fact not the case, it's a group of 3 people who know each other and come from a different culture, I already contacted them and it was made clear to me that they'd rather not have me there.  There are several other problems with the apartment/room that are now starting to show also, such as a lack of power outlets in the walk in closet (I was told I could put a fridge in there) and a few other things.

I haven't taken possession of any keys yet and my lease doesn't officially start until August, all I really did was sign off on the lease, a few addenda and a guarantor form. What's my legal standing in this instance and is there a way I can break my lease? If need be I can pay some fines but there's no way I could pay off the whole lease or something to that extent. 

Any help appreciated!

TITLE: Reddit, broke my friends mac, what do I do? More info inside ...

POST: Ok I'm shitting a huge one. 

Two days ago I took my pal a cup of tea, as he was working on our kitchen table.

The mug was wet, slipped from my hand, hit the table and splashed tea on his MacBook. 

Immediately I grabbed the laptop, turned the thing upside down (moisture away from electronics) and did a force power off. 

Then we cleaned up, he wiped off the mac, and said it would probably be fine - not to worry. He then powers the mac back on. Mac works.

A few hours later he goes to plug in to the charger, and realises the battery won't charge. The power lead keeps the mac on and powered but won't charge the battery.

So now I'm really bricking it. He books into the 'genius' bar to get the thing looked at. Repair estimate - £570 (GBP.) Can't get it fixed elsewhere as this will void warranty.

I am a student and have less than that in the bank to pay for rent etc, have a part time job which pays the bills. 

Do I lump up all the money? Does he have to take some responsibility ? He has no insurance. Any advice would be great, cause I'm not going to sleep until I have this sorted.

POST: not sure if reddit will be particularly interested in my story here... 
I'm a 19yr old [M] and just broke it off with my girlfriend after 13 months. I, a few weeks later, want to try and restart said relationship.

The reason I decided to break it off was that she was unhappy despite the fact that our relationship was great in and of itself. She felt neglected and lonely when I would hang out with my friends (male and female) or seem to enjoy myself without even when she couldn't be there. She has friends, but not to the same capacity that I do and didn't always feel like hanging out with me and my friends. 

Essentially, I broke it off because I couldn't resolve this dynamic in our relationship that seemed to be getting more and more unhealthy. The thing is, I would very much like to get back together with her and I think she feels the same way despite it not ending on very good terms.

POST: I have been with my boyfriend for almost a full year now. We are so incredibly close and have spent nearly every single day together. I have never been so close with someone, even past people I was in love with. 

Anyway, he has a pretty cool job - he is self employed, and does magic for weddings and restaurants and corporate events - classy, adult close up magic. None of that bunny in the hat stuff. He is young and very very cute, tall, and gets a lot of girls giggling and winking at him, which I understood when entering the relationship was part of the deal.

He used to do this trick, which he once did on me when we first met, called the kiss trick. Where he pretty much puts a card in his mouth and another card in a girls mouth, they kiss, and then the cards are switched. He's asked, and I've told him, this is not okay with me. He can flirt for tips all he wants but kissing crosses the line. He has plenty of other tricks. Hundred of them. He agreed. However, a week ago he was doing a wedding and ended up going a kiss trick on a bridesmaid who asked him to, who had seen the trick done by another magician before. He told me and was honest but I can't help feel betrayed and upset.

TITLE: Just Bought A Garmin Forerunner 305 For What I Think Is A Decent Deal. Thought I'd Share.

POST: So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).

Best price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all ""Health & Fitness"" products.

Went in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.

So I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.

The coupon should work on any ""Garmin Fitness GPS"" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.

Here's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.

TL;DR:",  Just bought a Garmin Forerunner 305 for what I think is a decent deal. The coupon should work on any Garmin fitness GPS as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.,"  20% off Best Buy coupon got me a Garmin Forerunner 305 for $120.

TITLE: [20M/24F] Kind of a pathetic question, but calling/texting after getting a girl's number

POST: So, I've had girlfriends before, but never met a girl that I didn't already know from school or work. I'm kinda lost.

Anyway; I got a cute girl's number last Wednesday. She seemed either a little shy or a little pressured (even though I just asked ""would you like to meet up sometime?""), said she worked often and very late, I said I do the same, which is true. I actually work later nights and also very often, so I kind of need to be up on scheduling stuff with people ahead of time. Anyway, she said yes and I got her number.

That said, girls don't really seem to like scheduling too far ahead - I'm guessing it kills any feelings of spontaneity (sp?)... So I texted her Friday, asking if she wanted to meet up Sunday (today) because people never pick up when you call them these days. No response. It's not like a lot of time has passed, but still, 2 days is plenty of time to type out a text.

I'm kinda thinking I could call her (can get a straighter response, and I prefer it to texting anyway) this afternoon. But I don't want to ruin anything by calling, either. I'm not afraid of rejection, but I hate not knowing.

Where I live, it's also common to not have a plan for your phone, so instead you'd fill it with a bit of money and use that up. She might not have any money on her phone, and thus can't reply. Probably wishful thinking...

Is she just not interested? Think I might as well give her a call? My gut feeling is saying that if she's interested it doesn't actually matter that much what I do, but I don't want to make a big faux pas already. Unless I already have.

I'm probably overthinking this. I know getting a number isn't a huge accomplishment, perhaps this girl never even wanted to see me at all, so it feels kinda off asking this question in ""dating advice"". But some general ground rules, if nothing else, would be really helpful.

TL;DR:","  Got a girl's number, asked her to meet up sometime, no response. Is she just not interested? Should I call or text anyway?","  got number Wednesday, texted Friday about meeting up Sunday, no response as of yet, could I just as well try and give her a call or should I just give up?"

It would be cool to take her hiking/camping somewhere, or do something similar, and maybe a show somewhere in there.

TITLE: Friend [25M] is married, but can't get over feelings for me [22F].

POST: I  (22f) was briefly enrolled in a graduate program this fall, and am still in close contact with a lot of friends I made while I was there.  One of these friends is a 25 year old guy from China.  

Because English was not his first language and I could tell he was a little isolated, I was careful to be nice and invite him to events.  We started hanging out some on our own, but mostly just to discuss school/world politics; nothing too personal.  He asked me out a few times this fall, and even though I assumed he was single, I turned him down nicely-- just wasn't interested.

After the final time I turned him down he got a little clingy and weird, so I tried to create some space between us; I didn't really speak to him over Christmas break.

Imagine my surprise when my presumably single friend comes home from China married after Christmas!  Turns out he'd had a girlfriend all along and they tied the knot while he was there.  I assumed that settled things, and went back to occasionally spending time with him.

Last night, he admitted to me that he's jealous of the guy I've been dating and has feelings for me.  I sort of just apologized and ignored it, but now I'm frustrated and not sure what to do.  Normally, I would just cut things off with him since he doesn't seem to be able to have ""just friends"" feelings toward me.  In this case, though, I feel guilty, since he really doesn't have many friends and seems to put a lot of energy into maintaining contact with me.   So what should I do?  Just end things?  Pretend it never happened?  All I know is that I certainly wouldn't want MY husband spending time alone with a woman he had feelings for.  I don't want to cross any lines.

The *general* trend is down (28lbs today - holla!) but what I've noticed is that every time the ""whoosh fairy"" visits me and gives me a nice chunk of weight loss, she takes back some of it over the next week. Then she gives me just a *bit* more - enough to keep the graph going down. Thank you, Whoosh Fairy. I love you.

It's important to note that I have absolutely no how to speak Korean except for what my friends have taught me.

'Annyeonghaseyo?'
'Donde esta Ramon? Ramon?'
'Kimchee saranhaeyo. Oppa Oppa na!'
'I want to uh speak with uh Ramon. I know he is there.'

At this point, I've exhausted my Korean knowledge, so I turn to my extensive anime background.

'Dattebayo! Konbanwa minnasan! Suzuki Honda kage bunshin no justsu!'

I begin spewing out the lyrics to Just be Friends until I hear a muddled apology and the phone clicks.

I haven't received a phonecall looking for Ramon ever since.

TL;DR:",  Someone called my cell phone number in Spanglish repeatedly asking for Ramon. I politely refused and politely hung up. No phonecalls since.,  Changed my number and someone keeps calling for Ramon. I get sick of it and answer in Korean and Weeaboo until they give up.

TITLE: TIFU By tickling

POST: So the fuckup was yesterday, had my friend over lying around watching movies and YouTube. Being playful I tickle her and try to make her laugh and giggle. She wriggles and moves her knees up to her chest, in a sort of fetal position on her back. While she does this out of no where a silver metallic object falls down and hits her  square in the face. The silver object was a Mac book Air delicately balancing  she sticks her finger in her mouth. I ask if she is alright, with a slight smirk on my face and ask her to open her mouth and show me but she won't. Eventually after a long while standing by her side at a mirror in the bathroom she shows me a tiny little chip at the bottom of her front right tooth. She is tearing up abit but handles it well and asks if I can take her home because it hurts.

TITLE: Been dating him [25m] for 7 months. Now he cut off all communication with me [20f]. What do I do?

POST: I'll make this short. He and I have been dating for 7 months, and I am absolutely in love with him. He moved 5 hours away about a month into our relationship, but I had been driving to see him every few weeks. We had been discussing moving in together next year (2014, because I like to plan ahead). We've had some problems, but nothing that would indicate that this was going to happen.

On Monday, he texted me asking if I knew how wonderful I was, how much he loved me, etc. On Tuesday he and I were talking and texting before I went into work. When I got off work, I was blocked on facebook, skype, and he wasn't answering my calls.

I finally texted him saying that he has my pets (which he does, because he volunteered to watch them for me) and he said that he needed time and that he would watch them until someone came to get them. 

So, am I dumped? It feels like it, but I really don't know if it's just time apart or not. I also don't know if I want him back if he's going to pull this kind of act, but I love him and it hurts. I kept asking him if he was breaking up with me, and received no response.

TITLE: My best friend, and beer may have saved my family's lifes last night.

POST: Yeah, so I missed a call from him earlier. When I called back he said he'd call me back in a bit. So I'm farting around, looking for something to do. Watched TV in the basement for a short time and went back upstairs. I was chilling in my bed, messing with my phone when he called. He asked if he could run something by me and I asked if it was beer because I was out of beer. We decided that I'd just go over to his house so I could drink his beer and he could run something by me. When I went outside, I smelled something burning. Not just *something* burning, but it smelled like cigarette butts burning. I had recently smoked a cigarette on the back porch and outside the basement door, so I went to check. Nothing happening on the back porch, but there was a softball size glowing red wad of cigarette butts where I put my cigarette out about 10-15 minutes earlier. I realize now how unsafe our ""ash tray"" is now because it is just a flimsy plastic thing that a plant would come in, it was over stuffed with cigarette butts AND it was sitting in a bed of pine straw! So I grab the hose and easily extinguish this glowing butt fireball of death and breathe a sigh of relief.

So who knows what would have happened if I hadn't decided to go to my friends house at about that time. I would've come outside within the next half hour or so to smoke, an hour at the most and would have smelled it then if it was still smoldering. But like I said, it was a glowing ball of death in a bed of pine straw, so it could have easily ignited and then who knows what would have happened.

Oh, and my wife is out of town. Imagine making that call. Honey, umm, I uh, I burned the house down. *shiver* Can't even think about the fact that all 4 of my kids were home at this time.

I will absolutely get a can of some sorts to put our butts in to reduce the risk. Should just fucking quit smoking.

Thanks dude. Oh, he was contemplating refininancing his house and wanted to discuss it with me.

TITLE: I need advice on how to advance this...

POST: So, a little back story for all of you. 

I met this girl [16] (I'm 17 Male) about 3 1/2 or 4 weeks ago and it was a really casual thing to start out with. She was only a friend of a friend to me at first so I was like, ""Oh okay, she's just gonna chill with me and my other 2 friends."" so I thought nothing of it but she was pretty chill so we talked a good while while just skating around town, getting coffee, and then going back to my place to just relax and listen to music.

I started to like her more and more as the day went on because she's a very talented musician, very laidback, skates, and ADORES animals. She's perfect.

Well, fast forward to now, we've hung out alot since then, gone to a concert, the mall, and hung out almost all week in a couple cases, and we're still just pretty close friends. 

I'm not too worried at the moment because we talk alot and always skate together and such but I'm just wondering, how do I advance this without overstepping my boundaries? She's had bad experiences with relationships in the past so I've been very careful to not do anything that'd upset her. 

And no friends, I'm not stuck in the friendzone, I've been made aware from her friend that she's interested in me as well, she's just shy and careful around people she likes.

I would have totally taken her out for dinner already, but the only thing is that I'm currently unemployed...

SO, my question to all of you lads and lasses out there is: How do I advance our relationship without making her feel uncomfortable? 

Thank you in advance all of you. <3

TL;DR:","  Really like this girl, she's shy and cautious around people she likes, how do I advance our relationship without making her feel uncomfortable?","  I met this girl a few weeks back, she's the fucking bees knees, she's had bad experiences with previous relationships, how do I advance our relationship without making her feel uncomfortable?"

TITLE: Don't even know where to start -- very overwhelmed.

POST: Making a one-off account, for some ""privacy"". 

So I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and there has been a lot of great advice, including on the sidebar. My problem basically is -- I don't even know where to start. I know that we (my wife and I) aren't doing a good job managing money, and we've been ""trying"" to fix it for a while, but both aren't very good at this. With a little one on the way, it's really time for us to get on track.

So I've tried Mint, YNAB (can never get it working right so that I can actually use it successfully), and spreadsheets. I'm most comfortable with the spreadsheet, at least for now. It'll really be on me to manage, as my wife isn't very tech or financially savvy, but ultimately would love a way for her to access & manage. That's later...

So -- I know my income and the fixed expenses (rent, insurance, etc.). What I struggle with when creating a budget is the variable costs such as my wife's income (she's full-time, but paid hourly and paychecks vary depending on holidays, sick time, etc.), gas/electric (which changes pretty dramatically month-to-month), etc.

What about factoring in things like doctors (co-pays, etc.), prescriptions, etc. that also happen every month. I also have some ESPP, 401K, credit card debt (for the first time ever, due to multiple unexpected things happening at once... long story, doesn't matter),  Student loans, etc. One problem is that I think the money is too ""spread out"" over multiple accounts.

I'm thinking that one of the incomes could cover most of the expenses, and the other can cover leftover debt & savings, but would like to account for every dollar to make sure that is happening/can happen.

I'll need to make another post once I get all this sorted out, but where is the best place to start? If I can at least get some of the basics down that would be great.

TL;DR:","  Trying to figure out how to account for all the various expenses that happen every month, including medical bills, student loans, etc. Where is the best place to start to get this sorted out?","  My wife and I are overwhelmed with budgeting, especially with a baby on the way.

The reason why they didn't work out is because ""she didn't want it."" She came to visit him a few years ago when we were dating for about 6 months at the time and things went down that made us go through a really rough time for our relationship (he didn't cheat, he just treated me like crap and she was kind of a bitch to me). It's been 2 years since then and things have been better than ever, yet when I hear her name, I become filled with anger. I thought they stopped speaking because I haven't heard about her in a while and I hear about all of his other friends but I found out last night that they have. I asked to see a couple of messages, and all of them were along the lines of, ""you are so amazing!"" and ""omg I love you!"" I can't tell him to stop talking to her because she was his best friend, but how can I help myself not be so angry and be okay with this? If you need more information let me know, I didn't want to write too much BS.

POST: My boyfriend was very shy when we met but slowly has bloomed into someone even more social than me. Watching him find his confidence has been an incredible turn on for me. 

Lately I've felt like he's wanted to tell me he loves me. He initiates long conversations that end with awkward pauses while he looks into my eyes etc. So far he hasn't really worked up the nerve but he's been saying things like ""I love... about you"". I've been finding opportunities to reciprocate those sentiments by saying things like ""I love when you..."" and such. He made me a playlist where the majority of songs very heavily talk of loving someone.

TL;DR:","  I want my boyfriend to say ""I love you"" first. He's been hesitant to do so but has been saying things like ""I love you"" lately.

It started about December. One day he went on a night out and didn't come back. I found out later he had been playing video games with a girl all night. She was bi and had had a long term girlfriend so I didn't think too much of it. 

Then I went home for Christmas and when I came back she was there, in the flat we had bought together, and it was obvious she had stayed over. I felt bad for leaving him over Christmas so just left it. But the seal was broken.

TITLE: I left my sister in South Korea with no one

POST: I was in South Korea for two months this summer, studying abroad. I chose to go there partly because my older sister happens to live in South Korea as an elementary school English teacher and I wanted to visit her. Saved up for a year to scrape up enough money to pay for half of it (scholarships covered the other half).

I stayed with my sister for about one month of it. I understood that we'd both changed during the long time we didn't see each other so I shrugged off various things that would have bothered me otherwise, and we had a great time hanging out together and catching up and having fun. Anyway fast-forward to today when I've been back in the states for a month and she just messaged me saying that she got into a toxic relationship a few days after I left, cropped up with a host of health problems, and just found out that she has a stress-induced hernia (whatever that may be), and part of the reason is that she couldn't handle me leaving. 

As soon as she told me all this, she tried to blow it off and make light of it, especially about the relationship she's in (what details she did tell made me really uneasy). On top of that she decided to re-sign her teaching contract and stay for at least another year. I know I'm responsible for part of this situation (especially since I gave her the idea to teach in South Korea in the first place) and I could have done more to help her out but at the time I had no idea that she had counted so much on my being around. She's four years older than me and we didn't even become friends until recently. I always looked up to her because she was always taller/more beautiful/more mature than me and I was so busy being excited that she was treating me like an equal to see that she was having a lot of other problems.

I keep catching myself planning to go back to Korea as soon as I can just to try to help her out. But I can't go, because I'm in the thick of my senior year in university, I have no money anymore for travel, and I can hardly think straight myself because of school expectations.

TL;DR:","  Left my older sister in South Korea with no one, she's in a bad relationship and has a stress-induced hernia, and is now re-signing her teaching contract.

TITLE: This might sound horribly ignorant or stupid, but I was wondering about normal interaction with Muslim women.

POST: I am a pretty friendly and outgoing guy, but I am confused about something. I usually smile at people and say hi cordially (even strangers), but when I see Muslim women in headscarves, I am worried that they will take offense to me smiling and looking them in the eye. So in the end, if I accidentally make eye contact, I quickly look away so I don't feel like I am offending them, but that seems even more rude.

I am in the US, and my heritage is East Indian (Hindu). I live in AZ and women with headscarves probably already have such a hard time with discrimination in this state. I just want to do what is right. With my Indian background, I look similar to Muslims, and I am worried that that may create even more offense, as if I am leering or something when I am really just a nice guy.

My fiancee and I were at the mall yesterday, and it came up. I smiled and said hi to the women behind us in line, and they looked a little taken aback. Did I fuck up?

TITLE: Does anyone have experience with cell phone repair companies?

POST: Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my Motorola Atrix 2 and the screen cracked really badly. My phone is still fully functional, but it's a bit difficult to see what I'm doing when I'm texting or web browsing, etc. 

Anyway, I stupidly didn't buy insurance for my phone and I'm not eligible for an upgrade until next May! AT&T offers some options as far as getting a no-commitment phone at a slight discount, but spending $300-$600 for a new phone isn't really in the budget right now. I know when you start a new contract, AT&T offers their phones at a fraction of the price (i.e., $100 for a $500 phone) so would I be able to take advantage of that? It seems like I wouldn't, but I'm a little confused with how their policy works that way! I was thinking of visiting my local store.

So I was looking at [Motorola's repair center] and they said they won't repair phones that have been physically abused - so that means dropped, submerged in water, ran over, exposed to heat, etc. 

I found a couple websites that will repair your phone if you send it in. [Doctor Quick Fix] will do it for $110 and I'm still waiting on a quote from [CPR](

So my question is, have any of you used this company, or know anyone who has used it? Should I trust these companies? Do you have any recommendations? What should I do to get my phone fixed?

TITLE: Why do I [23M] feel so bad hearing about how well and happy my ex [23F] is, when she was the one who cheated?

POST: Hey guys, so I've posted on here a few times about my ex so I'm sure you can easily find it in the post history if you really want to know the context of it all and how we broke up.

Long story short, she's still with the 18 year old that she cheated on me with and I regularly hear from mutual friends about how happy she is and how she says that he is the ""true one for her"" and that shes never been happier in her life. I feel absolutely awful hearing how great she is doing and progressing because I guess there is a selfish part of me that wants her to be in a much worse situation than I am in for what she did. We were together for 3 years and speaking of marriage, which was entirely her idea to begin with.

She and I have been officially broken up for about 7 months. I understand that everybody wants to be the one who does well after a harsh break-up but I feel like my life, despite going to the gym and trying to get out more and be social after all this time, is seemingly going nowhere with no love aspects on the horizon. While she, the cheater, is out living life to the fullest with her new boyfriend.

I feel the majority of me is over her. I no longer have longings and wishes of being back together or reminisce the happier days with her. There are no romantic feelings towards her anymore which in itself has been a huge step forward for me. However, I just don't like that the person who did all this and ruined everything and crushed me so horribly with a terrible act seems to be so much happier than I am. In truth, despite getting over her romantically, I still don't think I'm anywhere near happy like I used to be.

It's late and I suppose I just needed to get this off of my chest as it has been bothering me for awhile. Maybe some other people who have been in the same or a similar situation can tell me what they did to overcome these feelings

TL;DR:",  I feel bad hearing about how well and happy my ex is after she cheated on me and I no longer have romantic feelings towards her.

TITLE: How to have a serious talk with an SO?

POST: Hey Reddit,

My SO [25F] and I [30M] are great about 95% of the time. Sometimes she does little things that bug me and I'll let her know that they bug me on the spot and she'll recognize what she did, apologize, and correct her actions. She's just as communicative with me when I annoy her with my stupid antics and I'll apologize and correct whatever it is that needed correcting.

However, the bigger issues like money, marriage, sex and overall feelings tend to be ""sit down"" conversations. When she brings up an important issue, I listen intently, take a moment to process and build a proper response then tell her how I feel and together we come up with a course of action. 

On the opposite side of the table, if I bring up an issue with her she completely shuts down. She doesn't speak, doesn't look at me, nothing. I think she's doing everything she can to hold tears back. I've told myself that I'd write a letter in the future expressing everything I felt but the conversations aren't exactly planned. I've even tried to wait it out and we both sat there for *10 minutes* in silence. Not joking. Literally 10 minutes because I told myself after 10 minutes I'd say something.

We've never yelled at each other and I love her dearly. I'm hoping there's a method or some kind of way that she'd be much more reciprocating during an important conversation. I certainly don't want to have an important conversation about how she's non-responsive during important conversations.

TITLE: Help me pick books for my mom.

POST: I apologize for the wall of text, but I want to be thorough with this.

My mom is 56, retired last summer, and kind of lapsing in the intellectual department. She's got nothing to do that occupies her time aside from watching TV. She's been doing more reading lately, even had me pick her up a booklight so should could read while my dad is asleep, but she's reading stuff that's clearly not intellectually challenging. She bought ~10 Debbie Macomber books at a garage sale and has been consuming then nonstop. She expressed some interest to me in reading something that's less fluffy, but I'm kind of at a loss on what to get her. 

I work in a bookstore, so you'd think that I'd be good at making these kinds of suggestions, and I've been trying with her. I tend to pick standard book club fodder, *The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society* was a book that she claimed to like, but there are other things I've picked up for her that she hasn't seemed interested in. 

She also doesn't want anything ""dark."" She's constantly complaining about the media that my father and I consume being too dark, too creepy, too violent, too sad, so on and so on. She doesn't seem to want anything that is too deep on the emotional scale, so I don't know what to do. I tend to feel like a book is really great when it rips my heart into a million pieces and puts it back together again in a different shape. I don't think my mom wants that. 

I'd like to get her a series, I've been thinking about *The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency* by Alexander McCall Smith, but I'm not sure. I haven't read them, so what with them being mysteries rather than romance, I'm afraid she'll think they're ""too dark"" all over again. She's voiced interest in some ""good nonfiction"" but I'm not sure where to go with that either, since reality is often darker than fiction.

Thanks in advance.

 I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?

The other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? 

Also, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans.

TL;DR:","  I have private and government loans, and I am confused about the wording of the paperwork regarding prepayment and paying it off. How should I go about paying back my loans?","  confused about the wording of my private loans, and want some help figuring out how to pay back my government and private loans."

TITLE: What can you tell me about my cat?

POST: We adopted a stray kitten that my sister found in the local Taco Bell parking lot. After watching for missing signs and seeing nothing, we decided to keep him. Great, cat, whatever. But things have been happening that, taken together, are intriguing.

1) He looks like no cat we've ever had. Slightly different gait, facial structure, and is very large. He's only about 4 months and is already probably north of 10 lbs by a bit.

2) He can't genuinely meow. He can purr, but when he tries meowing it's almost like a series of small chirps.

3) He is EXTREMELY people driven. He loves attention at all times, will go limp as a rag doll if you pick him up, plays fetch, and compulsively gnaws on your hands as you pet him, like a puppy might--no broken skin.

4) He is apparently hypoallergenic. My fiancee is intensely allergic to cat dander and doesn't do well with long furred dog dander, even. Yet she seems able to play with him with impunity.

5) The final, most bizarre thing, isn't even something he did. My aunt took him to the vet and the vet asked ""How much did [blindfire40's mom] pay for this cat?"" As we got him for free from under our tires, it's certainly odd that the vet would ask that.

To assist in identification, I've attached a [few pictures] of him. It may be that he's simply a bizarre tabby, and that's fine too, because we certainly love him. But Mom's got this idea that he's one of the intergrades between domestic and a wild cat, for the reasons listed above.

TL;DR:","  My cat is very large, hypoallergenic, and very people driven. He loves attention and will go limp as a rag doll if you pick him up. He may be intergrade between domestic and wild cat.",  My cat is weird. Lookit the pictures and please tell me if you think he's anything but a normal housecat.

TITLE: How do I [28M] motivate my GF [26F] of one year to take care of herself?

POST: Some background:

Although she is making large strides toward taking the world head on, she has extreme issues with self-image, self-worth, and an overall complete lack of confidence. She could be absolutely gorgeous if she wanted to and leave me in the dust for a much better looking guy, but she does absolutely nothing to take care of herself. She rarely wakes up before 9am, brushes her teeth about every other day, she might shave her legs once every few months. She maintains absolutely no upkeep on her body. 

She has beautiful long red hair, yet I have never once seen it in any form other than parted directly down the middle (think Millie from Freaks and Geeks). She owns absolutely no type of hair holding mechanism, any kind of makeup, and virtually no clothes. Unless she is working, she seldom wears anything other than pajamas. She seems to spend most of her days lost in the dream world of the future, making lots of grand plans, but doing nothing to follow through on them.

Let me be well understood that none of these things are required by me, but it was my understanding these things generally help women feel better about themselves.

I spend a lot of time trying to motivate her by telling her she's beautiful, smart, capable, and how much I love her. I sometimes buy things and put them in the bathroom/shower that I think she may like or may be interested in using (facial cleansers, luffas, etc.) but nothing seems to work. I am a very motivating and positive person, but most of the time I feel as if she is just ignoring my attempts to help her take life head-on.

What more can I do to help her gain confidence?

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend has severe issues with self-worth and self-image and is very unmotivated to take care of herself. What can I do to help her feel more confident and take the world head-on?,  gf won't take care of herself. rarely shaves/cleans/leaves pajamas. what do?

TITLE: Can my Financial Planner potentially screw me over?

POST: Hey guys,

I really hope this is considered the right subreddit for this type of question.

Long story short, my current Financial Planner is an old friend of mine. We recently had a fairly serious falling out and now I'm worried that my funds could potentially be jeopardized because emotion is involved.

The guy is more or less acting like everything between us is fine, however he's incredibly young (21) and in some ways childish. I can't help but worry that there may be some resentment there which ultimately leads to poor decision making or even malicious intent towards me.

Obviously the only real solution here is to disconnect entirely, which I will. What I'm really wanting to know is if there's anything I should be worried about in doing so, or if there's anything he may be able to do as I really don't know how much control a Financial Planner has over funds or how protected we are as clients.

For the record I live in Australia, if this changes anything.

TL;DR:",  Old Financial Planner and I had a falling out recently and I'm worried that my funds may be jeopardized because of it. Is there anything I should be worried about in disconnecting completely?,  My Financial Planner used to be a very close friend. We had a falling out and now I'm worried my funds are in jeopardy.

TITLE: TIFU by going to a Coldplay concert.

POST: As some of you may know, Coldplay played at the Rose Bowl yesterday on their tour. I got tickets months in advance and I guess you can say I was pumped for this event.

I woke up a tad bit late so I just ate cereal and left for the concert. Upon arrival, we walked around a bit to check out the stands and it was moderately hot outside. When I got in line with my friends and parents the line wasn't moving much because the gates haven't opened yet, so I was just standing in the beating sun. I was thinking about buying a bottle of water, but it was $6 for that and $8 for lemonade!!! 

All of a sudden, I felt my body slip and my vision start to get foggy and I blacked out and faceplanted straight into the ground. I woke up about 15-20 seconds later with ambulance people around me. Long story short I ended up taking the ambulance to the ER, I got stitches for my chin, a minor concussion, a loose front tooth, and chipped tooth all because I was dehydrated. So the lesson here is to keep yourself hydrated out there and sit yourself down if you don't feel right.

TITLE: I[18M] am worried that my [17F] girlfriend is being dishonest with me, and going behind my back.

POST: Hey r/relationships, throwaway for the usual reasons. I've been with my girlfriend for close to a year now (10th months) and things have been good. We are both seniors in high school, (i know, high school problems) and plan on staying together after high school ends. 

In the summer she started a new job in the local mall, where she became friends with a co-worker there. Before he knew how old she was He constantly flirted with her. He was 22 at the time. Whenever we were together he would be constantly texting her and she would often talk about him, and stories he told her. Not long after he met he told her about how much sex he has and things like that, and he was very open about it. 

Now, this made me very uncomfortable as he was both over the age of majority, and flirting with my girlfriend. I told her this, and she told me she would stop but she would still bring him up while we were together, even after she started a new job (previous employer didn't treat her very well.)

That brings us to last month. While I was using her phone to call mine (lost it) he texted her. Curious, I opened it (I know I probably shouldn't have, but what's done is done) and they had been talking about as much as we usually do. The worst of it being that she flirted back from what I saw. 

When I confronted her about it again she said it wouldn't happen again, but today her phone lit up while we were having lunch and it was from him. I didn't open it, but I now feel pretty hurt that she lied to me about not talking to him. 

Where do I go from here?

TITLE: Why do people hate poor tippers??? (mostly applies to the U.S.)

POST: I'll just start off by saying I was a waiter and a part time bartender (who isn't lol) And I have no problem with people not giving tips BECAUSE I'M PAID TO GIVE SERVICE ALREADY. (no matter what you think about human dignity and etc, being a waiter at a low/medium end restaurant is a low skilled low pay job. it's not worth shit. Now if you want to earn some real money, go to waiter school and etc and get into a high end restaurant. those people make 25-35k+ a year not including tips. which can push it to over 50k a year easily.)

When people go into service jobs, they get paid to give great service to the customers. (or shitty service if they're feeling self entitled) It's part of their job. Why do people feel that unless they get a great tip in return, they'll ignore their basic job description and responsibilities and give shitty service to the customer?

I know that this is way more valid in the states that forces businesses that employs people that receive tips to pay minimum wage (yes... there are states where you're allowed to pay less than minimum wage if the job has tip earning potential)

Almost every country I've been to, tipping has always been optional and in some countries it's not even an option (japan, china, etc to list some countries). Hell. When my friend tried to leave a tip in Japan, the waitress ran out with the money thinking he forgot it there... and waiters still doesn't get paid shit there either. (In China, they would just keep it but not as tip or anything. more like they found money on the streets)

When I don't give that large of a tip, people always think i'm a penny pinching asshole. (I do in bars for the bartenders since they deal with so god damn much... way worse than restaurants...) I just simply don't see a reason to give great tip when the service mostly is mediocre.

TL;DR:","  why do people hate poor tippers??? (mostly applies to the U.S.) when service is usually mediocre at most service jobs, why do people feel that unless they get a great tip in return, they'll ignore their duties?",  I see no reason to tip great when their job is to give good/great service for their hourly wage.

POST: Been dating this girl for 6 years. We both agreed it would be best if we both had stable jobs and completed our education before thinking about marriage.  
  

2 months ago I caught my girlfriend sending text messages to a 'friend' from church. It wasn't the fact that she was texting a man it was what they were talking about. One message from the other read something like 'i hope we can be in a relationship in the future'. Even after this she still continued to talk to him. Once I saw the message I confronted her about it and she acted naive and said she would end it.  
  
Fast forward to last night. After a date at a concert and a couple beers she receded to the bedroom. As I was not ready for bed I walked into the bedroom to grab my charger and a night shirt. I found her shirt up and pants down. I asked her what was going on and she replied that she was just taking a picture. I brushed it off and went back to what I was doing.  
2 hours later I climbed in bed and noticed her phone was still playing music. I reached over to turn it off and noticed that her indicator light was flashing yellow and she had a snapchat. By this point I was concerned that the picture taking was related so I opened snapchat to a single message 'wow I was not expecting that'.  
Curious as to who this guy was, and I admit at this point I am in the wrong, I searched her messages for the user name. It came back from a Facebook message from a guy who is friends with my sister and they had met at my sister's wedding 9 months ago.  
I woke her up asking who was so and so and why he would send her that message. Her reply was '... I didn't send naked pictures to him tonight'  
To make a long story short I broke up with her.

POST: I and my girlfriend are both 20 years old. I am a male and she is female. We've been together for about 3 months now and both of us go to the same college. We started off as a friends and would constantly flirt, talk about sex, wrestle, and cuddle; pretty much every indicator that we both wanted sex to happen. And eventually it did; we became friends with benefits.  The sex was amazing, and daily. We even decided to try for having sex 100 times in 100 days. At day 20 we'd had sex 27 times, and this included being apart for a week. She was insatiable, I could barely keep up with her.

Even before we started having sex I'd always had a thing for her, and as time went on we started spending more and more time together. Finally I asked her if she was willing to make what was already a relationship in all but word, official. To my joy she said yes. 

And almost immediately after we actually became a couple, her libido bombed. Circumstances beyond control forced us to cancel our attempt at 100 times in 100 days, and in the three short months since we've become official we've gone from sex one or two times a day to having sex maybe once or twice a week. More than that, she's no longer as receptive or interested in flirting the way we used to before we became a 'we'.

I'm a very, very sexual person, I feel that a healthy, frequent sex life is essential to a strong relationship. I also feel that communication is important, so I've approached her and discussed whats happened with her. Neither of us have any idea what's going on, and neither of us like it. But I'm so tired of having my sexual advances being rejected by my girlfriend that its getting to the point that I don't even want to try to initiate sexual contact anymore.

So my question is, what could have happened, and how do I fix it? And if I can't fix it, what are some tips for dealing with the physical rejection?

TITLE: Me [22/F] with my former teacher [50ish?/M] who touches me during conversation in a way that is making me uncomfortable.

POST: I'm a classical musician and I began studying with this teacher when I was 12. So I mean, I understand if he has a sort of fatherly view towards me. However, recently we started doing a gig together and I noticed that he is now touching me sometimes during conversation in ways that makes me quite uncomfortable.

During performances for example, it is common for musicians to congratulate the person sitting next to them on a well-played solo by patting their own leg in a sort of light-clapping motion. After one of my solos, in the middle of the piece, he reached over and touched MY leg. No one does that. And he didn't really pat my leg, he sort of wiggled his fingers on my leg in this sort of ""tickle"" motion which was kind of weird. 

I had a very large solo in this piece we played, and later after the piece ended, he then put his hand rather intimately on my back, leaned over until his face was literally an INCH away from my face and whispered, ""Beautiful."" That definitely made me feel quite uncomfortable.

This in addition to other such gestures has started to really grate on my nerves. However, he was my teacher and mentor for six years, has still been helping me with musical things by hooking me up with gigs and a great many other things that I'm truly grateful for. I don't think he means these physical gestures in a sexual way (OMG I hope not...), but how do I broach the subject without totally offending him or making things beyond awkward? At the same time, I don't think it's right for him to be doing that. I highly doubt he touches his male students in such a fashion.

I paid for her homecoming celebration (200-300 at least) and that pretty much emptied my bank account for the semester...in late October.

We went on a date last night and I asked her if we could split checks and this made her *livid*. ""I guess this isn't a date"" she said. I asked her why it's so hard for her, a girl with TWO jobs and a dad with an endless bank account, to just provide for herself when I'm struggling with money *every fucking day* and will be for 4 more years at least. She was annoyed and fiddled with her phone while I made attempts at conversation again until she said she can ""get used to my money situation"" because *her dad* explained that I was going to be a poor college student for a while.

And that brings me here. This girl sits on her iPhone at school and picks and chooses Nordstrom boots to buy with her dad's credit card (not even her own) and has the audacity to get ticked off when I can't afford a dinner date because it all goes towards helping me survive to the next day at college. What can I say to help her understand how ridiculous this is?

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend is completely unreasonable about how she can't provide for herself when I'm struggling with money every day and it's putting a strain on our relationship. How can I help her understand that we can both be financially responsible?,  High school girlfriend has endless money while college kid me has no money from shit I've spent to either see her or provide for her already and is annoyed at me for not having money. How do I fix this?

TITLE: Reddit, what's the best way to find a great deal on flights only?

POST: So, I'm flying with my boyfriend from PHX AZ to San Jose CA right after Christmas so he can meet my family for the first time.

We're avoiding travelocity/expedia/whatever other 'discount' websites because 1. Southwest always has better deals straight through them, and 2. I've heard horror stories and don't want our vacation to tank.

I was wondering if anyone had any tricks for finding great deals?  So far I'm finding $78-$117 per ticket (one way) as the cheapest, which isn't so bad.  But I'm curious to see if anyone has any tips or tricks I'm not aware of?  Or possibly a promo code that could help me out?

TITLE: M[20] confused by F[20] sending mixed messages regarding meeting up

POST: So a couple weeks ago I got with a girl I knew from high school at a club. In the morning she gave me her number and we've been texting a fair amount since then. 

Last week I asked her out for drinks and she said she may be busy but might be able to do Friday. She bailed on going out on the Friday as she'd been out the night before but said she'd definitely see me this week.

So I asked her tuesday if she wanted to do something Wednesday and she again said maybe as she thought she already had plans with her friend. She then text me late yesterday afternoon to say she's busy.

So I went out with my best friend who works with her and he got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She said she's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and thinks I've forgotten and doesn't really want to get into a relationship. She had mentioned both of these things the night I got with her but she'd also said she didn't like one night stands so I have no idea what I was.

Honestly I just can't quite understand why you'd say your up for going out with someone then do everything you can to avoid it. I'd begun to think she didn't want to as she wouldn't give me an idea when she could go out when I tried to ask her.

Just looking for some advice on what to do next. I feel like she is attracted to me but doesn't want to get to deep into things. Should I just ask her if she doesn't actually want to see me or just stop trying to set stuff up with her and move on?

TL;DR:",  Girl I've been talking to for a while says she may be busy but still wants to go out with me. She also says she doesn't want anything serious.

TITLE: Cheat meals (need advice!)

POST: So my basic diet (which I started about 3 weeks ago) is mostly just calorie counting.  According to everything Ive seen online, my BMR (or TDEE...I'm actually not sure what the difference of them are) is somewhere around 2500/day.  On Sunday-Friday I shoot for 1400-1700 cal/day.  On Saturdays I'll have a light breakfast and light lunch, and then a cheat meal for dinner.  My overall goal is to keep Saturday under 2700 cal.  
  
So, yesterday was cheat meal.  I planned the whole day out to be 2400 cal.  For dinner we went to chili's and I got a bacon cheeseburger and swapped the fried for corn on the cob.  I also had 3 diet cokes.  I wake up this morning, and I'm nearly 3 pounds heavier than when I weighed myself yesterday.  
  
Does this represent an actual 3 pound gain, or is it probably just food and drink sitting in my stomach.  Should I be doing something different in cheat meals? It was a really good meal, but if its going to undo an entire week its not worth it.  Its kinda frustrating because everyone who is successful seems to really repeat the calories in, calories out thing, but that equation doesn't explain a huge overnight weight gain.

TL;DR:","  Was eating a calorie controlled diet, cheat meal yesterday which resulted in a 3 pound gain.  Is this normal, or should I be doing something different in cheat meals?",  Went way above normal cal/day (but still very close to BMR) for cheat meal.  Three pounds heavier the next morning.  Problem with meal? Problem with scale? Normal reaction?

TITLE: First kitten... my brother and I disagree on something.

POST: My brother and I adopted a kitten from a friend who's roommate next year is allergic to cats. Everything's fine so far, since we grew up with cats (We know what we need to take care of them), but we disagree on what I think is a fairly major issue.

My parents, when raising cats back home, would leave out a bowl of dry cat food and a bowl of water in the kitchen. That's how I wanted to feed our kitten, by just supplying a little in a bowl and keeping it at a near constant level as we notice it going down. My brother, deciding that the way our parents fed our cats contributed to our oldest cat's weight gain (He's been with us almost 16 years now, and has been fat since he was 2 or 3, and my brother has seemingly forgotten how often my mom treated the old cat with turkey and other cat treats), is trying to tell me that we need to only feed the kitten at certain times, and in certain portions.

That just feels wrong to me, since it's obviously going to still be growing, and I don't think he should be worried about weight gain in a kitten. And I'm not trying to tell him to leave a full bowl out all the time, but to just leave some in there for when the kitten gets hungry at a non-brother approved time.

TITLE: Move my stuff for your own? what?

POST: okay so yesterday I was at a local baseball game and I was sitting with a friend of mine. Since no one was sitting on the bench next to me, I put my purse and water bottle next to me. About 2 innings in, a woman comes up to me and asks me to move my stuff. 
Me, being a kind person and assuming that she was going to use that seat for sitting, I put my bag and water bottle on my lap. 
Then the woman PUTS HER OWN PURSE on the bench where my stuff used to be and sits down next to it (mind there is plenty of space further down the bench).

TITLE: 24F: 26M boyfriend wants to reconnect with the girl he was seeing when we started dating?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. When we started dating he was seeing multiple people. He ended it with them about a month and a half into our relationship. I never knew he had been seeing other girls until months later. It has been a source of pain for me in the relationship (our first kiss or date don't feel special knowing he was sleeping with someone else the night before)

One in particular, he has built a bit more with. They dated about a month. When he ended it with her she was very hurt, which suggests that there are unresolved feelings on her side. They did not know each other prior to dating, and have not spoken since.

We are moving overseas in a month. My boyfriend has decided to go for drinks with this girl to say goodbye. He has expressed a desire to tell her what he is up to because she would feel proud. He also said that although he has no romantic or sexual feelings, he still feels emotions for her.

I am very uncomfortable with this. I dont understand why it is important to say goodbye to a closed chapter that he hasn't spoken to in over a year. I am uncomfortable with the fact that his train of thought was how proud she would be of him.

I suggested either emailing/phoning her, or me being introduced to her before they go out, but he turned down both of this options, saying he wouldn't want to put her in the awkward position of meeting the girl he left her for (even though she never knew he left for another girl). Shouldn't my own uncomfortable position be taken into account?

Any input would be greatly appreciated. The fact that we are moving makes any red flags even more important so that I don't make a mistake.

TITLE: I got 1/2 of the credit cards I wanted. Should I get rid of the secured card with a monthly fee?

POST: I had this $500 secured credit card with PNC for almost two years. I also rode along my mother's car loan.  Earlier this year I applied for PNC cash builder and was denied, but was approved for target credit card (5% at target), sallie mae (5% at Amazon), and Amazon credit card (I did this one before learning about sallie). I was initially given 300 limit for target but they upped it to 800 after five months. Amazon and sallie both gave me 3100 limit.

I recently applied for pnc cash builder again and got denied again. They really don't like the loan amount vs my income. Anyway, now that I have some real credit rolling, can I go ahead and terminate the secured credit card? It charges $3 monthly and I don't see a reason to use it now that I have cards that give me rewards. I would like pnc cash builder because that's the checking account branch I use, but I don't see the car loan going away in less than two years. I suppose there's citi double cash card but I doubt I'll qualify now that I had so many hard checks this year. The secured card is the oldest credit line I have so my credit score will probably take a hit when I get rid of it. Sallie/target won't take the cards back though right?

POST: My Boss just sent me home because I was trying to clarify exactly what he wanted me to wipe down the tables with. Of course it didn't start out as an argument, but when I was attempting to double check what spray cleaner to use (so that I didn't ruin the finish or anything like that) he decided instead of flat out telling me to just continue to yell at me for the amount of times he had to ask me to wipe them down. I am a sensitive person (okay fine I'm totally a cry baby) and my eyes started to well up as I was attempting to defend myself/just figure out what solution to use so I could start wiping them down! No tears fell, and I've explained to him before that I'm an emotional person, that just because my eyes start to well up does not mean I don't have a hold on myself, my tear ducts routinely betray me! This made him even angrier and so now I have the afternoon off I guess.

I don't normally wipe the tables down, thats not in my job description, and I usually arrive after the morning shift completes the task, so I've never seen it done before.

TITLE: Relationship seems to have hit a speed bump between me (19M) and (19F)

POST: All right, here's the deal. When the semester started, I met this girl in my Chem lab and we started talking. Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. 

Two weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. 

So we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. 

Anyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one. So I suppose my wondering here is what I should do to make it clear that I am open to a relationship and fostering that relationship potential, while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs.

The trouble is that she is 17 years old  (18 shortly after new year) and I'm concerned that the age gap is too large considering how young she is.

My one friend, for some reason, kept trying to hook me up with one of her boyfriend's friends, even though she knows I have a boyfriend and that I was not at all interested. Anyways, as it turns out, later in the night when I am past gone, the guy decides to take me home with him. One of the things I do remember is him asking me to ""get out of here"" and saying no. But my next memory is of standing outside of a cab in an area I didn't recognize. The following memory I have is him unwrapping a condom and then after that the memory of getting dressed. That's all I know.

I am beyond distraught and have been a crying mess for the past few days. The first thing I did though, was head to the clinic to get an STI test. The nurse told me it was too early to test but because I came so quickly they could give me pills to cure Gonorrhea and Chlamydia ""just in case"". The guy has also emailed me over facebook and I have confirmed that we did have sex and that a condom was used.

Also, in his last relationship, he told his gf that he loved her, and she decided shortly thereafter that she did not want to be with him anymore because she did not feel the same way.  I think he's hesitant to have the same thing happen with me. 

Now, I really feel that he loves me too. The way he looks at me, how thoughtful he is, the little things he does for me, all leads me to believe that he loves me too. I've met all of his significant family members, I've met all of his friends, we dressed up in a couples costume for Halloween, etc. But on some level I do not really know because he has not said it.  

I guess I just want to know if it's strange that I am so scared, and if you all felt that it was too soon to tell him how I feel. How do you feel about women saying it first?

TL;DR:",  Been with wonderful guy for 3 months. I love him but am afraid to tell him because I have never said it before. Is it too soon? How do you feel about women saying it first?,  When is the right time to say you love someone? Should I (a female) be afraid to say it first?

TITLE: My (17 M) close friend (16 F) who I previously had a relationship with has become hostile to me for dating another girl who happens to be a close friend of hers

POST: I know people in this sub tend to look down on teenage drama but this has been bugging me recently.

My old SO, we can call her Jane, were in a relationship for a significant length of time during middle school. Post relationship, I maintained a sort of ""gay best friend"" friendship with her; a very very close platonic partnership. Jane was supportive me of in my quest for love through high school, and I tried to help her out as well, but she has yet to have any luck whatsoever.

Recently I started dating a third girl, who we will call Jill. Jill is in the same small friend group as Jane is, and I gained interest in Jill at the beginning of this year of high school. Jane was supportive of me, but she had big doubts about my chances will Jill, until it slipped out that Jill knew I fancied her and wouldn't mind a date. Even though I have seen images of these conversations, Jane has been telling me that Jill doesn't want to date, which I know is false because we began chatting up and are prepared to do an official first date soon.

As soon as news of this broke, Jane began to be more hostile to me that usual. We went from chatting every day for a few hours to twice in the last 2 weeks. She also insults me more (this is significant because although we maintained a very sarcastic attitude with each other, she has begun to cross a line and be mean). Jane is stonewalling my efforts here; it is unfair of her to intrude on this new relationship of mine. However, I don't know how to deal with this, because Jane is possibly my best friend but still is being a big nuisance.

I don't know what to do here; I don't think I have to pick between Jane and Jill but it seems that I have to make that choice. Can someone explain what is happening? I have been out of the dating game for some time so I don't really get what issues are happening.

TL;DR:",  My close friend who I previously had a relationship with has become hostile to me for dating another girl who happens to be a close friend of hers. What should I do?,"  I am split between Jane and Jill, and need help understanding Jane's issues so that I can properly deal with her and her very apparent jealousy"

TITLE: (VA) We are breaking our lease and discovered water damage after moving furniture out. Next steps?

POST: I apologize for any typos and formatting issues, writing this on mobile.

We signed the lease for our townhouse in January. Our landlord is the owner of the property, there is no middle management company. We are breaking our lease to move back to NC due to financial reasons and have had a great line of communication with our landlord since day 1. She has been working with us to find new tenants to take over the lease and understands that we are taking steps to adjust to our budget issues without missing any payments. She is empathetic to our budget issues, but not very lenient or forgiving of the rent payments.

We are taking off in the truck tomorrow, and after removing the furniture from the (fully finished) basement, we noticed warping from water damage on the wall panels. The two walls affected are exterior walls, and the damage is just below ground level, indicating foundation troubles. It's not so bad that our furniture was damaged, and the carpets are not wet, but there is definitely moisture in the walls.

We do not have new tenants signed for a lease yet, though we have shown the place to a few. We are responsible for paying rent until the either new tenants sign a lease, or our current lease ends in January. We cannot afford another month of rent here so it is very important we find new tenants soon.

My question is do we tell the landlord that we noticed it tomorrow, before they do the walkthrough Monday? We will not be here after Sunday. What we are worried about is 1) will we still be on the hook for rent if it becomes un-rentable while the repairs are being made, and 2) are we responsible for any damages if we don't notify the landlord, despite it being a structural/building problem?

TL;DR:","  Breaking our lease to move back to NC, discovered water damage in the walls of our townhouse. Do we tell the landlord now, before they do a walkthrough, or risk being on the hook for rent?","  We are breaking our lease because we can't afford to live here anymore, discovered moisture in exterior facing walls, leaving the state for good tomorrow and don't know if (or how) to tell the landlord."

About two or three years ago she mentioned that I was ""boyfriend"" material, so we decided to give it a try. She was a big Otaku, nd for a while,it was nice. Had fun,traded pictures. Dreamed of meeting one day. (She has...anti-social issues.That's all I will say)

We had rough patches like all relationships do,and I tried my best to keep us together. But last week it just got worse,and after having enough of being called an idiot, I pushed back,metaphorically, a night or two ago. I spoke some harsh words to her..and I guess fate was sealed. 

We ended it just last night, and she emailed a mutual friend(also female)Who got pissed at me as well, and joined her in cutting off all contact with me

TITLE: TIFU by buying my pregnant wife cleaning products for her birthday

POST: At 7:30am today, I got a call from the delivery company.  ""Damnit, this is super early,"" I thought to myself.  My very pregnant wife rolled over and asked who I was talking to on the phone.  I informed her there was a delivery truck on the way.  ""Happy Birthday!"" I exclaimed with a shit-eating grin.  
  
*sigh*  
  
I had spent the last few months tirelessly researching my purchase.  Our household had been plagued by constant beeping sounds coming from the laundry room at all hours of the day and night.  So much so that we had been unplugging the decade-old washer and dryer when not using them.  It had been going on for years.  I resolved myself to fix this problem.  I'm a problem solver.  It's what I do.  There are 4th of July appliance sales.  My wife's birthday is around the 4th of July.  She would *love* it if I got one of those fancy-schmancy laundry sets with the steam and pedastals, right?  Great gift, right?  Come on, guys, at least humor me and pretend I'm not an idiot for a second.  
    
So I splurged and bought the bestest set I could find and had it delivered as a present.  On my pregnant wife's birthday.  At 7:30am.  Waking her up.  
  
She groggily comes downstairs so see my present...  
  
Her:  ""You bought me CLEANING SUPPLIES?? ....  FOR MY BIRTHDAY???""   
  
Me: ""...""    
  
Her: *disappointed look*  
  
Me: ""Happy Birthday...?""  
  
Her: ""This is insulting""  
  
Me: ""I'm sorry""      

Yeah...  I am not a smart man.  We haven't spoken since the the delivery occurred.  I don't know if dinner plans are still on...

TL;DR:",  Bought my pregnant wife cleaning products for her birthday.  She found out and was disappointed.  We haven't spoken since the delivery occurred.

TITLE: My (26M) fiancee (31F) is snooping on Facebook on guys she has had one night stands with. Im supposed to be ""cool"" with it.

POST: We've been engaged for going on a year now, been together for 5 years. Im at work while she asked me to look up something on facebook. I forgot that she was using my phone earlier to log into Facebook because she couldn't find hers.

 So I go to the search bar and click on it to type in the friends name for the status she wanted me to read. Low and behold it shows that she looked up two guys yesterday that she had past one night stands with (well more or less booty calls ). I know this because we've both been very open about our past to each other.

 So I let my anger get the best of me and I confront her immediately through text. I ask her what she is doing on facebook and what's the reason that she is looking up these two guys. After much texting back and forth I get the bullshit answer that she was just nosey. I told her we'll talk about it when we get home. 

I get home and the conversation practically boils down to as previously that she was just ""nosey"" about what they're up to. I was told that it shouldn't really bother me and that I should be ""cool"" about the whole thing. 

Well im not fucking ""cool"" about it. I feel hurt and angry and jealous and confused all at the same time. I want to know why and nosey is an answer that just doesn't cut it for me. And on top of that, she claims that she looks at the one guys profile all the time because she grew up with the family during her childhood and she's seeing if any pictures were posted of them.

 Im not okay with this at all, I feel that there is something more. Maybe im looking into this too much but id like any insight that you guys can have for me.

 Thanks! 
Oh and by the way if the formatting sucks im sorry, on mobile. Also knocking back a few beers now too, so spelling might suffer too..

TITLE: My F(22) family didn't tell me my cousin M(30) was having a baby.

POST: I come from a small, dysfunctional family. I know every family is dysfunctional in their own ways, but perhaps a little more than most. Anyway, I really only have about 5 relatives. My parents (divorced), and my aunt and uncle and their 2 kids. And my grandpa. 

We're all pretty close and I spend my holidays with them. I live a state away at this point but try and keep in contact. My younger cousin and I are the same age and I consider her like a sister (I'm an only child). We grew up together, spent countless summers together, and even had similar friend groups as we grew older. I try to text her and call her but she rarely responds. Last time I saw her was in December 2014 and it was really fun. We always have a good time together and have good talks but when we're not together she disappears.

I called my aunt last week because there were some pretty big family problems I wanted to talk with her about but no one answered. She called me back tonight and we talked. She dropped the news on speakerphone that my guy cousin was having a baby. In January. It's October, so they've known for quite some time and chose to not tell me. 

I acted excited for him and asked a lot of questions, but part of me was so hurt and faking my excitement. I don't understand why they didn't tell me months ago. This is a huge thing to happen in my family (first grandkid) and I just feel left out. I'm pretty removed from my immediate family (have a bad relationship with my mom), so it sucks feeling like the only family I have doesn't care.

I obviously didn't want to make this announcement about me, so I didn't say anything but I'm having a hard time processing it. I've felt distant from them for some time, but I don't understand why the change and how I should proceed moving forward. I don't want to be bitter about it, but I don't want to put in effort if they don't seem to care.

Just mainly venting because I'm sad.

TITLE: I [20F] am experiencing something confusing towards my roommate [20F]. I've gone from being completely impartial towards her to something I can't explain.

POST: Hello /r/relationships, I'll try to keep this as short as I can.

Three months ago, I moved into a house in England with three other people from my country, 2 girls and 2 guys (including me). I had little to no attraction to either of the girls, one was too dull to talk to properly, and the other I had little attraction to. For the sake of this story, I'll call her Liz.

All four of us are on good terms, haven't had many problems or serious rows, so we get along well. Recently (a week or two ago), however, I started to become more and more attracted to Liz - we talked a lot, discussed quite a few things, and I understood why she was the way she was (which is to say a bit unusual, she's a bit strange at times with how she behaves). With that insight into her personality, I realised that although she's not stunningly attractive, I really, really like her. I haven't felt anything like this for a while, and I genuinely don't know what to do, or whether the feeling is mutual. Yesterday we were sat in the kitchen for hours discussing love, relationships, sex, all that, and I wanted to do something right then and there.

I will definitely talk to her about this, but it's a question of timing. She's leaving tomorrow morning - heading back home -, and will be back in just under a month. I don't think that now is the best time to bring this up, seeing as she's getting ready to leave, but I honestly don't know what to do.

TL;DR:","  I've started to develop feelings for my roommate, who's leaving soon. Should I bring it up now, when she's returning, or wait until after she leaves?","  Moved in with roommate, thought little of her, then recently realised that I have become really attracted to her, but don't know what to do."

TITLE: Me [16F] with my boyfriend [16] - Problems with Arguing

POST: Me and my boyfriend were together for 4 months before we broke up because we argued too much. It had been 1.5 months since we broke up and I decided to contact him again seeing as I was still madly in love with him and missed him so much. It took a while to 'convince' him that we wouldn't argue any more but eventually we got back together. A few weeks have passed now and we were literally so happy being back together; I thought he'd changed because now we talk more and see each other more and generally have fun. However, sometimes he doesn't speak to me for days on end because he feels I'm 'moody' and doesn't want to 'start an argument' which is fair enough, however he doesn't understand that not speaking to me is one of the reasons I get annoyed and feel unwanted.

Anyway, we started arguing on Halloween and because I was playing hard to get I decided to text saying 'we both need to change otherwise it's not going to work' and he agreed and unfortunately we broke up yet again. I don't want this at all and I have messaged him a lot of times trying to talk to him and sort the argument out- however he doesn't understand and sometimes will not reply. I know he loves me and we both want to be with each other, however sometimes he can be a little too stubborn and will ignore me and not speak to me for long lengths of time. I want to be with him and 'moving on' is not an option. At this moment in time he is still ignoring my methods to talk to him and will not see sense. Is there anything I can do?

TITLE: Starting to question moving my money to a Wells Fargo IRA.

POST: I have some money from a former employer that was put into a 401k through Fidelity.  Long story short (partly because I'm not sure what the complete story is) the money in the 401k got moved to a cash account and was doing nothing but sitting there, and I want it doing something.

Both my father and grandfather have accounts with Wells Fargo, plus Wells Fargo has a location in my town with advisers.  So I figured this would be the way to go, I have family that seems to like them, and I can actually go in and talk to someone in person.

After a hassle of them seemingly not knowing how to transfer the money from Fidelity, I get to talk to the adviser, and he basically just suggests a mutual fund through American Funds, and seeing that I'm 31 years old recommended an aggressive plan (which is at least one thing that makes sense).  He gives me some pamphlets about American Funds, mentions that payment is a rate of 5.75%, and basically sends me on my way.

In trying to understand all of this, I came here and started reading through the info provided.  I'm seeing that apparently Vanguard has much better expense ratios and potentially no loads, so I'm starting to think I should get out of Wells Fargo asap.  It's frustrating not entirely knowing what I'm looking at, or where to find information.  Like trying to look on Vanguard's website briefly, and I'm not seeing all fund options, or what ratios or loads they may have.  Same with looking at these American Fund pamphlets.  I just feel like I'm still in the dark.  Then I read on here that investments depend on what your goals are.  My goals?  I don't even know what kind of goals I should be making.

I guess I'm just looking for some advise and more information.  It seems like there's just so much to learn and I can't seem to make any connections yet.

TITLE: My Friend is Slowly Being Killed By His Roommate, What Do?

POST: My friend needs your advice.

First off, We are college students at a Tech School in the Pacific Northwest. Our school does not provide dorms so we all have to get our own apartments while we attend.

At first his roommate, let's call him Bill, was a decent guy, kind of socially awkward, but he did his part and they all got along well. Over the last two years Bill slowly started letting the place go. He stopped washing clothes, he stopped cleaning dishes, he stopped doing nearly everything. He puts food in the fridge and forgets about it, hiding it in the back or in the shelves.

Bill has piles of filthy laundry pushed against the wall. Stacks of molding plates, glasses with spoiled milk, bags of month old snacks,   half eaten take out surround his bed. Their apartment smells like a landfill, their windows and door have to stay open to ward off the smell.

About three months ago, when semester started again I noticed that my friend, Bob, developed a cough. I figured it was back to school sickness and would go away; it didn't. About three weeks later I took Bob to the urgent care center. They said his cough was caused by some sort of contaminant, that he must have been breathing it for quite some time. And that because of it he had developed a mild Asthma.

Fast forward two months, Bob is still coughing, Bill is still living in his filth. Bob wants to kick him out but is afraid that Bill will not be able to find somewhere to go. He wants to torment Bill, to make his life as 'uncomfortable' as possible. Bob's end goal is to make it so Bill decides to move out and saves him the hassle of forcing him out.

She needs personal space when she is streesed and I need companionship. 
We couldn't give the other what they needed to help cope.

We fought a lot. We both wanted to give the other what they needed, but struggled too. This caused even more stress. 
When time were good they were amazing though.

Then we decided to end it. Nether wanted to but we both thought we should.

Since, I can't stop thinking about her. Today was her birthday and all I wanted was to be with her. i miss her smile and laugh and company so much.

Sometimes however she will start jumping on him, trying to roll him and then force him down and when he starts snapping she will growl. At this point I will break it up.

She will also follow him everywhere and sometimes try to put her head on his back. He will snap at her when she does this.

Is there something I can do to help them play better together?

TL;DR:",  2 year old Shiba Inu male and pit female. She exhibits some behaviors that make me concerned. Is there something I can do to help them play better together?,  Foster pit is alpha rolling my dog and it starts to escalate. What can I do to make them play better together?

TITLE: Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 2 ½ years, not sure if I should be worried about weird FB post...

POST: Okay, so my boyfriend tells me he is ping away for a week with his family to a remote location where there is no cell service or wifi so he won't be able to talk to me until he gets back. This is totally fine with me because we only see each other every couple days as it is and we aren't constantly talking to each other anyway. However, I was  on Facebook after he had left on his trip and a friend of his who lives near me posted a picture of him at a party with her. Considering he's supposed to be in the middle of nowhere, I'm a little confused? Our relationship is pretty solid and I like to think if he just wanted to go party or something without me or if he needed space that he'd just say so but now I'm not so sure? Should I ask him about this Facebook post? Thanks for any advice in advance :)

TITLE: TIFU by riding a bike with a broken seat that almost cut my balls off

POST: I was 9 years old and during a time my brother used to take me with him to spend the afternoon at his friend's house. There was this guy who had a house with a big ramp that goes to the garage (which was also the main floor of the house).We would ride a bike as fast as we could all the way down the ramp until the front tire hits a wall (not very clever I know, it was hell fun tho).  
It turns that we only had this old bike with a broken seat - it didn't have anything covering it up, so the three tiny irons that work as the structure were exposed.
After riding the ramp a couple times I noticed that something went wrong. At that moment, I only noticed a small cut on my thigh. But I started to feeling that there was *something else* . I was afraid of finding out what actually happened and I was feeling really embarrassed to ask for help (I thought my brother's friends would make fun of me or something). So I stayed behind a small wall near the gate while they were playing on the street (I didn't have a plan, I don't know what I was doing lol). Then a neighbor sees me there, hiding and crying. She immediately tells my brother about it, I don't say what is going on so he takes me home. Once mom gets home I have to tell her. When she looks at it she got desperate and 30 min later I am at the emergency room getting 9 stitches on my scrotum. 
I got a Y-shape scar.

POST: Hello!

I am a 17 y/o who lives in the UK and work as a web designer for a small company (10-15 people). Naturally there's not really anything going for me at the office and I would really like to meet some girls my own age.

I had two relationships at school, the first lasting about 18 months each and I got dumped the first time (I still think about her a lot) and the second about 2 months, however I broke it off due to me missing my ex a lot.

I find it extremely hard to talk to people my own age, but find it easy to talk to adults that I've never met before, I don't really want to date an immature girl and would love to meet a geeky girl as I'm a geeky guy. 

I want to know how I can create a means to meet people my age, but hopefully more intelligent and mature girls, not the chavvy girls who seem to live near me.

TITLE: What is a good thing to bring to a friend in the Intensive Care Unit?

POST: Heya, about 2 weeks ago a good friend of mine was involved in a motorcycle accident that left him in critical condition with many broken bones and brain damage.  His condition has improved enough that his family has OKed (and encouraged) other visitors.  We aren't sure which part(s) of his brain have been affected (if there is any long-term damage), but here's what I do know:

* He is able to breath without a ventilator, and is using a mask.
* He is not paralyzed, but at the moment is still experiencing limited movement to his left side.
* He is able to squeeze your hand.
* He is able to make eye contact, although his eyes generally aren't open for more than a few hours a day.
* He has laughed at some conversations the family has had around him, and tries to speak but is not speaking coherently... it does seem that he understands what people are saying, though.
* He is able to sit upright.

He is moving from the ICU to the neuro department within the week, but it looks like he will be staying in the hospital for at least the next several weeks.

Have any of you been in the ICU yourself, or have had a family or friend in the ICU?  How did you help them pass the time, or feel cared for, or missed?  I want to be careful not to bring anything he can't interact with at this time.

We talked and she said I'm too clingy and jealous of our roommate [22] who is lesbian and only wants my wife and doesnt hide that fact.

 She said she wants to try again with us and apparently didn't think breaking it off meant divorce or that I would want nothing to do with her besides our daughter. 

She doesn't work and and my paranoia has me thinking the only reason she took it all back is because of the fact I am the primary income, our roommate refuses to pay more the 150 which isn't even 1/4 of our bills

The sex is gone, we rarely do anything together. It all started going down hill after the birth of our daughter, I don't blame her for the sex issue because I honestly beleive it is the birth control ""implanon""

POST: So I had a pretty hard day at work.  I babysit insane old folk, and the one today was a nightmare.  I had been holding in my pee for several hours before having an opportunity to use the restroom.  At this point, I'm tired and have a headache and just want to go eat something, so I'm running my piss break on autopilot.  My stomach is cramping from holding it in so long.  After pissing a minute, I think I'm finished, so I stand up to wipe, and then a surprise extra squirt of pee comes out.  It catches on my thigh and dribbles down my leg, soaking the upper part of my pants.

I had no spare pants, and had to walk around for four more hours after that, smelling like piss.  I wiped some liquid soap on it, hoping to mask the scent, and pulled my shirt down as far as possible.  Luckily, if anyone smelled anything, they'd just think it was the lady I was sitting and not me.

TITLE: I [18 M] broke up with my girlfriend [18 M] and I feel extremely guilty because she can't let go

POST: This is my first relationship, so all the things about breakups that I know of are entirely from asking around or reading up on it. I have no first hand experience.

I broke up with my girlfriend stating very plainly that although I still loved her very much, I couldn't see a future for us and I didn't want to prolong our relationship because every passing day will only make the inevitable separation that much worse.

She's a romantic, and told me during the breakup that while she wasn't going to stop me, she believed that there is only one special person for every person out there, and I was that for her. I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. 

I'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be. Hell, I'm afraid she might never actually let this go. I don't know.

I feel extremely guilty because she's begged me to come back since, and I told her a straight out no, because I didn't think the relationship would last long after this. It's only been a few days, and I'd say I've made significant progress recovering (it's been very tough though), but she hasn't turned up to school or spoken to many people. She only confided in a couple of friends and bawled her eyes out at them.

My friends told me that most breakups are one-sided anyway and it was inevitable that I'd be the asshole in the situation. But that's not really what I care about. How do I handle this? She still very much expects that somehow sometime I'll be running back to her. I've made my decision and I'm adamant that I won't, so how do I help her find ""closure"" without destroying her completely?

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] of 2 months, and parents are disapproving due to religion and distance and asked to end it.

POST: So I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two months. We are currently in a semi-long distance relationship (1 hour away) because she goes to school in LA (her hometown is 6 hours away from me). I drive to visit once a week and my mom was starting to get a little angry because she says it's a waste of gas and I should only visit her once every 2 weeks.

In addition, my parents had two conditions for me to stay with her (1. She converts to Catholicism and 2. She agrees to move to southern California if we get married). Now my mother told me that I had to ask this right away before things get hard on me later. 

I personally don't care if she converts or not because I respect her own beliefs and I know that she respects mine. However, I really love my family and it made my mom sad at the thought of me possibly moving far away from her in the future and that she is of a different religion. I know that she is scared that I will get hurt because a long distance relationship is pretty risky but I really love this girl. My gf is really easy to talk to and really makes me happy. I have never met someone that clicks with me like her and I know that she feels the same way. The thought of us ending without closure makes me sad and I do not want to give up. 

My gf said that she does not want to convert and that she does not want to be tied down on where to live in the future. She believes in just seeing where life takes her. 

I know my mom will get over the religion thing but I do not know how she will handle me possibly leaving my hometown in the future. I really do not want to end this relationship but at the same time I am scared because my parents will be disappointed in me if it messes up and I get hurt. 

I guess I am asking for some advice... Should I keep trying this relationship out and see what happens? Or should I just give up and move on.

TL;DR:",  Long distance relationship with girlfriend. Parents disapprove due to religion and distance and asked to end it. I love her but am scared of the potential for hurt if it ends.

TITLE: TIFU by Making a Girl Trip as She Tried To Return a Bag of Chips

POST: This story took place two years ago, a couple of months after the bike incident I had with another girl. This girl was just a friend. Being the immature teenage boy I was, I teased this girl. I remember meeting her and talking to her for a little while at an Interact service (A community service club in my high school). After a week or two with us going about our lives, I was walking down the hallway and she just saw me holding my bag of chips and was like ""You owe me chips,"" as a friendly gesture.

Again, me being the immature guy I was, I played along with it. Whenever I saw her in the hallway, I would be like ""You owe me chips!"" and she would say ""No, you owe me chips wtf."" One day after school, I started doing this in front of her friends and embarrassed her. She thought I was just being funny and enjoyed it. One day, I bought myself a couple bags of chips and I tried giving one to her, but she rejected. Although I was pretty persistant about giving it to her, she still said no. Now that I think about it, even though she said no playfully, I now know that she was getting pretty damn annoyed.

The next day during lunch time, I walked by her table and threw the bag onto her lap. I kid you not, this girl got up and started booking it to me with the intention of trying to give it back to me, so I went along with it and started a chase. After maybe like 50 feet, I hear a slam on the ground. I look back and I saw that she ate shit, in front of 70+ other people. Her three-week old phone cracked, elbow scrapped, knee bleeding. Yeah, it was a pretty bad fall.

I walked her to the nurse's office, embarrassed as hell and expecting her to yell the shit out of me, but she didn't, thankfully. I helped her clean up her wounds, bandaged them, and apologized. Since then, she hasn't said a word to me and just ignored me when she saw me. I had no game in high school as you can tell by my previous posts.

TL;DR:","  Tried to make a girl trip by giving her chips, she rejected, I chased her and she ate shit in front of 70+ people.",  Girl tripped and ate shit as I tried running away from her as she tried to return me a bag of chips. High school was a time of immaturity and innocence.

TITLE: Girlfriend says it's a red flag if I have any friends who I *might have dated had I never met her*

POST: M27, F25. The title basically sums it up. We've been dating 5 months. I care about my girlfriend (""Jane"") a lot, but I'm exhausted by how jealous she can be sometimes. 

I would say that 70% of my friends are girls, but my two closest friends are guys. The other day, Jane and I were together and a friend of mine walked by. I said hi to her like I do with all my friends, but later Jane said that my face ""lit up"" when I saw her and that I was obviously attracted to her. I denied being attracted to the friend (I am not) and tried to change the subject because this conversation has never ended well. 

She started a line of questioning.

Jane: In a hypothetical universe where you had never met me, would you have dated ""friend?""

Me: No.

Jane: But you obviously think she's pretty.

Me: Why does this matter? There are lots of pretty people in the world.

Jane: So you do think she's pretty.

Me: Do you think she's pretty?

Jane: Yes.

Me: Fine, she's pretty.

Jane: So you're attracted to her.

Me: No, please don't put words in my mouth.

Jane: Obviously you'd date her, and that's not okay with me.

etc...

I've never cheated on her nor would I. At the moment I don't see how these hypothetical scenarios could ever be good for a relationship. At the same time, I want to be sensitive to Jane's feelings. 

I have told her how I feel about this.

TITLE: [22/m] 4 year relationship with poor physical attraction to partner (21/f). Attracted to others.

POST: My girlfriend and I are both 22 and have been together 4 years. We go to different colleges and it has taken its toll on our relationship. We're in the process of applying to medical school and the idea that we might be very far apart come summer 2014 is scary. There is still love in our relationship and we deeply enjoy each other's company, but the sexual aspect/physical attraction is much weaker than in the past. The lack of sexual attraction (for me) is due to significant weight gain on her part. Long story short: We were both VERY fit. She gained weight (from birth control and less exercise) and I have stayed relatively fit. Despite gently discussing the lack of attraction, she has kept the weight. At this point, the relationship feels very much like a friendship with mostly unsatisfying sexual encounters (for ~3 years). We care for each other, but the passion seems absent and we are worried about the future.
 
*Enter attractive friend*. Since the sexual aspect has been poor for awhile, I have become increasingly drawn to other women. I have never and will never cheat, but the physical attraction to my friend has become much greater than with my girlfriend. I can resist her (she is also attracted to me), but I just feel physically unsatisfied. 

I feel like a douchebag for being interested in another girl, but I have also been clear with my friend that I will never cheat. That is understood and she has not tried to make any further moves on me. We are considering ""taking a break"" for a month to see how unbearable it would be to be apart. I feel confused about my attraction to my friend and lack thereof (but love) for partner.

**Another detail:** I basically had a girlfriend for 3 years, was single for two months, and went into this relationship (again, 4 years).

Feel confused about attraction to friend and lack thereof for partner. Should we take a break?,  4 year rela with poor physical attraction and future problems. Attracted to other girl.

POST: The problem is: 

He has trust issues. He says he trusts me, but that he doesn't trust the guys around me. And although he trusts I won't cheat on him, his qualm is that I like any type of attention I can get from guys. I'm around more people more than he is because I'm still in college and yes, I do get attention from college aged guys at work, school, social media etc. 

He's particularly jealous of a co worker in his 20s who happens to be really fit and my math buddy whom I study with sometimes. Last week, when I studied with my math buddy he kept asking me several questions about our hang out and I became annoyed to the point at which I told him that if he didn't trust me he was going to ruin the relationship. 

I also told him I had looked up articles and was starting to wonder if this was a red flag trait of a toxic relationship. He then told me he wanted to trust me and he wanted to work on his trust issues and to be supportive of him. I did reassure him and say I wouldn't trade him for any of these guys because he is special to me. He does however, admit he has these trust issues and is willing to work on it.

TITLE: TIFU by giving an orgasm to my gf

POST: This FU didn't happen today but it's not like the title says otherwise. Anyway it was last summer.
My girlfriend had recently moved in with me, like, a month before this story happened. It was a nice Sunday, so no work. Plus, it was my birthday. If you do the math, (sunday+birthday+just-moved-in girlfriend) you can see why I was expecting some sex.
So when I heard ""Happy Birthday"" and I saw my girlfriend with a really naughty lingerie, I was pretty happy. Anyway, we get going. It was the best sex we had ever had. I saw she was about to have an orgasm, so I started going faster. When she reached the climax, one of her leg started shaking. I'm not gonna lie, it was really hot and I felt like the god of sex. I was basking in my abilities, when all of a sudden 

**""MEEEEEOOOOOOOW""**

It was incredibly loud and it scared the crap out of us. Apparently my gf had kicked over a lamp with her leg, and that cockblocker of our cat decided *that* was the perfect time to crawl out the bedstand he was hiding under. The falling lamp knocked him out. He wasn't moving at all, so we got up and started dressing. While my gf called the vet (who thankfully is a close friend and lives quite near), I checked the cat: i could feel his pulse, so I put him in his transport cage and then we rushed to the car.
Halfway there, and, thank God, the little bastard woke up with the cutest meow.
We arrived at our friend who checked him and reassured us everything was okay. My girlfriend spent the rest of the day hugging the cat and crying. Since then, before having sex I have to search for the cat and lock him out of the room, which can kinda kill the mood

Ohio, and for those of you who don't know, foundry work is some of the dirtiest, nastiest, toughest work around.  10 hour days are the minimum around here, and guys routinely log 60+hours a week like it's no big deal.  We've got one crew who averages 13.5, 6 days a week.  If it's 90 degrees outside, it's 140 next to the metal.

Anyway, it recently came to my attention that one of the guys around here is illiterate.  Straight up, can't read or write.  He rides his bicycle about 18 miles (one-way) to get to work if he can't find a ride.  He's in his early 50's, prepares molds for finishing, and drinks a case of PBR every single night.  That's ALL I know about this dude.

So I got to thinking:  How the hell does he survive?  So much of society today depends on basic reading and writing skills.  I don't want to ask him because I think it'd be a phenomenally rude thing to do, and in my experience people that can't read or write get pretty defensive about it.

I'm over the fact that he never picked up these skills earlier in life.  Whether he's stupid/lazy, has a learning disability, or just had a set of circumstances that prevented him from getting this basic education.  I've put that from my mind and am now just trying to wrap my head around how he operates in the world.

How do people like this sign a lease?  Buy things in stores?  Manage money? Navigate to a new place? 

Now, immigrants who don't speak English and mentally challenged people are a different case. Usually they've got a support network to fall back on, or someone to watch over them.  As far as I know, this dude is on his own.

So Reddit, any insight, or anecdotes about people you know in the same situation?

TL;DR:",  I work at a foundry and one of the guys there is illiterate.  How does he survive in society?  Any insight or anecdotes about people you know in the same situation?,  I know a dude at work who can't fucking read or write.  How does he survive in the real world on his own?

TITLE: What in your boyfriend's or girlfriend's sexual history makes you uncomfortable?

POST: So I recently started dating a girl that I like a lot, and for the most part everything's going great.  The other night we had the 'dating history' talk that seems to pop up when relationships start getting serious.  After I briefed her on my (admittedly meager) tally of sexual partners, I expected to hear something close to my own experience (she's 21).  Instead she dropped a number that I didn't expect, given what I know about her.  Not quite double-digits but on the margins.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since, and it's driving me crazy.  It's not an extremely high number and I like to think I'm open-minded about sex, but the fact that this has been consuming me makes me realize how many hang-ups I still have.

So, Reddit, what in your partner's sexual/dating history makes you uncomfortable or upset?  How did you manage to get past it?  And has anyone been in a relationship where you've lived in blissful ignorance of your partner's past?

TL;DR:","  Starting dating a girl, expected to hear something close to my own experience, instead she revealed a very low number of sexual partners.  What in your partner's sexual history makes you uncomfortable or upset?","  Girlfriend has been with more guys than I anticipated, and it has mind-fucked me.

TITLE: I have read the FAQ, but I still have no idea what I am doing. Sorry for the stupid questions!

POST: Just wanted to say sorry again for wasting your time helping me out! I know I'm probably blind or something. >.<

I read the FAQ, and I was able to do some of the things to get started but many of the things I am still confused on. I was able to calculate my BMR (By the way is there one calculator that is better than the others? I got a few different numbers.) However, when I went to the link on the FAQ to calculate my BF%, the page was gone. Is this necessary? However, I know even without my BF% that I would be classified as ""skinny fat"" at 5'9 and 156 pounds with a decent layer of fat.

The next part I am confused on is diet. Most of the provided resources provide diets to try don't seem like they would lend themselves well to everyday/lifetime eating. I don't know how to eat healthy. The last time I tried to truly get in good shape I did it all wrong. I'm talking eating only 800-900 calories a day, counting obsessively, cutting out all my favorite foods, and interspersed with bouts of binging on aforementioned foods. Today, counting calories freaks me out because I fear that I will go back to that. 

I am trying to get into real fitness, like going to a gym or bodyweight fitness, but I cannot afford a gym membership and I can't seem to find something study enough to use as a pullup bar for bodyweight. What are my other options because I do want to build muscle.

My final question is that I have no idea what I am truly aiming for. I want to lose my layer of fat and build muscle, but I am not sure if there's a goal weight involved or what sort of time table I am looking at or how many calories I would need to eat. This brings us full circle as I restate that I have no idea what I am doing.

TL;DR:","  Read the FAQ, was able to do some things to get started but many of the things I am confused on. I want to lose my layer of fat and build muscle but I am not sure what my goal weight is.",  Not sure how to even sort of begin other than showing up here. Need loads of questions answered that I couldn't seem to find. Sorry for the inconvenience!

TITLE: Me [33 M] with my wife [31 F] 7 years, can't find happiness in our relationship

POST: To start, I love my wife and want her to be happy, but I am not.  We have a son, who is honestly the reason we got married, that we both love dearly.  We were living together for two years before we married, but at the time I was dealing with real self confidence issues.

When we got together I was barely making 40k a year, which is pretty respectable in hindsight for a mid-20's single Midwesterner.  However I poured myself into my studies and work and now have a master's and make over three times that.

The issue I have with our relationship is while I am driven and always looking for something new to learn, she is the opposite of that.  I've attempted several times over the years to get her back to school (she dropped out before she met me) or to get a job (hasn't had once since being with me), or to get involved in the community, she refuses.  She says she has no interest in those things.  She is constantly asking and dreaming of travel, new places to eat, and constantly fills our families weekends with so many activities I don't have time to do the chores she hasn't done.

To make matters worse, she really has no interest in sex since our son was born.  She's so afraid of another child that it's destroyed her libido.  I've tried to talk to her, ask her what she wants, what would make her comfortable, but all I ever get is ""I'm just not interested anymore"".

I'm not perfect, I try to be patient with all of this, but I do end up angry because I feel resentful of how relatively easy she has life compared to the hours and sacrifice I put in to provide everything.

So the question is this: Am I really a horrible person for wanting to get a divorce?

TL;DR:","  Love my wife, but she doesn't love me back.  We have a son who is the reason we got married, but she doesn't want anything serious.  Am I a horrible person for wanting a divorce?",  Two people whom probably don't belong together had a kid and got married.  One became successful and wants to leave the complacent one despite still loving them.  Wants to try to resolve the heaping guilt.

TITLE: TIFU by Pretending to like a girl I didn't have a crush on

POST: Throwaway account for reasons Im about to explain..
Like other TIFU posts, This happened to me about a month ago now.

I'm a pretty quiet guy, usually sits with some classmates from the same program in the resource center and always have a friend who tries to talk me into contributing to the conversational talks. Now here's where the TIFU comes in, the people at the table were talking about who they liked, had a recent crush on etc. For some reason I got it in my head to tell them I had a crush on someone (I didn't actually, I just wanted to contribute to the talks ._.) I tell them I liked, let's call her 'Amy' in the other stream of our program, who I think is actually a really cool,sweet girl,sociable,friendly and she even sits with us most of the time for lunch, except today. Everyone at the table is shocked that I liked someone, even more surprising that it was a girl (They were under the impression I was..like 'THAT' I'm not.) I end up having to ask Amy out for a coffee. (Here's where the SECOND FU comes in) I asked THROUGH FACEBOOK CHAT with everyone looking over my shoulder to make sure I HAD asked her, It becomes marked as 'READ' as they're eagerly awaiting a reply..Minutes pass and my friend 'Lisa's"" phone immediately goes off a few minutes later, it's 'Amy' texting her that I had just asked her to go for coffee. Amy immediately tells Lisa she only thinks of me as a friend, to which Lisa read the text out-loud at our table and everyone sat down from the awkward quietness after which I'm sitting in my seat in embarrassment as everyone tries to feel sorry me for about the outright rejection.

The next day, Im walking to a morning class and bumped into her in the hallway and failed to realize ahead of time how awkward I made things since we sit at the same table because we were like deer caught in the headlights. I went through the last two weeks of the semester avoiding her after this. (we used to just wave or say hi).

TL;DR:","  Pretended to like a girl I didn't have a crush on at a program I regularly attend, everyone saw and it was awkward the next day.","  Tried to contribute to a conversation with classmates, Told them I liked a girl I didn't actually like and got rejected by said girl all at the same time, made things awkward with said girl."

POST: So I met a guy in this city that I moved to for college, I find him EXTREMELY attractive physically, and VERY attractive personality wise, though his political views are opposite mine and he's a little less mature than I usually go for. When he first gave me his number we texted A LOT, mostly because I kind of thought we were flirting, but later he said he was like that with all his friends. I said it was fine because he ships out for USMC boot camp in January and I've been there done that with marines. We've spent some time together since then and I've decided I like him, but it seems like he's just not really interested in anyone at the moment (except for MAYBE his ex). So now I'm moving back to my hometown and I'm just wondering if I missed an opportunity, if there ever was an opportunity, or if I haven't passed the point of ""fuck it, ask him out, see what happens.""

TL;DR:","  Met a guy, really like him physically and personality wise, but he's not really interested in anyone right now except possibly his ex.

Recently, our grandmother (uncle's mother) has tried to get into contact with us again. I cut off a huge swathe of my family during the trial – essentially everyone who was not explicitly on our side – and my grandmother was part of that. Grandmother wants to make amends for her ""ambivalence,"" and that she is not talking to my uncle.

Cousin loves Grandmother and was upset when I cut contact with her, even when I explained the situation, and I want to do right by him. But I do not trust her at all. If my uncle even finds out a smidge of information about Cousin, I will not be responsible for my actions. We do not live in a state with grandparent visitation rights, so I am not worried about legal repercussions, but I don't know how to approach anyone on that side of the family.

TITLE: I've [24F] ruined my friendship with [23M]. I don't know what to do

POST: **Background**: we were friends for a long time and talked a ton, every day. Things started to get romantic between us, he was very enthusiastic but often got sad about us being in different cities. Then certain circumstances come up, making it so our long distance situation is extending -- so he put our relationship ""on hold"" until we're near each other again. 

I asked if we could just have fun this summer instead of being so serious about everything; he said he doesn't want just fun and wants something more long term with me, but knows him and long distance are a recipe for disaster. Okay, fine! I ask if our friendship will be okay. He's all ""I'M fine with continuing to be friends... do YOU think you'll be okay with being friends? *I* still want you in my life but if you can't do it that's okay."" Reddit, I'm really good about moving on from romantic situations and I assured him that I just wanted our friendship to be back to normal. But...

**Current issue**: After we decided to put the romantic part on hold he said that our friendship would be just fine, but it's been the opposite. I tried to act as if the whole situation never happened but would get either one word or no responses to our usual platonic texts -- even if he was the one initiating the conversation. I gave in and asked twice if everything was okay, but he snapped both times saying he doesn't want to talk about it even if I do, and that he's fine. But things don't seem fine at all! Am I nuts?

TITLE: TIFU By Taking Drugs at Work

POST: So, I pulled a total bonehead maneuver today. Background: I take pills daily for blood pressure, cholesterol, acid reflux and Parkinson's. Most of them I take around 5, after I'm home from work. Two of the Parkinson's I have to also take when I wake up at 5, then at 9 and 1. Usually, I fill up the Pill daily box on Sunday night. But I was feeling lazy and I had missed the evening of Saturday and the afternoon of Sunday, so I had two doses ready to go. I figured I'd take the morning dose from one of those and refill for today, then do the whole week tonight. So, I'm up at 5 but not awake. I take the morning dose fine, but when I went to fill up for the missing daily does for today, I find a bottle of carbo/levo in the Target bottle.
So wait, there's more setup. Target fills the prescription with non-generic but I have switched to the mail pharmacy my health plan likes cause I get three months for the price of one. The Target bottle pill is smaller and a white table so I think, that's what the real thing should look like. What the heck, I have to use up those, so I put in it. And that's the one I take at 9 a.m.
The problem, Target does sell me my Ambien prescription and it puts it in the ""You're Never Going to Open This Sucker"" bottle. I had gotten tired of opening that bottle, so I put it in a all-used up carbo/levo bottle. I don't take my sleeping pills daily, just when I need them, so I know they're kept beside the t.v. Well, I know when I'm awake.
I took the pill while I was on a email call, which aren't too hard, but I find myself losing focus. I get off the call and I get my review with my lead who has since moved on to another position so it's been a while. I'm feeling sick and falling asleep. I leave work wondering what the heck is wrong with me now and don't remember the bottle switch till I'm on the bus.

TL;DR:","  Took Ambien at work, switched to carbo/levo pill instead, lost focus and fell asleep while on a call, wondering what the heck is wrong with me now","  Ambien makes you sleepy, is not a proper replacement for carbo/levo and phones can be heavy machinery under the right conditions"

TITLE: Toddler deliberately peeing on floor

POST: 2.5 year old (at the time-- she turns 3 in September) was nearly potty trained, but fully regressed to diapers when her baby brother was born. We let it rest for a couple months, but have begun working on potty training again. She starts preschool in 5 weeks and must be ""potty trained or nearly potty trained,"" otherwise she will be forced to leave. We got an amazing deal due to a need based scholarship, and so being kicked out would be very problematic, as we can't really afford preschool anywhere else (and I work part time so we need childcare regardless).

She has been doing well with potty training again-- poops and pees on the potty if we remind her, but she also will pee in her pull ups all day long and not even notice. So today we switched to full time undies so she'll notice when she's wet. We were expecting accidents, but we weren't expecting her to *enjoy* them. She has had 3 accidents today, and each time says something like ""Uh oh, something's on the floor... It's... PEE PEE!!"" Very excitedly and with a big smile on her face.

We have been making her clean the mess up as a ""natural consequence,"" but she thinks that's fun so I don't know how much of a ""consequence"" it is to her. The third time, my husband sent her to her room, essentially punishing the accident... I've heard that you shouldn't punish a child for accidents, but he thinks she's doing it on purpose. I don't necessarily think she is-- I mean, maybe she is, but maybe she really is having an actual accident and just thinks it's funny. I don't know. 

She's very verbal and definitely understands that you *should* pee on the potty. She does notice when she has to go sometimes and successfully makes it to the potty. Other times we will remind her and take her to the potty, and she can pee ""on command"" upon sitting down. So I'm confident she is physically developed enough to potty train as far as communication and bladder control.

This is day one of undies, so I figured I'd get some advice here before we screw this up too badly.

TL;DR:","  Toddler peeing on the floor, we've been working on potty training and she has had 3 accidents today. Husband thinks she's intentionally peeing on the floor. How do we proceed?","  Almost 3 yo thinks it's funny to pee on the floor and enjoys the ""consequence"" of cleaning it up."

I woke up this morning to a text message telling me that a few of her close friends from her school, ""Dina"" and ""Jim,"" who are currently engaged, have invited the two of us to have four-way sex with them.

Now, I've always been interested in something like this, the idea of sex with a group has always turned me on. But, I'm not okay with other men being involved with Elise--in fact, the idea kind of makes me upset. So we preliminarily agreed to make it a kind of sex at the same time and place deal, where there will be no touching between the couples, but there is watching and talking between them.

Normally, I'd be very okay with this idea, but we've never done anything like this before and I don't really know Jim or Dina very well at all.

After my HS graduation, I went immediately to a Military Academy hoping to become a pilot.  I completed two years before having to leave last summer due to complications with an injury (can no longer serve/fly, but I am fully active, no real disabilities outside military life, etc).  I am now completing my degree at a well-respected liberal arts college.
 
At the moment, I am determining where to place my major and minor concentrations.  Due to the restrictions at my institution, I can either have 1. A major and a minor, 2. A major and two minors, or 3. A double major.
  
Between International Relations, Economics, and Computer Science (I am at the point in my college career that I can make any of these 3 fit into one of the above listed configurations without delaying my graduation. They are all of interest to me.), which should I place where and why? (for example: International Relations major, minors in the other two…. Economics and Computer Science double majors, dropping the IR… Computer Science major with IR and CS minors… etc.)

TITLE: Caught wife dirty-texting with co-worker.  How do I get past this?

POST: 41M, married 2 years to 35F.  She's pregnant and had started a new job when we found out a few months ago.  

About 6-7 weeks ago we were sitting on our couch talking and she gets a text asking if she's the type of girl that likes to ""make love"" from a number I didn't recognize.  I busted her then, she peddled bullshit for a bit but eventually admitted the whole thing and said she would stop.  I wanted to believe her so I did, but my trust was shaken.

About a week later I noticed she wasn't messaging me during the day as often as she had been and wasn't responding in her normal, flirty way.  I popped into her IM account (we each have each other's passwords) and saw a slew of messages between the two of them.  I let this go on for a few weeks, for a few reasons: while she was definitely flirting with him, she constantly reminded him she was married and would never do anything.  I believed she would be faithful even if she was playing out of bounds.  He kept pressing, flattering her and teasing, and they started having lunch together a couple of times a week.

Then last Friday she crossed the line.  They went out to lunch and she got tipsy on a glass of wine, and when they continued their IM conversation later in the day she finally relented to his teasing and told him she had fantasized about sucking his cock or being taken from behind by him.  When I picked her up that night, I immediately confronted her about it and we talked it out.  She agreed not to continue and I really, really want to believe her, but it's driving me nuts.  She cried, she apologized, but I don't trust her anymore and I'm not sure I'll be able to continue in our marriage.  Help me fix this, Reddit.

TL;DR:",  caught wife dirty-texting with co-worker.  She admitted it and promised not to do it again but I don't trust her anymore and it's putting a strain on our marriage.  How do I fix it?,"  wife has been IM'ing with a co-worker after she said she'd stop, then she crossed the line between friendly flirting and pursuit."

POST: I have been with my SO for five years. It's been an amazing relationship in parts but unfortunately our long-term goals do not align (they haven't for years and we just pushed it under the carpet and said love can overcome everything) and neither of us are willing to compromise. That, and we just argue over insignificant things which just highlights our incompatibility.

Anyway, we graduate this year and after the summer it will be over. It's been half a decade of our lives that we're just going to throw away. My gut instinct tells me that it is the right thing to do and that we'll be happier with other people. So I want to go ahead with this. But how do I push past all the doubt and the guilt and move forward without looking back?

TITLE: What would you do if an ex SO lied to you from the begining of the relationship and knowingly gave you AIDS?

POST: Throw away because this is relevent to me.  I found out my ex lied to me about several things from the begining of our relationship.  So this morning I went and got tested for all STDs the results don't get back until NLT Monday.  All I do right now is think the worst, and waiting until Monday is stressing me out.  All I can think about it is this crazy story I've made up in my head.  Now a little background, I'm 22 I have some rather big plans for my future and someday having a family is a high priority amoung those plans.  I would never dream of hurting anyone, I work with young kids at a taekwondo school in my town on a regular basis in addition to my big boy job.  But for whatever reason, I keep picturing getting the results back and them being positive for something uncureable and killing all of my future plans, effectively ruining my life.  I then go to confront the ex about it and find out they knew the entire time and knowingly gave me an uncureable terminal disease (I know AIDS isn't technically terminal itself and you can live a long time with it if you stay healthy, but what the hell is the point if you can't achieve your goals with it?).  As you might be able to imagine, my blood goes to instant boil at the thought of losing my future because this insolent fuck took it upon themselves to lie and cut my own life short.  I don't know if I would actually be able to do it, but the scene that continues plagueing my mind is, after hearing that my ex knowingly gave me this, I brutally kill them with a knife and accept whatever consequences ensue.  But after my blood cools off, I feel like shit for even thinking about doing it.  I'm stressing out like a mother fucker. >: /

TITLE: How do I [25/F] go about this when he [29/M] has his heart set on somewhere else?

POST: He is from the Northeast and I am from the South. We started dating December 2012. He is here in the South for medical residency. We got along so well. Had so much in common, laughed at everything, and always wanted to be with each other as much as we could. We just clicked right off the bat. Then we had a misunderstanding in February 2013 and we parted ways.

2 months go by and I contact him again because I still had feelings for him and wanted to know how he was doing. I didn't expect him to agree to hang out with me again but he did. We hung out and picked up right where we left off, laughing, joking, teasing and flirting with each other. Later that night he makes the first move and kisses me and then asks to see me again.

He hangs out with me all day the second time. We are now holding hands and freely showing affection. During this time I find out he has his heart set on living in the West Coast and that he will be in Europe for a month. He then asks me to hang out for the third time.

We hang out the third time and I'm trying to figure out how I was going to tell him I had feelings for him still since he was leaving for Europe the next day. I also saw certification paperwork in his luggage for the West Coast, which I probably wasn't suppose to see. So later that night I tell him how I feel and I'm crying because I'm upset. He feels the same way about me and is tearing up too. Tells me ""I don't know what is going to happen between us, we should keep in touch and you can visit me wherever I am."" He leaves the next day and says ""I miss you and I'll be thinking of you.""

I know we didn't date for long but I wouldn't depreciate it because it was short. When you know, you just know. I feel like he'll be the one that got away. I just feel like a month away from someone is enough to make him forget about me.

TL;DR:",  Guy I really like is leaving for Europe soon. He says he misses me and will think of me whenever he is away. How do I go about telling him I still have feelings for him?,  Got in touch again with a guy I had been dating earlier this year because I still had feelings for him.

POST: I don't want to go into too much detail, but enough that you guys can make out what my dilemma is.

I met her online (certain app). We live in the same city, we talked for a while, found out we have a lot in common, and she's extremely nice. We only text chat, we almost know nothing about how the other looks, and at this point we don't really care. Here are some of the problems I'm facing now:  
**1.** She's 16. I'm 20. There's an obvious age gap, and I don't know if it's completely ethical to continue trying to get with her.  
**2.** She's moving to her home country in less than a month. I only just got to know her and she's already moving away. It seems like she's completely fine with continuing to talk to me while she's there, and I don't mind that. But...   
**3.** She told me we can't meet face to face. I really want to meet her before she leaves. She said it's hard to do so here + her parents might not like that. I didn't want to insist, even though I had ideas on how to meet up in secret. I still really want to see her.

Sorry if there isn't enough info, I kinda rushed through this. I'm looking for advice on what to do. Is the age difference a problem? If not, what's my best course of action right now?

TITLE: Not sure if I [28M] should break up with my girlfriend [21F] of over one year because she never does anything for me.

POST: Hello all. I've been with my girlfriend for over a year now. I feel like I've done a lot of things for her. We traveled a lot, I take her different places all the time for instance restaurants, museums, show her new things, etc. 95% of the time I pay for everything and everything we do is my idea which I have no problem with. I buy her little presents here and there, when she is sick I bring her medicine/food/soup to her work without her asking. I do small things for her all the time.

However about 4 months ago, I thought about our relationship and I could not really think of a single thing she has ever done for me. I had a talk about it with her and her response was basically ""I'm a girl, I don't know what I should be doing."" So I told her, ""do little things for me from time to time, you don't need to buy me anything. Bring me lunch to work one day and surprise me, that will make me happy, it doesn't need to be anything major."" I may be a bit overreacting, but I feel that when you're in a relationship with somebody you should be doing things for them from time to time. 4 months have passed and nothing has happened.

We had another talk, and her response was basically similar to what she told me 4 months ago. I told her that I need to think about things and I haven't talked to her in 3 days. 

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, but I feel like my efforts are not be reciprocated in any way and I feel like this is a one sided relationship. She tells me that she loves me, which I believe, but at the same time I need for that love to be shown in some way. Not sure where to go from here, I was hoping she would change a little bit as the relationship progressed. I understand there's an age difference and that could be part of it, but I think she's old enough to know how relationships work.

TL;DR:","  Been with my girlfriend for over a year, everything is going great but she never does anything for me. Feel like the relationship is one sided and not reciprocated in any way. Should I break up with her?","  Girlfriend never does anything for me, while I take her to all kind of places and do small things for her. I feel like this is a one sided relationship."

TITLE: Me: 19[M] Her: [19F]. It's still over, right?

POST: All right, so there's lonely little me who manages to somehow arouse the interest of a pretty girl for awhile. She even kissed me a few times one night. Of course, over the weeks I managed to screw it up by being too afraid to be assertive and she started losing interest in me. She stopped being the first to text and would hardly respond when I texted her. And yes, after the night we kissed all we did was text each other for a week or two because we were probably both waiting for each other to be the one to take things further.

The people here told me I dropped the ball and it's over. They said she was being too immature to come out and say it's over, probably because she felt she was in too deep because she offered to take my virginity. But then I worked with that girl last night, seeing her for the first time since things went sour. As we left for the night, she gave me a hug, said I can come over with her and a coworker if I changed my mind (even though she never asked to give me a chance to say no in the first place which makes me suspicious), and told me to text her. 

Half an hour later I texted her saying I changed my mind and wanted to come over. She said the coworker (some weird guy 30 years older than us) was mad so she was leaving. Although she still could've been sitting on his couch chatting with him for all I know.

I need you guys to slap some sense into me. Because she hugged me and told me to text her, I have this little misguided sliver of hope. It's still over right, and she's still just too afraid to reject me? What do I do now? Do I text her now? What do I text her? She said she wanted me to text her, but I bet if I text her now I'll be getting one word and effortless responses like before.

I'm 22 years old, and have managed to drop my credit score to below 600. This started with a Best Buy Credit card that my 19 year old self ""knew"" I would be ok obtaining. I ended up unable to keep up with payments, defaulted, it went to collections, and I was eventually able to pay it off after a generous tax return, but not after taking damage from it.

Also, I am currently in a position where I am unable to make payments on my student loans, and I think this is what has wrecked me so hard. I pay my car, phone, rent, and credit card payments on time (my card is constantly maxed out as well) but my score stays low due to my student loans, which are about $7000 all together.

My reason for posting is this; What are some suggestions to getting back on track? I'm currently trying to save up to get my real estate license to bring in more money (I was offered a partnership with one of the top realtors in my area) But I'm really struggling to even put that much extra money together, which amounts to around $1400.

POST: Hey all, kinda new to this so I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing, but I was hoping for some help. Hopefully I've come to the right place.

So basically, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 months a few weeks ago. She was always really clingy and attached to me, even after I dumped her.

While I was dating her, I made a Tumblr account by her suggestion, which is where my problem lies. When I dumped her, I made it very clear that I didn't want hide nor hair of her in my life anymore. But, she never bothered to unfollow my Tumblr, and it makes me slightly uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. The first one is entirely my fault -since she's still following me, I can't help but to keep checking back on her blog. This makes it really hard for me to forget her, and let her go, because no matter how many times I tell myself to stop looking, 
I can't control myself. The other reason can't really be helped -even though I made sure she knew I don't want any part of her in my life anymore, she still goes through my blog and likes my posts.  

All of this makes me really uncomfortable, but I'm not sure how to go about dealing with it. Should I just block her? Confront her? Am I overreacting? Am I being the dick here? I really don't know, and some help would be nice.

POST: So this is a bit of a odd question, and a bit of a moral one as well.

A local company named ARC is in the Nashville area. They are similar to goodwill in the respect that they will pick up your clothes for a tax break.

The branch of the group here prints off yellow bags with their number here on the bag to call and schedule pick ups of the bags. (They employ mentally handicap members of society to do most of the labor of the company.)

They have put instead of their number on the bags, my cellphone number. In a slight defense to them it is only one digit off. However I'm receiving over 30+ calls a day from angry individuals wondering when ""their shit is gonna be picked up."" 

After speaking with the district manager who thought I was lying and making the entire thing up until she went and found the bag with the wrong number on it she offered to take my phone number and =>> HAVE ME PURCHASE A NEW ONE FROM MY PHONE COMPANY <<=

This did not set well with me.

TL;DR:","  A local company printed off 500,000 flyer bags and distributed them with my number.

TITLE: Me [25 F] with my ex [25 M] of 6 mos, this is letting go

POST: Dated my ex for about a year, we went on a few trips together, met each other's family and friends, and essentially lived together for a short period. I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.

I think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be. Thiiiis noob was always on my case about how I needed to be more assertive and secure in our relationship, but he didn't have the gall to do the same. He's an extreme people pleaser, and he's becoming a total beefcake who's been swept by the upgrade mentality. Patronizing jerk.

I used to swear that we were made at the same time (close bdays). And If I could go back, I would teach little me all that I needed to know in order to be ready for him to come along- after talking with some of my favorite revolutionaries, because this is all fantasy anyway. 

Now, I know it's not entirely my fault that I didn't wake up to some realities until it was too late to make a 180, but it still sucks knowing that I was left because of some bogus preconceived ideas. Change takes time. Breakthroughs don't happen over night, Einstein!

TL;DR:","  Was in a relationship with my ex for 6 mos, things were going great but the reality of life is catching up to us and we're not where we want to be. Breakup sucks.","  Ex came back after 6 mos to fill my head with nonsense and disappear, this is my reaction. More details in comments. Please reply if you've experienced problems with love or friendship that were related to outside forces."

TITLE: [22/m] Struggling with a strange relationship/non-relationship FWB thing [22/f]

POST: My best friend's girlfriend introduced me to a friend of hers on a blind double date setup a couple of months ago. That night went fantastic, we hit it off immediately, got a kiss goodnight, everything was looking up. We go on a few dates, walk in the park, dinner and a movie, etc and things continue to look up. The one problem we continued to have was not really communicating, we would not talk/sparsely talk for a week or more between dates, it seemed like we just didn't have a lot to talk about. We had sex, the sex was great, we both left extremely satisfied. But despite that, and the fun we had on dates, we continued to not really talk. Both of us, realizing this was strange, apologized for the lack communication and promised to improve. Yet we still kind of drifted apart I guess, meanwhile we still meet to have sex. I'm not sure who's fault it was really that we didn't talk as much as we should, probably mine regardless. So I broke it off,  so to speak, because I felt like we were both putting on a facade as far as the relationship side of things goes and I offered to continue our friendship. She was relieved to hear all of this as she was feeling the same way but she requested that we still be available to one another sexually if either of us was getting horny or whatever. We had an awesome productive conversation about it and agreed to be FWB for the time being. Fast forward a month and we have continued having sex once a week or so. Sex continues to be good. I know very well that she is not interested in more than a FWB relationship, and I remember a time very clearly when I honestly felt nothing toward her romantically but despite the logical side of my thinking telling me to move on, I feel an aching love-sickness especially now as her Ex is in town. I know that I should not feel this way, but I honestly cannot help but get that dreadful tight feeling my chest thinking about her with someone else. What do I need to do reddit? Any advice would be more than amazing, Thanks for reading.

TL;DR:","  Had a great FWB relationship with a girl, things were going great but she is now seeing someone else. Still love her but get a terrible feeling about the situation. What do I need to do?",  Blind date leads to attempted relationship which fails due to lack of communication and turns into a happy FWB situation. Apparently still have feelings for girl. What do.

TITLE: Is it wrong for me [32M] to skip my sister-in-law's wedding [26F] so I can go on a once-in-a-lifetime guy's trip with my friends? Wife [30F] not happy.

POST: I'll be honest. This wedding has been in the making for the last year, and the trip I want to go on is sort of last minute. I've never formally agreed to go to the wedding, but realistically it's always just been accepted as a given that I would be at the wedding since it is my wife's sister. 

One of my college buddies just recently told our group of friends that he's going to Australia in October for business but plans to spend an extra week there just kicking around and exploring. One thing lead to another and two friends from our group decided to join him. I've wanted to go to Australia ever since I was in college, but I never could get a group together. It looks like that's finally happening! The problem is that I'll have to miss my sister-in-law's wedding because it falls right in the middle of the week we're planning to go, and it wouldn't make sense to leave early or go late. It's an expensive trip, but I can make it work. I think it would be money well spent. 

Of course my wife is not happy about this, which I can understand. She's very close to her sister, so I can see why the wedding is a big deal to her, but I don't think she really understands my position. I like her sister, but we're not close. The same is true for her fiance. I have nothing against them, but the only reason I would be going is for my wife. Normally, I'd be okay accepting this, but I have a chance to go on an awesome trip with good friends that I don't get to hang out with that often. I think I'm justified in wanting to go and am being both reasonable and fair.

TITLE: Parents/College Students of Reddit: How did you deal with your/your parents' empty nest syndrome?

POST: I am leaving for college in about three weeks, and my mom is already freaking out quite a bit. In fact, she has been getting progressively more upset ever since I graduated from high school in June. I feel awful because I know that she's upset, but it's really starting to drive me up a wall. Some background:

* I am my mother's only child. After breaking up with my father, she eventually got married to my stepdad. They have decided not to have any more kids, though she does have two small dogs to nurture.
* As my mom has pointed out, I have been in her life longer than she's been without me. (My mom got pregnant at 17, and I'm currently 18.)
* My stepdad has a strange need to update me every time that my mom cries or gets upset about my leaving, and the guilt is really getting to me.
* Both my mom and my stepdad seem to have some jealousy over the amount of time that I spend with my boyfriend, which I find to be unreasonable because I'm usually out with him when they are at work or in the evenings, when they are tired and reading or sleeping. The guilt over this is also starting to get to me.
* I suspect that all of this is complicated by the fact that my college is about a 14-hour drive from my home.

TITLE: Tomorrow is my birthday [30M], and I'd rather just pretend that it didn't exist instead of my wife [28F] and friends doing anything about it.

POST: When you're a kid, you look forward to birthdays.  Your friends and family do something special for you, you get a few cool presents, and have something to eat.  

But now that I'm older, I'd rather pretend that my birthday doesn't exist.  I fear getting older and irrelevant, and hate knowing that my youth is behind me.  A few of my friends are around five years or so younger than me, and it's so cringe-inducing when I realize that they aren't familiar with the movies or music that I grew up with.  Turning 30 tomorrow is a milestone I'd rather not have to deal with.  I really am turning into a damn old man, at least mathematically, and I hate it.

I've always gotten kind of depressed in recent years when my birthday is coming up.  It reminds me that I'm drifting further into irrelevance, that my best youthful days are behind me, and that another year has passed without me doing anything great with my life.  I'd rather just not acknowledge it.    In my head, I'd prefer to think that I'm still 19 years old without a care in the world.  Of course, a 40 hour a week office job and a mortgage makes that impossible, but at least I can dream.

My wife brought it up last week and asked what I wanted to do for my birthday.  I told her I'd just like to have a nice drink at home and watch a movie with her or just grill out some burgers with our friends or something like that.  But I know that they've probably got something crazy planned since I'm turning 30, and I honestly just dread it.  I don't know how to approach it, and I'm already kind of a nervous wreck over getting older anyways.  I feel guilty about it because I know they mean well, which is kind of hitting me and making me even more depressed about the whole deal.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this?  How did you deal with a big age milestone?  Did it make you depressed too?  How do you suggest I go about this?

TITLE: My live-in partner of ~2 years [27M] and I [23F] have hit a rough patch. How do I know if it is time to talk about ending the relationship?

POST: My relationship with my boyfriend (~2 years) has been great. We have had a lot of fun together and we have been respectful and honest throughout the relationship. For the past month or so there has been a change. We are shorter with each other, we aren't as physical, and we seem to be generally less excited to be around each other.

I have been considering bringing up the end-of-relationship talk. However, I am incredibly unsure if that is even what I want or is best for us. This past month of lackluster relationship could conceivably be a rut that we need to wait out. I have been unemployed for three weeks and I know that I don't feel like the best version of myself. Maybe my own insecurity is being reflected in our relationship.

He gets home in a couple hours and we will have to talk about our unfinished disagreement from this morning. He didn't sleep well so I did the morning chores so that he could sleep in. When he did get up he was short with me because I didn't make the dog a raincoat and he swears he asked me to do it weeks ago but I had absolutely no memory of him asking. I was really surprised that we were disagreeing over a silly and easily rectified miscommunication and was hurt that he was blind to the ways in which I was actively trying to make his life easier. We didn't get to finish talking it out because he had to go to work. It just seems like there has been one silly disagreement after the other that we have to work out. We never let the little stuff bog us down before.

**So my question is this, r/Relationships-** How do I know it is time to start talking about the end of an otherwise loving relationship? Furthermore, how do you end a relationship well?

About 5/10 and I'm sleeping in the apartment alone, it's almost completely empty and ready when my ex GF's mom shows up with a sob story about how she's homeless just quit her job (making 2000+ a paycheck) and just needed a place for a few days. Well she had helped me in the past so I said yes. Over the next few days I finished my packing told my ex about her mom and told her to take care of it. 

Now here we are my ex said her mom would move in under her own name and that she would talk to the landlord and everything and my ex believed her, I told her no way is that true and asked her to please call the landlord, turns out her mom lied and it's still in my GF's name.

I'm really at a loss of ideas here is this even legal? As a side note she hired someone to break into and rob her last place a few months back then coincidentally while my ex was out of town her place was broken in to... Her mom called right away to let her know she would never do something like that....

TITLE: I [18/F] can't tell if my first date went well for him [21/M] or not.

POST: We met on tinder and we've been talking on and off for about 2 months now. We made plans in advance for yesterday and we agreed that it would be a date/hangout mix. He let me know in advance that these sort of things made him a bit nervous and that he's a little shy in person. He drove about 30 minutes to get here. 

So as soon as we met, we grabbed some dinner. With better lighting, I could see him more clearly and he was super attractive. It was about 8pm when we got in, and we literally stayed in the restaurant until it closed at 11 just talking. He paid for the meal while I was in the bathroom. After that, we decided to just drive around. I asked him if he had to be home at any time and he said it really didn't matter. 

The whole date was just a lot of talking and getting to know each other. Near the end of it there was a lot of humor and teasing. He asked me if this was one of my better Tinder dates, and I said definitely. I asked him if he would wanna meet again sometime and he said for sure. However, when the end of the date came (12:30am, my curfew),  and when we were sitting in front of my house, I was super confused with the body language. I felt as if I was being really awkward because I unbuckled my seatbelt and looked at him and lingered for a while. He did look into my eyes and at my lips a couple of times, but then he'd turn away and look out the window. We both awkwardly/nervously laughed.  I'm used to guys kissing on the first date it if goes well so I felt bad at this point and so I went home. Wasn't sure if he wanted to kiss or not so I didn't go in for it.

He texted me when he got home ""You're probably asleep, but, OH MY GOD. IM FINALLY HOME. Let's just say I'm stupid and made a very wrong turn lol""

Would he have made an excuse to leave earlier if the date was going badly? Do you think he's still interested?

TITLE: Me [25 F] can't get over boyfriend's past [25 M] relationship with his gf a year after they broke up

POST: I really love my BF, but he told me something about his past a while back and I can't get over it.

His previous girlfriend cheated on him right after they started to live together. It's been several years since then, but he at first told me that they never had sex in the year they kept living together. Then he came out and told me they had sex everyday and he was high most of the time living with her, trying ""everything but meth"".

I have gotten over it in some way by saying ""it was the drugs, it's not entirely his fault"". I am addicted to smoking and trying to quit, so I started vaping. I told him I didn't want him to do it too because it bothered me because I was worried he would do it as an escapist thing and it made me think about that past situation. I caught him doing it by the sound via skype and got really upset with him. He tells me I need to get over it, but gets jealous when I vape because a male friend gave me a unit (when I use his I hear the sound and get upset because I remember it). I just didn't want him to do it because I thought ""what happens if it's not enough""? It would just be a gateway for him to do other things, and since he was previously using a lot of drugs I get really worried.

I don't know if I am being too unreasonable. I just don't know how to get over it and it's killing me. I know it has nothing to do with me, but the fact that he was able to do something like that just drives me crazy. I don't know how to cope with this, but I do want to be with him.

TITLE: I don't know how to have friendships- or how to interact with people (F 19)

POST: Alright guys, so here's the deal. I am nineteen years old, and I've learned a lot this past year about things I need to learn in order to become a healthy, happy adult.

One of these things is coming to terms with the fact that my relationship with my family, especially my mother, has been emotionally abusive.

This lifelong relationship has basically fucked me up, and I have an incredibly hard time putting my trust in people. Hard to be vulnerable to anyone when you've been hurt so many times by your primary caregiver, y'know?

But I want to change. I want to change so that I can be happy.

I am INCREDIBLY lucky to have a boyfriend who is kind and loving and endlessly patient, and his unconditional love has made me try very hard to be the same kind of person to him. Seriously, I feel like I won the lotto. God is real, my boyfriend is proof.

Right now we are in a long distance relationship while he is off at college. I still live at home. My plan is to get my associate's degree, get a job, and get the heck out of here. 

I dream about a life where I am surrounded by loving and accepting people who I can count on and cry to. I'm so tired of holding things inside. I want people to cuddle with.

I WANT healthy friendships. But truthfully speaking, I am very, very scared. I don't know who to trust- I don't know how to gauge if a person is trustworthy or not. I don't want to get hurt anymore.

TITLE: Should I [21/F] ask the guy [24/M] I'm seeing to take down his ""single"" status on Facebook?

POST: I've been seeing a guy pretty consistently (about once a week) for around three months now. I'm pretty inexperienced in terms of relationships, and I brought up exclusivity way too early (at around the 4th date), because we started doing physical things, and I wasn't that comfortable doing them without exclusivity. When I asked then if he was looking for exclusive things, he sheepishly said, ""I don't know."" But then he said he really respected that I didn't want to do physical things without exclusiveness--that it was rare for this time and place... (um, ok.)     

     

Anyway, it seems like he's been leaning more toward exclusiveness in the last two months. When I found his okc profile, which he hasn't signed on to since Jan, he said, ""maybe I should take that down."" I think I shrugged in response, and said a half-hearted, ""yeah."" He also said, ""I'm not seeing anyone else, if that's what your'e afraid of.""      

Recently, I texted him, ""do you want to see other people?"" and he said, ""not necessarily. I mean, I'm not approaching people in grocery stores anymore."" (That was how we met...)      

I was like, ""ok,"" or something like that. I honestly don't even know if I want to be exclusive with him, it's just that things have gone further physically than I'm comfortable with without exclusivity. (I lost my v-card to him...) It's not that it means that much to me or whatever, I just feel like because it's the first time I've done it, I'd like some exclusivity.      
  
Sorry for the ramble! Anyway, I just wanted some opinions on whether it's reasonable to ask him to take down his ""single"" status on Facebook. Not to put ""in a relationship,"" but to just leave it blank.

He has a history of domestic violence when he lived with us (I had him arrested as a minor), and he has a history of domestic violence with her.  They are unmarried, and he is now threatening 'all out war' to get full sole legal custody of the child when she is born.  He is even pushing to break a restraining order, and get an early judgement on visitation and custody rules.  

He has threatened to retain a lawyer, which there is a 75% chance he can not afford to do and is using it as a stalling tactic.  A new restraining order hearing was postponed today when he said he was retaining counsel at the end of this week, and it has been pushed to mediation (for custody issues, not RO issues).

He's great at playing the system and the people that work inside of it.  I am all for getting her a lawyer to fight against this but I am wondering just what we're in for.

He will not be named on the birth certificate.  
There is no paternity test, just that they both agree it is his.
He has no stable support system or family to help him out.
She is surrounded by a supportive family, and his mother and myself.

Is he facing an up hill battle here to get visitation and possible custody, or is she?

My girlfriend and her parents got into a simple argument and my name was brought up as the cause for my girlfriend's ""negative"" attitude. My girlfriend later texted me saying she can't handle how her parents hate her because of their not liking me. She wants to break up with me because she can't pick me over her parents. I don't want to lose her, and she doesn't seem like she's fighting for us at all.

TITLE: M/28 dating 26/F. GF has trust issues with me. That Facebook stuff too...

POST: Never thought I'd be posting something like this but I'm at my wits end. 

Have been seeing the woman of my dreams for about 5 months now. Just flew 15 hours to meet her parents in another country and we had the best time ever. Our holidays were nice nice and everything was great.

Yesterday morning, my GF woke up crying to me, telling me she is crazy. And that I was going to kill her. I thought she had cheated on me or something horrible but it wasn't as bad as I had imagined. But still a shocker of what she admitted to me. 

She REACTIVATED my Facebook account. That means she had the password resent to my email address then logged into my Facebook after the new pswd was generated. So she could read my messages and whatnot. When she told me, I just stared at her and then kind of laughed it off, just because I didn't want to have a bad day before I had to go back to work the following. 

I was pissed inside. I knew she was insecure a bit but didn't think she'd do something like this. Just to clarify, I haven't given her any reasons to go snooping. I don't go out much. When I do it's once in a blue moon. I always answer my phone. I always text within a reasonable amount of time, and don't have randoms contacting me or anything sketchy to give her reason to be looking into me. 

I want to stick up for myself but don't want to ruin things by flying off the handle. In her defense she ""has to know everything and wants to know everything about me"".....which is fine, but I feel she is ruining something amazing between us. 

I don't want to distance us from each other but I feel betrayed and all that crap. I offered for us to see a counselor just to talk through things, but tha's pretty serious. But I am serious about her. 

What are your thoughts? I do love this woman and she loves me too, but I'm sad about this crap. Glad she admitted this to me prior to me finding out.

TITLE: 39/f, think IFU by having sex too quickly.

POST: I'm a 39/f who went without sex for 5 years following a painful divorce. I did not have any clue about how to date, and my confidence was so low that I didn't even feel like a woman any more. Soooooo, I got sick of being overweight and eventually lost 35 pounds. 

Met a great guy when renting a U-Haul (he owns the rental place) and he flirted with me. I didn't think anything of it cause I didn't think he could possibly like ME. Then, he asked me over to watch a game one night...and we never made it to the end of the game. He apparently liked my body even if I didn't, and I was on cloud 9. Went out a couple more times, then he inexplicably dropped off the face of the earth for 4 weeks.

  I was hurt, but took it philosophically and signed up for a dating site - I am very sexually oriented, so I found a few ""encounters"" and started to relax a bit and enjoy being single. 

Then, he called me up & we resumed a ?relationship? - and we truly like each other as people, but had sex every time we met (apparently strong attraction both sides)

Recently texted me & said he wanted more than just sex, and wanted to get to know me more. I said I wanted that, too. He then said that it would not be in my best interests to spend more time with him. Huh? What? My brain hurts. I asked him point blank if he wanted to break things off, and he said ""by no means!""

I like him lots, he is a good person, he has brought himself out of a lot of dark places, and I didn't expect to like him so much. 

I think IFU by having sex with him too soon. Is it fixable?

TL;DR:","  Had a great guy, but he said he wanted more than just sex. I think IFU by having sex too quickly. Is it fixable?","  I had sex with a guy on the 1st date, thought it was casual at first, but feel more now. He says he does, too. Is it too late to back up & have a do-over?"

TITLE: Me [19M] with my bestfriend[18 M] for life, is starting to date a girl that treated him bad in a past relationship.

POST: My bestfriend, lets call him Carl is a womans man. He's never really had any issue getting girls. Carl isnt a big fan of partying either, sometimes he likes it, sometimes he doesnt. What im trying to say is, he always has a girlfriend and thats just the way its been. 1-2 years ago he broke up with his gf and then he was single up until Januari where he started flirting and, not dating but very close to dating a girl in his class.

Ive met the girl and shes pretty and nice and everything, but i think she treated him rather poorly. Not in a abusive kind of way, but more taking him for granted just because he liked her. 

She got angry pretty quickly, and didnt like when Carl went out to party with us but she took every chance herself to go out and party. She never had any time for him but always had time for her friends and her partying.

This was about 2 months ago. She was at a party, me and carl was at a nightclub so it didnt really matter. Except she kissed a dude at the party. Not just a random dude either, but a guy that had been flirting with her for awhile. 

Morning after they had a fight and SHE ""broke"" up with him. He was ready to forgive her as long as it didnt happend again and everything. 

I told him to ignore her, just dont say a word to her, do absolutely nothing. He did, and now 2 months later she wants to get back together with him. 

My problem here basically is that i dont like her, i dont think she deserves Carl but, Carl really likes this girl and i just want my main man to be happy.

POST: First of all, I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate for this subreddit. I'll make sure to delete/repost if I get pointed  towards a better sub.

So my seven year old cousin is about to enter a new school. He's the kind of kid who bullies love to, well, bully. He likes things (shows and toys) that aren't exactly aimed for boys of his age.

I personally couldn't care less if he likes Batman or Barbie. But even though I think that kids will always be mean little demons and that teasing/moking is part of growing up, I don't want him to get targeted too much. I'd obviously prefer sparing him that.

Of course I don't want to tell him to just change how he is. Should I say something to him? Maybe tell his parents hoping they know what to do? (Which I highly doubt....)

TITLE: Me [16 M] with my Girlfriend (?) [17 F] for like a week, read comments (it's complicated).

POST: So I'm 16. I never thought I'd realize what people meant about how it sucks, but it does. I'm trying to juggle crew rowing, 3 APs, and a social life. The stress is high. Recently, a lot of my friends have been talking about how they've started making out with girls, and I got a little jealous. I WAS 16 and I'd never kissed a girl before, and to be fair I'm a tad nerdy.

   So yesterday I'm hanging out with my best friend, also 16 although he goes to a different school, and a good coxswain (someone who steers the boat) friend (girl), a senior at a different school than me. After I drop off my (guy) friend, I start driving her back home as well. Since we're actually good friends, we start talking candidly, and eventually the conversation moves to kissing and relationships (she broke up with her boyfriend.)

 
   Before I know it, I'm asking her if she'd ever kiss me, and she said only if I don't tell anyone. So we start making out for the next 10 minutes. But today (the next day), I'm in a bind. I've texted and snapped her a few times but she's hardly replied, and her and I are meeting up again this saturday for her birthday. But I'm worried for many many reasons.

1) I feel like we're taking things too fast and it'll just ruin what we have

2) Although she does reply, I have to initiate the conversation first. 

3) I feel like she's using me as a fuck buddy (she literally said she'd bang me saturday) until she can get a permanent boyfriend.

   Thoughts?

TL;DR:","  Made out with a girl, she said she'd only kiss me if I didn't tell anyone. She's meeting up with me again this saturday for her birthday.

TITLE: [FL] Moving out, roommates staying, I don't get my deposit back until everyone else moves out?

POST: So I am relocating to a new apartment in a few weeks and I'm trying to get everything straightened out. The company that is renting out the house I'm currently at is saying that since I'm moving out 'early' there won't be a new lease, and instead I'll be dropping from the current lease and declared 'vacating'.

That would be fine, since it's all the same to me, but they are asking me to sign a waiver saying the following:

> ""Vacating Tenant agrees to relinquish all rights to any sums which Landlord may be holding on behalf of Vacating Tenant including but not limited to a security deposit, advance rent, any prepaid
> fees or charges and agrees that nothing is owed to Vacating Tenant by the Landlord or its agent(s).""

I e-mailed the company and they say that the deposit cannot be withdrawn until everyone moves out.

My roommates are only living there for 6 more months and they are close friends, so I'm okay with dealing with this when they move out since it's only a few hundred dollars. I'm just worried about potential issues with the state of the house come that time and how much my deposit will be included in damages they do in the coming months.
Getting the new guy (that's replacing me) to just give me the share of the deposit also doesn't exactly work, since we do not know how much of the deposit would be used in the current state of the house. When I move out it will be 2 years at that house.

What should I do in this case?

TL;DR:","  Moving out, roommates staying, company says deposit cannot be withdrawn until everyone else moves out, worried about potential damages to house in the future.

TITLE: The new guy M(31) I'm F(23) seeing is pretty awful at texting and it confuses me.

POST: We met online and have been going on dates for the past month. Some of the dates have last entire weekends, or whole days. He has a unique personality and I adore his sense of humor. When we're together we laugh for most of the day. He's probably the most positive and uplifting person I've ever met.

But when we're not together, it's like radio silence. He'll text me maybe once late at night with a picture or something random. He usually takes a while to respond if we text earlier in the day. Totally understandable because he has a high pressure job, and I'm not into the whole text-all-day ordeal.

This morning he flew across the country to visit family, and I figured I'd hear from him when he landed (maybe just a confirmation text that he got there safely?) but I haven't heard from him all day. I don't want to bother him if he's with his family. He has called me quite a few times, and I enjoy talking on the phone with him. 

Last week after one of our dates we were lying in bed and he asked me if I had missed him (somewhat as a joke, because we saw each other the day before). I told him I did miss him, and he said that he missed me and was thinking about me all throughout the day. So I asked why he didn't text me or talk at all, and he said he was also busy with work. I don't think it's that he's not serious about me. Although we haven't had the exclusive talk, I've met his parents and his friends, and it seems like it's heading in a great direction. I'm already developing strong feelings for him.

I figured that would've prompted him to communicate a little bit more, but it hasn't. He's going to be away for 2 weeks, so I guess we'll see how the communication is, and if he doesn't make any effort, we'll talk when he returns. I'd like to be on the same page about it. What's the best way to approach this?

TITLE: TIFU at work

POST: TIFU: In the kitchen of the restaurant where I work (today was my 7th day), the county mandates that we have to wear gloves when handling food, no exceptions. So, when trying to fill cups of tartar and sour cream, I have some issues flipping and separating the cups. I thought I had a great idea: since the cups, much less the outside of the cups, are not food, let's not wear a glove; thought that cutting the tips off would be more fun. I neglected to remove my hand from the glove, and snipped the tips off my left index and middle fingers before I transformed my left ring fingerprint forever. That knife, as with all of our knives, are PARTICULARLY dull, so I had breezed that one through the (shitty) carbide pull sharpener a few times when I got in.

When going to get a napkin to staunch the flow and then ask for a bandage, I slipped on the freshly mopped area just outside the doors.

Not 20 minutes later, when returning the bucket of sour cream to the walk-in cooler, I again biffed on the freshly mopped floor of the cooler.

He went from being very good with money to being in debt and begging family for money. He then turns around and spends it on her.
Nobody can approach him about it. If they try he cuts them out of his life. They have an us against the world mentality.

TITLE: TIFU by unlocking the front door

POST: This past Saturday, my wife and I went out on a bike ride with two of my friends. She had just ordered some new clip in pedals and wanted to try them out. However she never practiced clipping in and out of the pedals and she ended up falling several times. Her last big fall, she ended up having a big scrape on her butt. She's been asking me to help her treat it since apparently my wife isn't that coordinated with cleaning a wound while looking at a full body mirror.

Fast forward to today. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law ask to come over to get some headache medicine. My s.i.l. wasn't feeling well, so I said sure. I wasn't aware that my wife was in the shower at the time. Out of habit, they both visit quite often and I usually unlock the door for them to come in. 

Wife comes out the shower and asks for my help once again to clean her wound on her butt. I'm still very hesitant to do it for her, but I give in. She comes in to the living room and lays on her stomach with neosporin and peroxide, ready for me to clean it. PRESUME THE CLEANING! Peroxide goes on and my wife does that ""SSSSSSS"" sound when something hurts, but you don't want to let out that sound. Still, it's loud enough for others to hear since she doesn't have a high tolerance for pain. Then I proceed to put the neosporin on her butt wound. As soon as I start, front door opens and brother and sister in law are coming in. First words they hear are ""Now doesn't that feel better?"" as I rub the neosporin,a bunch of thick white pain relief cream, on the wound. My wife jumps up out of embarrassment, and runs in the bedroom to isolation. My b.i.l and s.i.l just stare at me in all sorts of what the hell did I walk in on. To save the embarrassment and awkwardness of the situation, I just gave them the headache medicine and apologized profusely.

TITLE: Him (M43), me (F40), crossdressing, fetish, no reciprocity. Duration 16 years.

POST: Tonight I came home a bit early and found my husband in a tiny skirt. 

Apparently he bought it just last weekend as a lark when I was traveling for work. But now he says it might be that he wants to wear women's clothing every day at home. This is all a bit sudden for me.

He has always had a pantyhose fetish. He wants to include pantyhose in sex; otherwise he has trouble staying focused. I'll wear them, but what he really likes is him wearing them. I'm okay with this but not EVERY time we have sex. Unfortunately, he mostly seems to be interested when we include the hose.

He insists on me accepting him as he is and his fetish. Which is as it should be, but for him accepting it means he doesn't have to try sex any other way. He does not go down on me because he doesn't like it. We have no spontaneous sex because for him it's a big production with the hose and the dressing up and the setup. For two years I've asked him to indulge my super vanilla fantasy of having sex in the shower, but no - he says sex and water don't go together and that he's just uncomfortable. Basically, we do it his way (in bed in the evening, lights on, curtains drawn, with the hose) or not at all.

I've always been attracted to him though because he is a big masculine guy and that is my type. I like strong masculine men. But now he wants to be feminine. Every day. At home. I have no idea how I'm going to be sexually attracted to that version of him. And he says I am cruel and unaccepting if I can't.

I also cannot help but think that this is something that has been going on for a long while and he's been hiding it from me. It's hard to believe he got his first item of clothing just a few days before I caught him wearing it. And now I wonder what else he's hiding. 

Am I a horrible wife for having trouble with all this?

TITLE: [Discussion] How to help my sister who I'm pretty sure is depressed and in a very unhealthy and repetitive lifestyle

POST: Hey guys,

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I feel like posting here would bring a few helpful responses so here goes...

My sister is now 25 and has basically had the same routine since she started working full time 5 years ago. She works as a chef and because of that she gets odd days off which affect her very small and very limited social life. She mostly lounges around the house watching tv and not doing much of anything and she doesn't seem to want to change it.

Now I have to mention that me and her both share a handful of learning disabilities with a couple of differences, but the major ones affecting our lives would be a difficulty to communicate our thoughts and feelings accurately and the fact that we're both pretty slow thinkers. Processing information and then figuring out the proper course of action takes a while and can be easily disrupted due to horrible attention spans which makes many ordinary tasks very difficult and intimidating. Currently, her way of life is really taking a toll on the whole family (Me, my mother and father) because we all want her to not just become a slave to this unhealthy routine.

There's a lot more to this, but this is already a fairly long post so I'll try and sum things up quickly.

I'm pretty sure she's depressed, so I'm going to ask her if she wants to talk to a therapist or some sort of professional, but I don't want to intimidate her into becoming reclusive about the subject. So my question is, how can I bring this idea up to her and also what else can I do to try and help her out?

It really makes me sad to see her like this. So any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also any other subreddits that you know of that may be of help would be good to know too.

We have 3 teenaged boys ( 17, 16 and 14) who are very full of energy. They love to do anything that involves being physical (sports, and working out) and I would of thought that would of supressed some of their hormones, but they still have a horrible tendacy to fight. 

I am not talking about the typical playful ""boy fights"" that boys seem to do, but full on fist fights. Yesterday I got a call from my husband saying my two youngest were in the ER. Apparently older brother had broken their noses in a ""little fun fight"" they were having?? This has been going on for far too long honestly, and I know boys will be boys but I don't want my boys to keep hurting each other like this, even if they claim it isn't ""serious"". 

My husband says he hears them doing this but that they should learn to work out their problems, so he doesn't stop them. I'm not sure If its just me being a mom and overreacting? I can't seem to get through to him that he needs to STOP them when he hears them playing too rough. So we don't have more incidents like yesterday.

Im not even sure if this is normal behavior for teenage boys. They'll seriously be angry with one another and fighting one minute, then a few hours later will be back upstairs playing video games together. 

I have been considering maybe taking some time off work so I could be at home a little more.

So the bridge of the song comes on and usually it makes me drive faster so I'm thinking peace bitch as I press the pedal down in the Mustang GT (only an 06).

So now I'm going 140 - 160KM (I'm in Canada) and I see these two cars up ahead. I catch up to them very quickly and think I'll just slide right through these guys and be on my way. 

To my horror.. 

I see the back of a cop car. I know I'm fucked now. It was so obvious I was speeding.

Now I'm thinking, Jesus Christ, do I just slow down right beside the guy like the worlds biggest pussy and just start cruising with him? That's hella fucking embarrassing. I just said fuck it, I can't do that.

So I slow down a little and as I'm passing him I throw him a thumbs up (as if I might get lucky and get a cool cop lmao)

I pass by at 110KM and instantly the lights come on.

Fucking unreal. I ended up getting a ticket for speeding. At least he was pretty cool about it.

TL;DR:","  Was speeding on the highway, saw cop car behind me, threw him a thumbs up as if I might get lucky and get a cool cop lmao, got a ticket for speeding.",  I was speeding on the highway at night and caught up to a cop and didn't know whether to slow down or man up and try to get lucky.

POST: Me[21M] with my exgf [20F] - It was a clean breakup and we tried to be friends afterwards. We talked a lot and hung out occasionally. Recently just got a text from her saying that we should hold off on talking and hanging out for awhile. She has told me before that her current boyfriend (she started dating him less than a month after we broke up) is insecure and feels uneasy that we have been talking and stuff. I responded with something like ""If that's what you want"". Got another text later that night on the lines of ""It's not what I want"". I don't know what I should do. Should I just go with the flow and try to ride this out, or just forget about her and try to not be her friend (but she is cool and fun to hang around and really do consider her a friend).

TITLE: Girlfriend [22f] has lost all sex drive, but only after she started dating me [25m]

POST: Title says a lot of it.

She was dating a guy when I met her. We became good friends and were able to talk pretty openly.

She would tell me she ""needed"" to have sex roughly once-a-day, good for her and for the guy.

Winter break of last year comes around and she's unhappy in her relationship and cheats on the guy with me (I, to this day, feel terrible about this and have let the guy know how awful I feel about what I did). 

It wasn't just a fling we were very attached to each other and I knew I loved her very quickly into our relationship. I know she loves me as well.

We never had a very good sex life (I bombed the first few times) and it has never recovered. I've tried talking about it, spicing things up, being spontaneous, etc. Nothing works. She says she wants to have sex and that we need to do it more often, but it really doesn't happen. I believe she has sex with me just enough to keep me around and keep me from having the conversation again. (roughly once a month)

I want to fix this because I do love her, but she's already slowed down her sex drive. If we were to get married and have kids it would affect it that much more. 

Any advice?

OH, i forgot to mention, her reasoning behind the lack of sex is: ""You will pay attention to me even if we don't have sex, he would just roll over and go to sleep if I didn't have sex with him"". I'm being punished for being a better bf I guess.

Turns out the stupid thing has a cracked head in the engine block and is a complete write off. Worth nothing. My boyfriend said he knew that he should've had it looked at before he bought it but he was impatient and just wanted it. The guy he bought it from doesn't want a bar of it (the transaction is done). 

So, I'm annoyed about the whole thing. I didn't go off at him whatsoever, but expressed that I felt disrespected, because he considered the risk he was putting both of us in (we share incomes), but went ahead with it anyway. Now he's pissed at me because I'm not being understanding and want him to find a way to fix the issue. He says that I'm getting angry. I thought I was just telling him how I felt.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] of four months, she doesn't trust women around me.

POST: My girlfriend and I met at work, but got together after I switched jobs so that there wouldn't be any workplace drama. We have been together for 4 months this last Sunday. I have another female friend who I've known for 2+ years who I hang out with fairly frequently. She is straight, but we have no romantic interest in each other whatsoever, and we are both cool with that.

About a month and a half ago, my girlfriend approaches me very angry saying how she's upset that I sat next to my friend while watching a movie (even though I was actually sitting in the middle between the both of them). I try and find out why she's upset about this, and apparently she had been holding in her frustration for a while. Before she moved back into town for our college semester to begin, my female friend moved in a week early. Having not seen her for a large amount of the summer, we hung out a lot during the week before school. My girlfriend was not in town for this whole week, and when she arrived that weekend, I got a call that I needed to come home for family reasons. My girlfriend described her anger with this situation as ""You got to hang out with HER for a whole week, and when I got here, you leave me!""

After a while of fighting, I ask her why she's not upset when I spend time with my large amount of other friends (some of which are also female). She said that ""I don't hang around other girls. I don't trust them, all they do is make drama. Girls and guys can't be friends without any romantic interest. I'm tired of girls stealing my boyfriends from me, and I don't want to lose you."" She now gets upset about me texting my female friend, sitting next to her in any situation, or even bringing her name up in conversation. She's been going through a lot of family problems lately as well, so I don't want to break up with her and shovel even more problems onto her shoulders. What do I do?

TL;DR:","  My girlfriend doesn't trust women around me, especially ones that she has romantic interest in. She gets very angry when I hang out with other women.

TITLE: Care to share an event you experienced as a kid but never knew what really happened until recently?

POST: Events which really needed some insight in order to figure out what really happened (nothing too traumatic).
Here's mine:

* I wasn't a really great student back in grade 2 and the teachers really were scared of me. One day we had a math test; and math was just *not* something that I grasped at the time. For some reason I understood what was to be tested that day, I didn't really buckle down and study, I *just understood* out of nowhere how to do the questions. The teacher marked our tests really quickly and handed them back so we could go over the answers. She comes to me to share what I did for a fairly ""complicated"" question and then asked me how I got it right. **I couldn't tell her why**. I wasn't a great learner at the time and couldn't give her a logical reason, but clearly, I had work written out for that question. I said I forgot how I did it, and the teacher eyed me and said ""Hmm, that's weird I guess that happens sometimes, when students just *forget* how to find the answer"" and she moves on. So I think about it today, and it's very obvious she thought that I cheated; and at such a young age too! Sort of explains why I wasn't a very favored student among the staff.

So first some background:

I met her a couple of days ago through a mutual friend. We'll call her M. Me and M got to talking and we both seemed to feel kind of an instant spark between us. Besides the age difference we both have a lot in common, we both like video games, animals, watching movies, you name it. 

So the potential problem: 

We were talking tonight and during our conversation she told me she had been diagnosed with BPD ( Borderline Personality Disorder) which is a real mental health issue. So my question is, even though we get along great, and really like her, should I cut loose? Or should i give it a chance?

TITLE: I[f/24] am introducing my son[3yo] to my BF[23] of 1 month next week... Would like some advice please!

POST: Okay, a short back story for clarity:
I have never introduced a significant other to my son since his father and I split up a couple years ago. I've tried to make it a point to not parade men in front of him, and to be honest, I haven't felt serious enough about any of the men I've dated to even consider bringing them around.

So I haven't really spent a lot of time considering the possibility of what could happen when someone finally does meet him. 

My current boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a month. I had toyed with the idea of bringing up meeting my son to him, but decided it would be best to wait until he brought it up, because that would mean he's ready for it.

He did bring it up, and now we are planning an outing to the zoo together, just the three of us. 

Here's where I need some advice, or perhaps a similar situation that one of you may have gone through to comfort me a little. 

I'm definitely beginning to fall for this man. He is wonderful in every way so far. But what do I do if this ends up being too much for him to handle? I would like to be able to talk to him afterwards and ask him if he is still sure he's interested in pursuing this relationship after seeing a glimpse of what my child is like. Is this an appropriate thing to ask/talk about, and if so, how soon should I bring it up? 

I feel it's important to mention as a side note I bought him tickets to his favorite musical as a surprise (and they were not cheap!) and was planning on giving them to him as a ""Thank you"" after our date, but I am afraid that if he decides he isn't ready for something like this, he may feel obligated to stay with me after I had spent a small fortune on him... Should I still give them to him then, or wait?

TL;DR:",  I'm introducing my son to my BF of 1 month next week. Would like some advice on how to talk to him about the possibility of something more than just a casual relationship.,"  New boyfriend is meeting son, need to know when it's the right time to talk about things, and if its appropriate to give him a gift."

TITLE: Any way I could make a girl feel better by telling her she looks good?

POST: This girl I know well has often said she looked bad. Be it clothing, weight,her dress choice,etc. I have said she looks great after telling me she improved on her weight, she still was kinda nervous like adjusting her clothes and hair and trying to make it seem like she never mentioned anything, she did smile a bit and said thanks. Her dress according to her was bad so she changed it for a different one and I said you looked great and she told me how she exchanged her dress for another and why, going on and on. I told her dont worry you looked nice and she seemed okay. 

I feel like I could say something to her so it just makes her feel good or boosts her self esteem.Its not exactly low, just an effort could help. Do I just tell her she is beautiful or gorgeous? Or should I do it some other way like compliment her clothes? I know body parts are a definite no.

TITLE: The rest of my family is pretty overweight...I'm not sure how to tell them I want to lose weight.

POST: This has been a problem for me ever since I started wanting to lose weight - I started taking birth control and gained weight back to my highest, which really is only 30 pounds over my GW and technically not even overweight. 

My mother, father, and sister are all overweight - my sister unfortunately did not get my genes, and has been this way all our lives despite eating basically exactly the same as I did. My mother has been overweight my entire life. My father as well, though even more-so now that he's getting well into his 50s. 

Whenever I want to tell my family that I want to lose weight, I feel guilty, almost ashamed. All I can think is that I'm insulting them. I'm 'the pretty one' according to my sister, my mother has tried to diet and has failed, and going to them, saying I want to lose 30 pounds when I'm technically not even overweight (I'm relatively close - 5 or 10 more pounds would do it) feels like a slap in the face. I love my family. I don't want them to feel like I'm judging them. My sister is gorgeous. My parents are wonderful, beautiful people. I would like to have their support, but I don't think I can ask for it. My father, especially, wouldn't give up junk food if I asked them to do it with me...and asking them to do it with me feels like an even bigger slap in the face. Like my own weight loss goals are just a ploy to get them to eat healthier. 

The problem is when I'm home, which will be really often soon, there's all kinds of junk in the house, and my mother hates to cook so will often want to opt for take out or order in stuff that's really high calorie. I'm worried it'll only make my weight loss harder. 

My mother is really sensitive, and so is my sister. I'm kind of lost here.

TL;DR:",  My family is pretty overweight. I want to tell them I want to lose weight but feel guilty whenever I try. How do I go about telling them I want to lose weight without insulting them?,"  My family is wonderful, but not necessarily fit.

TITLE: Me[19 M] with my[23 F] friend who has a LDR, wants to keep hanging out.

POST: I first met this girl through an mmo mobile game, called ingress, where you have to meet others in order to play the game, near March of this year.

When I first saw her, I couldn't believe she was actually playing the game to begin with. In my mind I kept going, ""what are you doing here, you are defenitely out of place"".

I just shrugged it off and didn't think much of it, because I never thought that I would ever really create a relationship with her to begin with. A few months pass and I decide to chat her up. 

Suprisingly, she responds and we end up messaging each other past till one o'clock some nights. Eventually we hang out and we head to an ingress related event in another major city close by. 

But, before we leave she hits me with the boyfriend card. So the entire day of the event, I was devastated. 

After the event, I´m still talking to her and hang out with her a few more times. It was all fine until, one day her bf, when we were hanging out, flipped out on her and they had a huge arguement about him being jealous. 

After that I´ve tried my best to cut down on communicating with her, which is tough because she still plays ingress as much as I do, and avoid hanging out together so her bf won´t get jealous again. 

But now, she wants to hang out again, and I´m starting to think that she only wants to hang out to fill that void, that her bf can´t fill since he is somwhere else or she is just trying to make him jealous again. 

So I just wanted to ask if I should hang out with her again or bail on any plans that she wants to make.

TL;DR:","  Girl I´ve been talking to for a while has a LDR and wants to hang out again, but I think she is just trying to make her bf jealous again.

We finally talked on the phone for about ten minutes 4 days later on Monday (after calling and texting Sunday night and never getting a response), and once before that for a couple of minutes when she was drunk and wanted to bitch about her friend.

I think ""Uhh what? it is Saturday at 6:30."" However, the bar was pretty empty and it looked like majority of the patrons were tabbing out. I, thinking this is probably a joke, continue to walk in with my girlfriend. The burly bartender again yells, ""We're closed!"" but a little louder this time.

Later, she told me she wished I would have sucked it up and gone in and gotten a beer with her but wasn't overly upset with me for how I acted.

TITLE: [x-post from r/AskReddit] Every day I see a kid getting bullied, and I don't know what to do.

POST: I get the bus to work most days, and each time I'm on it, there's this group of rowdy schoolboys sitting in the back seats, shouting and swearing and generally being teenage boys.

They get off at the stop that this sweet little boy (let's call him Fred) gets on at, even though they all go to the same school. Fred is tiny, only about 4'6"", whereas these others boys are well over five feet tall. When they get off, they push him and shove him around, laugh at him and shout his name and cat-call and whistle at him. Every day, he gets on the bus close to, or in, tears.

I realise this isn't the full extent of the bullying, it's only the tiny portion I see, and nothing makes me angrier than a group of bullies ganging up on some defenseless kid.

I really, utterly detest the thought of just being another onlooker, watching the mob and doing fuck all to help the victim, but I have absolutely no idea what to do. I know Fred's first name and his and the bullys' school, so realistically I could call them up and do something about it, but I feel like that would be interfering and I'm worried it might make matters worse for Fred. I've considered talking to him on the bus, but again I don't want to interfere and I don't think Fred would appreciate knowing just how visible his pain is to people.

TITLE: Is 4.8% APR high when the contract rate is 4% on the mortgage?

POST: quick background:

Buying a house, going conventional with 3% down to avoid lifetime PMI on an FHA loan. Pretty far into the process and the broker runs some numbers (he said they were on the high end) where the contract rate was 4%, the APR comes out to 4.8% and that seems like a pretty big jump from contract rate to APR, almost a whole percent.

Talked to the broker on the phone and said it seemed like a pretty big jump and he thought i was looking for hidden fees or something, I really wasn't. Although he suggested that it may be higher because I was only putting 3% down.

TL;DR:",  Is 4.8% APR high when the contract rate is 4% on the mortgage? Talked to the broker and he suggested it may be higher because I was only putting 3% down.,  Is there a general rule of thumb of how much higher the APR should be over the contract rate?

POST: r/college, I'm a natural introvert.  I don't really have much in common with my generation.  I don't like rap, I can't dance for shit, and I don't really like the taste of alcohol.  Add some social anxiety to that and you've got my current situation.

I'm a month into college, and for four Fridays and Saturdays, I've sat in my dorm room doing absolutely nothing.  Browsing Reddit, playing Xbox by myself, usually offline (the wifi is spotty on the 12th floor), things like that.  I look all around me and see people connecting.  I have made two or three friends while I've been here, but the awkwardness and hesitation plays into me not really actively trying to hang out with them.  I'm usually okay on my own, but lately I've been feeling kinda lonely.  I really don't know how to push myself to go do things or meet people I don't expect to have anything in common with.  

Is there anything I can do?  I WANT to meet people.  I WANT to find someone who I really do connect with.  College is usually the place to do that, but it seems I'm not doing well with it.  Part of the reason I feel so isolated is because my major is Language Studies and I want to get into the JET program to teach English in Japan, which inevitably means I'd be leaving the States after college.  It feels like anything I would try to create now, relationship or friendship, would automatically have a time limit on it.  I'm not the partying kind of person.  I'm not a drinker.  I don't smoke cigarettes.  Haven't met anyone who smokes weed but I really don't want to get caught high/in possession, especially my freshman year.

TITLE: Me [23 M] broke up with my girlfriend [21 F] of 1 year. Her immediate rebound and history of depression is worrying me.

POST: I broke up with my girlfriend a few weeks ago. It wasn't sudden, it was something that we had talked about over the last month. She was absolutely devastated though, and completely heart broken. As much as I still care about her and remember all the great times we had, it was something that I needed to do.

When we broke up she said that she loved me more than anyone before, and wouldn't be able to easily get over it.

Knowing that she has struggled with a lifelong battle of depression, I wanted to make sure that she was doing okay by checking in with her friends. To my surprise I find out that she has started dating a heavy drinking and druggy kid she knows and removed all of our pictures together on social media outlets just days after the breakup. I can say with confidence that there was no prior kindling of a relationship between them beforehand.

I don't feel good about this. Especially with her history. I got to know her very well, and I loved her for a long time, but this, its not right. I am very worried about her.

TITLE: Ladies, should I confront him about his baby that's on the way?

POST: I have a coworker [M, 25] that likes me [F, 25], and he's been trying to go out with me for months now, ever since he broke up with his ex GF. He first asked me out at the end of last year, but I told him I don't think it's a good idea to date coworkers (especially since we work in a very small office, and I didn't wanna be his rebound anyways). 

He's still unrelenting - always complimenting me, flirting with me, suggesting date ideas, etc. Honestly, I like him too, and I was just about to finally give in when... 

Another coworker in our office told me that this guy is expecting a baby with his ex-GF. She's about 6 months pregnant now, which means that he's probably known about it, and HID it from me, the entire time he's been coming after me. Everyone in the office seems to know except me, which is weird because he usually tells me all his secrets and doesn't tell anyone else. The other day, in front of a new coworker, he flat out DENIED ever getting a girl pregnant when the subject happened to come up, and I desperately wanted to call him out on his lie. 

Do you ladies think I should confront him about it? I feel used/deceived. Why would he know he's got a baby on the way, yet hide it from me and still try to ask me out? Even if I didn't like him like that, why would he keep it from me as his friend? It's hurtful that he would feel the need to exclude this life-changing event from me. 

Advice? Thoughts?

TITLE: Girlfriend [18F] is too attached for me to leave her. Please help.

POST: So the other day my girlfriend for 6 months and I [18M] had a bit of an argument which lead to us talking about us breaking up. She told me that if I ever left her, she would still love me and wait for me to love her again even if I was dating someone else. She said she would never date anyone else again after me and even if she did, she would still have feelings for me and try to find some parts of me in that other guy.

While this was an incredibly sweet thing to say, it comes at the wrong time for I feel myself losing feelings for her. I fear that we don't have enough in common (in fact we're opposites and in this case opposites don't attract). 

I don't want to treat her poorly and get her to leave me and stop loving me because I can't do that to her, but I feel like we should just be friends. How can I do this without treating her terribly while also getting her to lose feelings for me after time too? I don't want her to be the kind of obsessive ex. 

I've been trying to give her subtle hints that I'm not happy with her (no sexual contact, trying to keep the conversations short, spending less time with her).

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 2 months, mild ex problems.

POST: Last night my ex (who of which broke up with me a year ago and in somewhat neutral terms) has been texting me quite a bit more since my current relationship began. My ex invited me to a party but I declined. She then mentioned how she missed being able to call me at 5am to talk about any problems and such. Most of this she texted to me at 5am. 

I don't really know what to say to my ex. She mentioned that she doesn't want  to intrude, and I understand that. But I don't think it's necessary to cut ALL contact from her, it would hurt her if I refused to speak with her at all. 

I showed my girlfriend the text messages she sent. I was not going to hide this, she has every right to know. My GF was really hurt and pissed off at her, explaining how disrespectful it is because my ex was being very personal to me especially that she messaged me so late. 

So now I'm in the kitchen alone 4 hours after I showed her the messages. I asked my GF if she was feeling better, she isn't. I'm giving her a little space at the moment while she sleeps so hopefully it helps. She's being very distant both physically and emotionally. It's hurting me too. Advice?

TITLE: How do I [M/22] convince my GF [F/20] that we can manage long distance?

POST: My gf and I have been dating for a little more than a year after meeting at university. About about halfway through, I graduated and left university. Since then, we've been doing long-distance, but it's only about a 2 hour drive (I understand this is not a vast distance). Since then, I've tried my best to visit, sometimes she does (once every 3 weeks at most, typically every two weeks with back-to-back weekends not uncommon). She can be a bit needy and clingy. I try to cater to those needs, within reason. I send care packages, talk to her often, and do my best to spoil her when we do see each other. I do my best to keep our romance.

However, when we are apart she finds herself sad and second guessing the relationship. She's apprehensive about our future because it is highly likely that we won't ever be in the same city for the foreseeable future. In spite of this, I'm fully committed to her. She is a good person, the type of woman I want to be with and have a future with. Unfortunately, she's apprehensive because she sees sadness as a component of being long-distance. For me, I'd rather try my hardest and potentially fail doing long distance. For her, she'd rather get out now than to hurt more later. However, she says she sincerely wants to be with me, but is unsure and unconfident in my abilities to fulfill her needs in a relationship.

What can I do? How can I show her that we can do long distance and still have a healthy relationship?

Or do I have to accept that this just won't work out? That the best thing I can do for her and me is to just let things go? I just have a hard time accepting ""long-distance"" as a reason to break-up, when I know full well how happy we are when we are together.

TL;DR:",  GF is apprehensive about long distance and is unsure of my ability to fulfill her needs. How can I convince her that we can manage long distance and still have a healthy relationship?,  GF thinks being long-distance involves being sad for a majority of the time.

TITLE: I have a question about work related injuries...

POST: The statue of limitations may be up, but I got injured on the job a year and some months ago. I slipped and fell at work and landed straight on my butt. I was okay after it happened, but later on the nerve pain hit. I finished my shift and went home. The next day it was awful and I went to talk to the manager about going to the hospital. She was totally rude and so was another manager. That's a whole different story. I was only able to go to one place (manager told me this), so I went. I got x-rays done, they thought I broke my spine. I didn't, just some serious nerve inflammation. It did show that I was starting to form DJD. Ever since that accident, I've had chronic back pain and chronic sciatica. I'm pretty sure this helped speed up my back issues. I am now disabled to the point I have to walk with a cane and at times a walker. I'm 23 years old with degrees in Healthcare and can't get a job in TN at all. (It's an at will state. I walk in with a cane and they'll say ""You don't have enough experience, sorry."" My degree has some HR background, I know how it will go.) I'm just wondering if there is anything I could do. I went through hell with that company (big chain). I was discriminated against, talked down to by management  (GM for that matter) and I feel like this has ruined my life.

TITLE: I [20/m] am in love with a girl[19/f] with a sex problem (commitment issues?)

POST: Background on her and our relationship: she didn't have a glamorous childhood. parents were divorced early, went through multiple marriages and significant others each, abandonment from her father who recently has come back into her life, and worst of all she was sexually assulted/raped as a teen by a neighborhood friend which cost her her virginity. We have been together for about a year and a half now. I'm not her first long term boyfriend, but she often says that no one has ever shown her love like I have. 

We have recently been through some turbulence, as we've recognized issues within our relationship we find unhealthy and are working to either correct them or move on. After weeks of feeling like we were finding our way on the right path, yesterday she broke down to me and admitted that she thinks she may have a sex problem after confessing to sleeping with another man (who she also slept with while we were dating) In her own words, ""I know I love you, I know you are the perfect person for me, and I know it's must be hard to understand, but when someone gives me their undivided attention and shows me that they love me, even if I know they don't, it's hard to say no when they come onto me sexually.""

Regardless if we date again or not, above everything else, she is my best friend, so when she came to me with this problem I wanted to do anything in my power to be there for her and support her through this. I know admitting that to me wasn't easy. so my questions for you, reddit, are:

1) how should I approach the situation to most benefit her

2) Has anyone been in my shoes before, and if so, do you have any advice?

3) Has anyone been through what she is going through, problems with sex or commitment, and if so what got you through it? Is there something you wish you or someone such as a close friend would have done to help you?

POST: sorry for the really bad title, it was pretty hard to try to explain this situation in a sentence.

basically been dating this girl for 3 years in high school, overall it was a good relationship; we had fights every now and then and ive had my doubts but overall it was good. then college came and she moved across the country. we tried long distance but decided to break up. 

first quarter of my college passed. Im a commuter to a small college while she dorms in a college in a large city. i basically made 0 friends while she found plenty of male attention. long story short, one night stands aside, she has a boyfriend of sorts (not official but basically) now.

where I come in is that when we saw each other again during winter break, she told me about her life and it really hurt my heart (even though we were technically no longer together). week or two later were acting like were dating, she and i basically fell in love all over again. now she is going back to new york to her other boy, and saying since the relationship, even if we make it an open one, wouldnt work we should be just friends.

i have no idea what to do, should I hold onto her as just a friend that I talk to on facebook or skype, should I hold on to the hope that she will just come back to me, should I just forget all about her and try to move on with my life? our connection is still very real and she said she would treat me the same way whether were friends or in an open relationship or not. im emotionally crazy right now, im on top of the world when shes around and lamenting the thought of her not being here with me and potentially never being so when im not with her. all of this stacks onto my anxiety, self-esteem issues, and my crippling fear that i will never find a girl as great as she was /is.

I've devoured most top links and started reading ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" and I'm loving it so far (A Random Walk, Intelligent Investor, and Millionare Next Door are on the list). It comes at great time since I've been meaning to get my first credit card and savings account. 

Now, the thing is that while the advice is sound and I can follow the general outline of it, things in Mexico are different. For one, I can't seem to find anything similar to a Roth IRA in that it's tax free. Also, creditdit lines, APYs and pretty much everything is inferior.

It was in a regionally accrediated state school out of state (so it was still 100% legit, and all my exams were proctored). I got better after the first year, but I had to finish online because many schools around me require the last 60 units to be done from them, so that would have required an extra year in school for no reason.

Anyways, they always ask me ""How was it there? How was the weather?"" There was one interviewer that seemed turned off by the idea saying I was sick for a year and that's why I had to do that, I even mentioned I'm no longer sick. I couldn't tell if it was because I said online or because of my illness.

So is it smart to only bring up that I just couldn't afford the university I was going to before? Which is true. Do I not bring up the fact I was sick? Do I mention that all my courses were 100% the same as on campus students?

POST: I'm using a throwaway because my girl will go on reddit sometimes.  Title pretty much says it all.

We've been together for about a year and a half.  The first year was great, we lived close to each other and spent most of our time together.  Then she had to move with her parents ten hours away from everything she's ever known.  So we've spent the last six months long distance.  She started school and everything was going well for the most part.  We've had our issues here and there but we've mostly worked through them.  Things have still been pretty good despite our random arguments.  I would say we're both a little over protective of one another, probably even more so now that we're about 500 miles apart.  And here's where I need advice.  She recently started talking with one of the guys in her class and they want to get together and work on a take-home test with each other.  Because of my past, I've had some trust issues and this situation seems all too familiar with me.  Previous ex went and ""studied"" which really was just her studying the guys dick.  So because of this, I'm feeling uncomfortable with my girlfriend going and studying with this new guy she met.

I understand deep down that my fears are irrational and its not fair to her to compare her to my ex.  I want to be okay and be care-free about who my girlfriend hangs out with and stuff but I'm just uncomfortable with it all.  It's really consumed my thoughts for the past few days since she told me about what she was going to do.  I feel that if she was going to study with a girl, I'd be perfectly fine with it, but since its a guy, I  feel uncomfortable.  I would never tell her to not go and study with him because I don't want to be that guy and that would probably only push her away.  So how do I overcome these thoughts about what could happen?  How do you be comfortable with this?  I feel that these are probably my insecurities talking, so what do you do to become more secure?

An introvert being someone who is content being alone and pursuing solitary hobbies, as opposed to an extrovert who is most comfortable in the presence of other people.

I was thinking about the idea of introversion and there's something I don't quite understand.  A lot of the self-proclaimed introverts seeking relationship advice are clearly unhappy with themselves, or at least, unhappy with their current situation, and see their ""introversion"" as a curse.  But by definition, wouldn't a true introvert be someone who is genuinely content with their relatively solitary lifestyle?

Is it possible that a great number of struggling ""nice guys"" are not truly introverts, but rather, people who strongly desire the company of others, but merely lack the social skills to obtain it?  Does it make sense to describe someone as being a frustrated extrovert unable to satisfy their social desires?

I don't know much about psychology, so it's entirely possible that I don't properly understand what it means to be introverted or extroverted.  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the subject.

TL;DR:","  Is it possible that a great number of struggling ""nice guys"" are not truly introverts, but rather, people who strongly desire the company of others, but lack the social skills to obtain it?","  By definition, isn't an introvert someone who is CONTENT with a solitary lifestyle?

TITLE: My (22F) boyfriend's (23M) disability might be causing friction...

POST: Hey /r/relationships,

For some background, my boyfriend has oculucutaneous albinism. Essentially he has pale and sometimes translucent skin, very light blonde hair, and his eyes move back and forth due to a related condition called nystagmus. 

My boyfriend thinks that he has faced a good deal of discrimination due to his disability. He goes as far as to say that people don't want to really get to know him because of how he looks. He has very few friends, but the ones he does have are very close friends. I'm not sure if he's right or not, but I do know I enjoy spending time with him and really can't see why his personality would turn people off. 

Now for the friction. He and I have decided we are going to be entirely honest with each other. This means telling each other things that aren't always pleasant. 

The fact of the matter is I have a good friend who has told me flat-out to dump my boyfriend because he looks weird. (She even pointed out the moving eyes and hair) I have a few others who have disapproved of me dating him because they don't find him attractive enough. Of the several friends who have met him or seen his picture, only one hasn't implied or outright told me that my boyfriend is unattractive because of his condition. 

I have told him about all of these interactions because we both promised total honesty. Also, I think I may have made a mistake recently. A guy in one of my classes was hitting on me (even though I told him I have a boyfriend).  My BF asked me who I found more attractive and I told him that I find him more emotionally attractive but I find the other guy more physically attractive. 

Now my boyfriend is acting very distant and I'm not really sure why or what to do. Please advise reddit.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend has albinism and people have told me to dump him because he looks weird. He's acting distant and I'm not sure why or what to do. Please advise.,  BF has albinism. My friends want me to dump him for it. I told him about it and now he's distant.

POST: So i made the mistake of having a small fling with my professor. I know this was extremely dumb of me and I regret it. I was insecure at the time, feeling lonely, it was exciting.. I made a mistake and gave in to what was wrong. Nontheless, as soon as I got my head on straight I ended it. It was never 'healthy' and I was just confused. He was in a bad place in his marriage and enjoyed talking to me and misinterpreted friendship for something more and went after it. I, being young and just not in a very good place, was curious and gave in. We hooked up for a few months and I really hated the person I was becoming. I ended it and he did not take it so well. Its been 5 months since I told him I was not interested in anything but a professional relationship with him. And he still has not accepted no for an answer. He emails me and begs me to reconsider and give him a real shot one day. That he will wait for me. I'm not sure how to make myself more clear. He says he needs to talk to me and get closure. That he has things he needs to say to me that he's kept bottled up for the last few months and needs to get off his chest. I told him that he wouldn't find the closure he needs by talking to me. That he really should talk to a therapist or a professional because I am not qualified to deal with this. He has this delusional idea that he's in love with me and claims we are soul mates. The last thing I want to do is add fuel to the fire.

TITLE: New girlfriend going out on a ladies night, is this normal?

POST: The short story here is that I don't have a ton of dating experience. I was in a relationship out of high school where I ended up getting married, fast forward eight years (25 now) and I am dating someone new (same age as me). I guess it should be fair to mention that my ex did cheat on me (not physically but had an emotional affair) and I'm no longer with her.

I've been dating this new girl for a few months, she's incredible, we spend a lot of time together, and I've got an amazing connection with her. Truthfully I know in my heart that she'd never cheat on me like the last, she's genuinely a great girl who's never given me any reason to not trust her, but I think I am now carrying forward this small bit of trust issues from my previous relationship. I never used to be a jealous person or have trust issues and I'm getting smalls bits of it with this new girl which I know isn't fair but the feelings are hard to fight. 

So she's going out on a ladies night, and I find out that she's going to be drinking with her bud at this event and dancing. Am I crazy for not liking the fact that she's dancing with other men? She's made it clear that it's country dancing, line dancing, etc, nothing like how I'd normally dance (grinding and whatnot) and that it wouldn't be with just one guy and has said all the things I want to hear like she'd make it clear she has a bf if they bring it up etc, but I just personally feel like dancing is an intimate thing and am having a hard time coming to grips with being cool with her out dancing with other guys.

TL;DR:","  New girlfriend going out on a ladies night and dancing with other guys, I feel uncomfortable with it and am having a hard time coming to terms with it. Am I crazy for being jealous?","  Girlfriends going out on a ladies night, dancing with other guys and I'm not really cool with it.

TITLE: I [23F] have been stressed about feeling like a ""sugar momma"" to my boyfriend [23 M] for months now

POST: I know money shouldn't be a problem aspect in a relationship but it has been really bothering me. We have been together for almost 6 years.

My SO has been struggling to find a stable job and bought a car too soon and any money that he does make goes to the car. He bought the car 6 months ago thinking he'd get a job which he didn't. He's struggled with having a good job for the entirety of our relationship. I can understand when we were young, but he finished post-secondary before me and has had double the time to look for a job than I have. This makes me think he's lazy.

He doesn't mooch and he never asks for money unless he is desperate - he has never asked *me* for money. I've been paying for all of our meals out and even his fast food/snacks when we're together for a few months now. I would feel guilty if I didn't because I don't want him to go into debt or feel he can't enjoy himself with me and our friends.

I know I shouldn't be that typical girl that thinks ""oh the guy is the one who should be the supporter"" - I'm all about equity in a relationship and splitting things financially. It's hard to not want my guy to take care of me though. I'm all about being a strong and independent woman but when I see or hear about other relationships where the girls are always being taken care of financially it's hard for me to not want some part of that. It really bothers me to think that I'm like his ""sugar momma"" right now. 

I want to move out of my parents house and buy my own but I can't and don't want to do it alone. Right now I feel like I am. This stresses the hell out of me. How can I deal with this? I personally gotten him two jobs (through my own connections), both which haven't turned out - what more can I do?? How can I not let money bother me in our relationship?

TITLE: I [17/m] feel guilty about my feelings towards my recently single friend [17/f]

POST: Crossposting from another sub because this seems more suitable.

**Sorry in advanced for any typos or unclear sentences, I'm drunk and typing this on my phone.**

Ok so flashback to the day before yesterday. One of my close friends [17/f] broke up with her boyfriend (another friend of mine) because he treated her like shit etc. She called me [17/m] up before she did it because she wanted me to be at her house for emotional support. We hung out for a short while but I had to get home before it was too late because I had work really early in the morning. The next day (yesterday) I got off at 12 (short shift) and went over to her house because she wanted to hang out again. We started watching a bunch of movies (we have a giant list that we want to watch because one of us hasn't seen it), but halfway into the second movie we were a bit buzzed from wine (not enough to cloud judgement) and we started playing this weird game (or whatever the fuck it would be) where we try to not have the other person blow in your ear and the one who was trying to blow into the other's ear was ""losing"". Idk, shit was weird. Anyways, this led us to a lot of contact and getting very close to each other. There were points where I was so close I could feel our lips slightly touching and I wanted to kiss her so, so bad (and I think she might have wanted to as well) but I didn't. Once we both started to lose energy we just lied down on the couch and started kind of spooning while she was grasping my hand. This part was post buzz (about 4 hours after alcohol kicked in).

I loved that day. We had so much fun. I want to start a relationship with her. I felt the same way about her 9 months ago but I thought I was over her. But I know it's wrong. It's wrong because she just got out of a relationship and it's wrong because her ex is one of my friends. What do I do?

TITLE: Feeling agitated about the lack of communication skills exhibited by the contact person at the service that provides our officiant (All Seasons Weddings). [my first Weddit rant]

POST: Edit: what a convoluted title. 

I am so frustrated. We received an email from our wedding coordinator informing us that it was time to choose an officiant from the service (All Seasons) that is on contract with our venue. We went to their website and selected an officiant that really jumped out at both of us and submitted their web form, formally requesting him. A week later we received an email from them saying, ""[Venue] has contacted us to say you are getting married there. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, it's time to pick an officiant and confirm all of these details regarding the location, date, time, and overall vibe of your ceremony."" I replied back saying I had already been in contact to request an officiant and I answered ALL of her questions, and said that we were still in the process of confirming our ceremony time and that I would let her know ASAP. The next day I emailed again to confirm ceremony time, and within ten minutes I received a reply from her saying, ""Thanks for confirming your ceremony time, can you answer everything else now?"" Uhm, I already did. So I replied back answering all of her questions again and reiterating our interest in this one specific officiant. Three days go by and I receive ANOTHER email from her saying, ""Great, now all that is left to do is confirm your ceremony time and we can check if the officiant you want is available."" Arg! I just don't understand why they can't pay attention to the things that I've emailed them. Should I send back one email reconfirming all information start to finish? I think if I get another email asking me any of the same questions again I'm going to go nuclear. How hard is it? We are paying you $380 to officiate our wedding, I'd think the least you could do would be pay attention to us when we contact you.

TITLE: I'm [19 M] having trouble forgetting my [19 F] ex of 2 years at same small college.

POST: I've been dating this girl since my junior year of high school and we always had each other in mind when going off to college.

Now we go to the same school and I broke things off with her after 2 years because I started to realize she didn't care about my personal interests and I did not get to enjoy a lot of things with her.

However, she has been my best friend for 5 years now and I just can't forget about her. I went to a party at another school and met someone else but I had to stop talking to her because my ex is still on my mind. She has also been telling me about the great times she has been having since we broke up and she's ""living life."" Maybe it's jealousy, but these thoughts never escaped my mind.

I've been very frustrated with her trying to tell me how great her life is. I tried talking to her last week about this, but she saw a physical mark on my neck from said party and she refused to talk to me for a week until I begged her to let me explain.

Now that she listened to me, I don't know what to do with myself. She sort of hates me but I'm still craving the relationship we used to have or even just to have her friendship back.

I know most people on here and other people I've talked to say let her go, never speak to her again, but I see her everyday and my emotions get the best of me.

So my question here is what should I do about where I stand with her and what should I do to move on?

TITLE: I [30/M] always have a bit of trouble sealing the deal: transitioning from flirty talk and clear signals of interest to actually doing something about it

POST: Let's limit my question to parties where there are a bunch of folks who at least all share the host(ess) in common (as opposed to bars). I have no problem connecting with strangers in this type of situation and love to engage people and talk.

Occasionally, I'll click really well with someone. We'll have had a great conversation, a lot of flirting, and there's clearly some interest. But when it comes time to actually ask the person out/suggest they come home with me, I freeze up and end in a, ""Welp! Great talking to you!""

I find this applies both to potential casual hookups and potential dates. Though there is more pressure if it's a potential hookup.

I feel like there is never a good time to ask either question. I feel like everyone around us is watching me and listening in, waiting to hear me ask this person this question and either ready to laugh or shake their heads in solemn shame.

This happened twice this weekend. Saturday party, met a fantastic woman, but could not bring myself to ask her out (though, she is the sister of a friend, so that added a bit of pressure to it). Then, Sunday BBQ at my own apartment, cute girl shows up, is clearly into the idea of maybe sticking around until morning (the hints were not very subtle, and I was totally into the idea), but I just can't make it happen because she's my roommate's girlfriend's friend, and I feel like they'll get all judgy. Even though they'd probably encourage it in the end.

I met my last girlfriend at a party in this sort of situation, but could not bring myself to ask her out in front of people, and instead found her and messaged her on Facebook (which she was surprisingly ok with). I'd like to not have to do that again and just ask someone out like a normal person.

Again, I generally have no social anxieties and can hold myself in a crowd of strangers. But this triggers some sort of fear in me.

TL;DR:","  I freeze up when it comes time to ask someone out, especially when it's a potential hookup. I feel like everyone around me is watching and listening in. How can I transition from flirty talk to clear signals?","  How can I get over this perception that I'm being watched and judged every time I try to ask a girl out/over? This strikes more fear in me than actually being rejected by the person, honestly."

It's not as if I don't want her to have a good time in England or anything, it's just that I really don't want to not see her for more than a week. And I just don't really know how to deal with this emotion.

Additionally, I'm pretty concerned about the potential consequences not seeing each other enough in the first weeks could have for the rest of the relationship.

And, just in case you were wondering, I really love her and I'm not planning on leaving her anytime soon :)

TITLE: My [22F] mother [50sF] uses the wrong name when she's upset with me

POST: I realized tonight that I can't seem to figure out this situation.

I'm transgender (female pronouns), and have been using a new first name since about October. She's very supportive and uses my new name all the time. Sometimes she slips up and uses my old name, but corrects herself right afterwards.

The problem is when she's upset with me. Every time, without fail, she uses my old name without correcting herself. It feels like shit and makes things worse because it doesn't exactly put me in a mindset to try to resolve things.

I'm recovering from a long period of depression and inactivity and there is A LOT going on in my life right now. I'm trying to stay afloat at a new (wonderful) job, which is difficult after such a long time of inactivity. Coming home, I just want to hide in my room and shut down for a bit. Instead I'm expected to help with anything she wants me to do at a moments notice, and when I say no she gets upset and calls me by my old name. 

I told my boyfriend about it and he thinks she does it to hurt me. I found myself coming up with all sorts of excuses for her behavior. She only does it when she's stressed or unfocused. Then again, today she used it three times in a row. When I corrected her, she said ""Sorry."" in what felt like a rather unapologetic tone. 

I need some outside perspective here. I'm looking for rooms to rent to live somewhere else, but I don't know when I'll be able to find anything. Am I being unreasonable when I need time alone, and refuse to drop everything whenever she needs something done? Does habit and stress excuse her from calling me something that's hurtful to me? I really don't know.

TITLE: Wife not interested in sex two years after her emotional affair

POST: I [M40] have a very beautiful and sexy wife [33] and have been married 8 years. We have two young children of 1 and 5. About two years ago i found out that my wife was having an 'emotional affair' with someone who she worked with. This lasted about six months and he even left his wife, at least partially for her. She denies that anything physical happened, but they went on coffee dates etc.. and there were clearly inappropriate moments and probably text messages. She refuses to go into detail saying she doesnt want to hurt me. 

I cant change what happened and actually dont think I really want to know the extent. She said she is sorry for what happened but doesnt take full responsibility and partially blames what happened on my long work hours and work stress which she says affected our relationship. We had a very rough patch but she eventually ended contact and they no longer work together. We had our second child after that, but things have never been the same. 

We hardly ever have sex (about once every 4 to 5 months) because she says that she doesnt have any libido and has also suffers with very bad dyspareunia. She is pretty affectionate but she resists any physical advances from my side and says that she needs more time. She has been seeing a gynecologict for over a year but things are not better. 

I am at my wits end. We used to have great sex, about twice a week at least. I cant help but think that there is more going on. We have tried therapy but things are not better. I have considered hiring a PI to follow her and find out if something else is up. I have directly asked her if there is somebody else or if she has contact with the 'other man' who is now divorced. She denies anything and this has led to huge fights. I am desperate to have my wife back!

POST: In honor of steak and BJ day, of course...

We've been dating for 6 months or so. Other than the occasional small argument we may have (nothing major), things have been good. She's probably one of the smartest girls I have ever dated. Our personalities are pretty similar and we get along well.

I would say she is somewhat ""sheltered"" when it comes to sex, it seems. She isn't into wearing lingerie or anything, and when we first started dating she told me she had never seen porn. For Christmas I had playfully suggested my present should be her in sexy-times clothes. Yeah, don't think so.

On top of this, it became incredibly obvious after a few months of dating that a BJ was never going to happen. I mean, not only has she never made a move, but after bringing it up I was immediately told it made her feel ""uncomfortable"".

So, here I am, on steak and BJ day... and I really want a BJ. This is actually the first girl I've ever dated that has not gone down on me, and ironically, it's the one whos company I enjoy the most. I should also point out I have no problem with going down on a girl, and I have even done it to her once, but I obviously am not going to continue go down on a girl that doesn't return the favor.

I guess I have 2 questions:

1. Am I being ridiculous for ultimately thinking this isn't going to work in our current state;
2. Has anyone ever even worked themselves out of a situation like this? I mean, even if she did give me a BJ, I can't imagine it is going to go well, or that it would happen often (at all?).

TL;DR:",  GF of 6 months won't give me a BJ. Says it makes her feel uncomfortable. Has anyone ever been in this situation before? Has it ever worked out for anyone?,"  Gf won't give head, never has, it will probably be terrible anyways. Other things good. Sex is important to me. Breakup?"

We've been going through a rough patch lately and she's recently told me that she wants a break. Her reasoning being that she is too dependant on me and needs to learn independence for herself. That she has to learn how to be okay without me. This really baffled me since I thought the point of a relationship is being and going through things together. I thought the point WAS to be able to depend on your SO. 

She says she's been thinking a lot about our relationship lately and listening to others about things (who knows what to possibly lead her to this) and she decided on a break. 

This shocked me completely. I'd have never thought she would do this. She's told me I was the love of her life and we've been through so much together. And I honestly just can't understand where she is coming from. 

To me this just feels like an excuse, but I don't know. I'm lost, torn, broken. I'm not sure how to feel about losing this girl. 

To me, her asking for a break was as if Mr. Rogers had just flipped everyone on his show off and burned his sweaters: You'd think that would never happen.

But it did, and now I'm stuck in a state of confusion and sadness. It really sucks. I'm not sure what to do or how to feel. 

Someone, please shed light on this situation for me. Is it over for good? Whats really going on here? What do?

TL;DR:",  Been with girl for over a couple years. She recently told me she wants a break because she needs to learn independence for herself. Confused and sad about it all. Need light on situation.,"  Things were seemingly going well when suddenly girlfriend of a few years wants a break from our relationship, and I just can't comprehend it."

TITLE: TIFU by trying to stand up in a loft bed while a fan was on at full speed.

POST: This actually happened on Saturday, but I'll get to the story. It's about 2 AM on Saturday and my SO and I are having a good time up in the loft bed. I'm on top and my SO asks me to spin around. Instead of spinning around as I usually do, I (like an idiot) decide it would be a better idea to stand up and get back on again obviously forgetting that the fan is on, at full speed naturally. 

As I attempt to stand up, the fan clocks me right in the side of the head just above my temple. My head whips to the side from the force of the blow and I fall down clutching my head. As I'm laying there trying not to cry, I hear me SO ask if I'm okay. I try to compose myself before asking and my SO asks me to please say something or at least make a noise.

My SO is freaking out because I might be knocked out and it would be weird to try to explain to our parents why I had to go to the hospital. Through gritted teeth I manage to say ""I'm trying not to cry"" as I sniffle and the waterworks start. My SO holds me and tells me it's okay and I'll be fine. Then we both start laughing after my SO says that even though it hurt, this has to be the funniest sex injury. But boy did that kill the mood. 

The next morning I wake up to a numb on my head about an inch or two long and about a half inch tall. Swallowing hurts, chewing hurts, yawning hurts, and basically anything that requires jaw muscles hurts. I think in a couple days my head wound will be completely gone, but I can manage a lot of things with a minor twinge of pain.

TL;DR:","  tried to stand up in a loft bed while a fan was on at full speed, head whips to the side and I fall down coughing and crying. Next morning I wake up with a numb on my head about an inch long.","  four days ago I stood up in SO's loft bed during sex while fan was on, ended up with a large bump on the head that has not fully healed."

TITLE: I feel like I was mocked by my college advisor.

POST: I took a break from college. Got some work experience, and this year I decided to go back. I have difficulties. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis when I was 17 and got it treated, but it's left me with severe stomach discomforts like IBS. I've found ways to manage my symptoms. Primarily each fresh foods, eat at certain times, and make sure I have a toilet ready at this particular time. If anyone else has dealt with this and can give me some advice on further treating or managing IBS those are definitely welcome.

Anyway, as my title read. I was talking to my advisor in his office today and I told him about my situation and told him that I have extreme difficulties leaving my house to attend 8am classes. He told me that I would have to ""go cry and beg to"" <insert chairman's name>. I feel like he mocked me and after dealing with IBS for 9 years I don't appreciate it. It has actually upset me a bit. I feel like I should man up, confront him about it, and tell him that I don't appreciate what he said. My first day of classes are tomorrow and I have a giant gap I can use to talk to him.

Fast forward to the summer I go and see him and I give him the game (along with a few other games that I don't play) He seems really happy so I go and watch him set it up. After he sets everything up he starts raging because the DLC passport for multiplayer is region locked meaning he couldn't play online. Being a gamer myself i seem sorry because I know that's why he plays games but he then try's to exchange it with a game store in another CITY!

TITLE: Me [28/m] with my [27/m] friend (2+ years). Did I mess up trust?

POST: So I have a close friend of mine of a few years who was talking to me about his girlfriend, and told me a few things. Said not to repeat it to anyone. Fine, no problem.

However, a random friend I have mentioned something about the girlfriend along the lines of ""hey shes cute! What do you think?"" (just random guy BS talk), I simply stated that ""you wouldn't really like her I think"".

He of course, asked why. I replied with ""just some things I was told in confidence, cant say"".

I feel like I screwed up. My friend of course dropped it, and that was it. It's just I feel I should of said something silly, or stupid, to blow it off, not what I did. It was the first thing I could think of without saying anything I shouldn't. Am I just being stupid here? I just feel bad about it.

TITLE: I [19 M] got dumped by my significant other [18 F] 3 months ago. She found someone in 2 months.

POST: We are both in college, but we went to different colleges and agreed that we will work things out for the long run. However after a month into our semester she called me and broke up with me out of nowhere because she didn't see us lasting forever. The first month was surreal, I didn't know what to do so I just ignored it. The second month I started drinking a lot especially by myself and my grades suffered a lot. 

Our winter break started and we live in the same hometown. So I wanted to hang out with her to see if I can change her mind, but wanted to wait till she had time to hang out with her friends and family as she usually leaves for a week for Christmas. 

I then got a text saying that she met someone a month ago and that they're dating. I'm heartbroken when she said this, worst of all is that I asked her if she can say that she doesn't love me anymore so I can start moving on but she said she has feelings for me and that she doesn't love the new guy (only a month into the relationship so I guess that makes sense). 

I want her to still be with me, I want her to give me a chance, I don't know what I should do. If I should give up on her then how do I move on? I've had insomnia the past couple of days and lack of appetite since she has told me.

TITLE: Losing a lot of weight has really made me understand why hot girls are so bitchy.

POST: I have recently lost a good amount of weight [cw 138 lbs. sw 205lbs].  I was a sweet fat girl and I'm still nice.  I've been getting a lot more attention from guys lately.  Recently I went to my SO's 10 year high school reunion where upon my husband was openly congratulated by a drunk guy for 'scoring' me. I thought this was super flattering and would never imagine in my wildest dreams this would happen to me in real life. I was having a reasonably good time until my husband decided he needed to go to the bathroom. I was sitting alone at one of the party tables playing a game on my iPod touch when ol' drunky comes up from behind and places his hands squarely on my shoulders and says, ""Where's your husband."" After telling him he's in the bathroom drunky says, ""Well that's too bad.""  In a super fucking creepy voice. So I move to shrug his hands off of me and they don't budge.  So I get up and start walking and drunky starts following me!  He stopped following me when I walk up to a group of guys talking.  At first I thought this incident was funny.  *Haha some drunk guy being silly* but then it really scared me.  I was practically invisible before , just another fat girl. But now, people see me, men see me and most of them are nice but some of them are definitely not.  I've never had to really fear for my safety until recently and it's truly bizarre.  I really understand why hot girls are such assholes all the time now.

TITLE: Me [26 MF] wants to break up with me after about [29 F] 5 years of knowing each other and several months relationship, wants to break up if I don't become a feminist.

POST: Last night I was talking with my girlfriend, things have been rough this month. Everything was going smoothly, nothing out of the ordinary and we began discussing about feminism. I don't actually remember how it came about that but it did. I asked her if she was a feminist and she responded with of course I am. We both live in separate countries (me USA) and my experience with feminism is extremely toxic, she lives in Sweden where its #1 country for feminism (I'm not surprised). She was saying things like how women get paid less, etc. Me trying to not argue with her, doing my best to be logical. She told me don't you want women to have equal rights? I'm like yes of course, but that doesn't make me a feminist. The word itself 'feminism'- isn't equality by itself, that is fighting for women's rights- I'm not going to go into that because that's just- another topic.

So after discussing about that she kept telling me, you're either a feminist or I'm breaking up with you. My brain 'blue-screening' figured she was just making up an excuse to break up with me but shes being dead serious I believe. Everything else makes sense, her attitude towards me at times or how I just want sex only, it really bothers me and I tell her that. I've been in a feminist relationship before and it was pretty toxic and feel like if I try to reason with her it's just going to end bad now, now that we know we aren't both feminists. 

I just don't know why I can't agree to certain aspects without calling myself a feminist cause I'm not, there are problems too with men's rights and not just women's.

TL;DR:","  girlfriend wants to break up with me if I don't become a feminist, everything else makes sense but the fact that she is so serious about it makes me uncomfortable. Why can't I just agree to disagree?","  GF wants me to be a feminist like her but I don't completely agree with feminism, agree that genders should have equal rights, gf wants me to be feminist or we break up."

POST: Towards the end of our relationship it just seemed like she was always mad at me. It got to the point where we would argue about literally everything. Her birthday just passed and I spent close to $400 on it, and yet she still had an attitude and gave me the hardest time and that when I realized that maybe we just are not on the same page anymore. 

Its been about 2-3 weeks since we split and at first I was okay but now I don't know anymore. The past 2 years of our relationship have been long distance since we both have gone away to college and I'm sure that has some affect on everything.

TITLE: Me [18M] with my girlfriend[19F] of almost two years, not sure about how I feel right now

POST: I've been dating X for almost two years now, but I'm undecided as to whether I want to continue the relationship or not. 

She's perfect on paper, intelligent, pretty, gets along with my family etc, but I'm not sure if my heart is in it any more.

She seems fairly intent on marrying me, but I don't think I'm ready to even fathom the idea, I think it's way too early and I don't even know if she's the one. I like her and I know she's quite the catch, but I'm not sure I'm ready to stay in a relationship until marriage. She brings it up quite often and seems to be really forcing the idea. Am I just feeling smothered? How do I remedy this?

I'm at a point in my life where my decisions mean a lot to the outcome of how the rest follows through. I'm deciding where I want to go to school, what I'll take, etc. I'm afraid that I'm not making enough of my own decisions and deciding what I want to be happy. 

Recently I've been in a bit of a funk and haven't really been as happy as I'm used to. There's nothing really devastatingly wrong in my life so far as I can tell. But I feel like something in this relationship isn't right and it's contributing to my depressed feelings.

We get along well, it's never been awkward, never felt forced until now.  I'm not really sure what started it but I don't think I'm in this relationship as much as she is and I'm questioning continuing it at all.

Is there any way for me to get back into a relationship I seem to have fallen out of? If not, how do I go about breaking up with her? I'm really just looking for insight into the situation and maybe another point of view. If you need more information just ask, I wasn't really sure what to put in here.

TITLE: TIFU By Thinking I Could Jump Off A Playground

POST: Ok like many other stories this was set a long time ago when I was a kid.

It was like any other day at school, at recess I decided I wanted to eat more now and have less at lunch so I put my lunchbox on the playground jungle gym sort of thing, at lunchtime I realised I never bought it back to class so I asked my teacher and left with another kid we'll call him Brian to go collect my lunchbox. The playground was surrounded by a row of hire huts that our school was using since the music area was being renovated. So I climb up the ladder to the top of the playground (It's really not that high) and collect my lunchbox, now I'm a badass so I decide Ive jumped off this thing before why not do it in front of Brian? So I go ""watch this"" and jump, I immediately feel pain I landed balls first into one of the ladder sticks, ""What the?"" I mumble I start to walk a few steps in front of a bunch of kids who watched this unfold they're asking if I'm ok. For some reason I can't here them I then just fell straight onto the floor, Brian just runs to go notify staff or something but I don't see him again. The crying begins I've realised what just happened and the pain is incredible, I get walked to the nurse and since she's a girl I have to self-examine myself it BLEEDING! WTF? I tell her and my Mum picks me up the shame is awful I get rushed to a emergency appointment at my local GP and that day of every 365 frickin' days a year they have a uni nurse, my GPs a man and the nurse is a woman, ugh... So my Mum says it's fine if they both examine my nuts really? They really couldn't do anything and they didn't want me on painkillers so I just had to wait... Later that year I had testicle torsion. I haven't reproduced and am not sure if I can anymore :(

POST: Everything seems to be going really great with my boyfriend. We've met each other's families, we're spending a lot of time together, we have sex regularly and things seem fine. I'm worried because this is the third time I've caught him sexting other women. 

He reactivates POF and OKC accounts, gets phone #s from ladies on there, deactivates the accounts and then sexts them. Each time he insists it's just to masturbate, that he has no real intention of emotionally investing in any of these women or meeting in person. I guess that's better than if he were actually meeting up with them, but i feel so betrayed and disgusted. He swears he will permanently delete his online accounts and contact info for these women and ""just watch porn like everybody else"" (his words). 

Am I being foolish to give him another chance? Does anyone have an experience like this where the person actually does change their behavior?

Anyway, when she was younger she was very active and quite small, however with age she has put on a pretty hefty amount of weight.

I've tried cat toys, and bought a harness thinking I could try to walk her but she just lays down and looks at me like I'm stupid. Basically I just want to know if you all have any suggestions for exercise or food. I care about her and don't want this to get any worse.

TITLE: Sister Issues

POST: So I've posted here before venting about my sister... as she hasn't been the nicest about my wedding planning/engagement. For example: having massive meltdowns about how everyone else's life is great except hers, constantly encouraging us to have a longer engagement for all sorts of reasons (including financial, saying we're too young, waiting until we have stable jobs... etc.)

My sister got engaged last weekend, and I'm super excited for her, but still honestly a bit annoyed, partially due to some of the ill feelings from events prior. Nonetheless, when she announced her engagement, nobody in our family was excited. Literally nobody. I think there are a lot of things feeding into this, including: she has been such a monster towards me, saying that this was going to be happening any time for the last 2 years, our family was literally the last people to know, her FH didn't ask my dad, and when they originally announced their engagement, they were planning on getting married in March (our wedding is in June).

After talking her today, for the first time after the engagement (like I said, bad feelings over other wedding stuff), she told me that our whole family was really shitty about it. My dad called her selfish, my mom freaked out because she was one of the last people to know, one of my grandma's basically yelled at her for being inconsiderate about my wedding. I have very mixed feelings about everything - I'm so excited for her, so I feel bad, because her engagement should be an extremely exciting time in her life. However, I look at it and see that to some extent she got what she deserved, even though I would not wish that upon her. So basically I'm having a lot of emotion about this and am really confused about how to feel.

Above all else, part of me wants to do something to help make her feel better about this all. Because I am excited for her, and want her to be able to be excited with me too. However, I really don't know what to do to help make this all better for her.

TL;DR:","  Sister has been incredibly shitty about wedding planning/engagement, including being inconsiderate to everyone involved.

On a new year's camp 2014-2015 I met a girl, who liked me (a lot), but I didn't quite like her back, I tried to get to know her since it's quite uncommon for girls to like me, the camp went on, we didn't quite click and I just acted like it was nothing special... But we got in contact immediately after the camp via WhatsApp (she lives over +50 km away or a 2,5-hour-trip via Public transport), and found out she likes me way, WAAAY more than I had thought, after a month of chatting and stuff I fell for her too. I met her twice after that, but I just didn't know what to do since she didn't show almost any signs of interest and/or I was too much of a pussy to do anything. I quickly after the second meetup just simply confessed to her, she still liked me according to her, but once I met her again nothing had changed, no signs of interest, no nothing (though this time her friend was with us). After which I was sick and tired of messing around and wanted to get things established and I simply asked if she would like to even be in a relationship, she said yes, after this and today when I saw her, still nothing has changed which has become quite frustrating for me, I just couldn't find the confidence to initiate anything, which is why I feel huuuuge regret of not doing anything. Should I even bother? I have no idea what I'm doing or what I'm supposed to do. She shows only little signs of interest. I can only see her a very limited time for very specific dates.

TITLE: Me [19 M] being falsely accused of cheating on my [19 F] girlfriend of 3 months, she seems to believe it and I don't know how to convey the fact it's completely incorrect

POST: Been with my girlfriend for 3 months now, and we're having some problems. To start off, I'm a guy who pretty much exclusively only has female friends, and my girlfriend knows this, and previously seemed okay with it. 

Recently one of her friends saw me on a night out with a group of girls, and told my girlfriend that I 'was all over' one of them. This wasn't true, the girl who told her already dislikes me and constantly gives me dirty looks etc. The girls I was out with were my 3 best friends, and I have absolutely no romantic attraction to any of them, plus they're all in relationships and I've been friends with them for most of my life so you can see why this irritated me.

Immediately my girlfriends attitude towards me seemed to change, she is already quite an insecure person so I immediately tried to reassure her, I told her I only wanted to be with her and noone else and after a few weeks everything seemed okay between us, and I thought I'd sorted it out.

A few nights ago, however, she told me there's been more rumours of my infidelity. We had a long phone call argument where I essentially told her (or tried to) that I never cheated, never will and I wanted to stay with her. She asked me whether I wanted to end it and I obviously said no. Some further background is that my last two girlfriends have cheated on me, so you can see how annoying it is to me to feel like I'm in the wrong without doing anything.

I just don't know how to get through to her that she needs to trust me and believe that I'm not a cheat, never have been and never will be. Any advice would be great.

TITLE: [25M] Just started my first serious relationship with my new GF [25F]. What kind of feelings should I be having?

POST: Just got into my first serious relationship with my new girlfriend (I'm kind of shy). Been seeing her about once a week for roughly 5-6 weeks now and we've been messaging each other multiple times everyday since the first date and only recently started being exclusive. We can be ourselves around each other and can talk about anything. However I don't think I'm experiencing that rush of love, that head over heels feeling that some people seem to have. Is this normal? Do some people just don't go through this phase? Is it because we only see each other about once a week (she lives almost an hour away)?  We've been very intimate but haven't had sex yet.
  
Although we can be ourselves with each other and talk about anything, we don't have that much shared hobbies (as far as I know at least). However that shouldn't be that weird since some people have good relationships this way (including some of my friends). Could this be why? If so what are some ways to get around this?  
  
Finally, how do I keep her interested and the relationship fresh? Spontaneous dates? Just be myself?

TITLE: TIFU by not making sure my rats couldn't escape.

POST: A little background, I have 4 rats; 2 albino, 2 black and white ones. In the last week or so, one of the albino ones (mind you, they are practically blind) has been learning to jump from her cage, which is three feet up, and then explore our room. We've tried a bunch of solutions that didn't work, but yesterday we switched out the table and thought now she wouldn't be able to jump down, and she didn't for about three hours.

This morning we wake up to find the glass of water on my desk (which is about 15 feet away from her cage, and about 3 feet off the ground) is tipped over and the water spilled onto my gaming pc. We found her under the bed and put her back.

Now, I open my PC and dry off the parts with a q-tip, the wires, everything is dry it seems. I turn it on, motherboard, GPU, CPU,

TL;DR:","  My blind rat learned to jump from her cage and explore our room, glass of water spilled on my gaming pc, everything is dry now.","  Didn't do a good job of not letting rat escape, she spilled my glass of water and fried my gaming pc hard drive."

I love cooking, and I love how big and bright and beautiful my kitchen is, but it's always so gross, and the sink is always filled with dirty dishes for days on end, and there's food caked on the stove, and it's like the people I live with are completely incapable of cleaning up after themselves. It's to the point where some of my pots and pans are scratched and damaged for sitting with food caked in them for days, and my baking pans are damaged beyond repair because of my lazy roommates. I don't want to move - I really like the space I'm living in, I've moved a lot in the past three years and dishing out first and last month's rent takes a huge toll on my meager savings. I just want to know if anyone out there has lived with roommates who don't seem to know how to do their dishes, and how they handled that, and if there were any successful strategies. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.

POST: On mobile and in a rush please forgive me

I need help. After a relationship of 2 years with a girl who I thought was honestly the one for me I get dumped for another guy for a second time. I know that if I take her back again it'll be another mistakes, I don't plan to either.

I feel worthless. Even after everything we did. All the time we spent together, she didn't find me good wnough. I tried so hard to make her happy. I did everything possible to make her feel like a queen. This is a fact, everyone I've talked to about this has said that I didn't do anything wrong and that it wasn't my fault. Even though I know that this is true My self esteem is destroyed. I'm usually a very chipper and funny person to be around according to my friends and right know I feel like they don't want me around because I can't be happy now. I want to know how to cheer myself up.

 I've tried distracting myself with almost everything I can but for some reasoning keep thinking about her and her new guy fucking. It's a guy wrenching feeling and for some reason my thoughts keep going back to that. He is more attractive.That he will make her happier. That he will please her better. That I am inferior in every way possible.  How can I stop thinking and picturing anything to do with her?

Another problem I'm having is that after being with her for so long and being in such a small town I feel like no one will take me. It is known that her and I we're together by everyone and I feel that I am now undesirable. That on top of the fact that I never really learned how to e single. Is there anywhere I can learn how to flirt. Learn how to at least not be completely inept with the opposite sex? Like an r4r but not physical. I know it's an odd question but it's something that I just thought

TITLE: TIFU by not washing my hands after hot wings.

POST: TIFU because my mom thought it was a great idea to try the new Atomic Hot Wings from a pizza place around here. Apparently the Hot Wings are so hot that you are required to sign a waiver before purchasing them. Knowing me, the hot sauce fiend - no problem! 

When she got home I immediately scarfed 3. They were EXTREMELY HOT WITH LITTLE TO NO TASTE, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. Either way, I felt manly as heck. I had hair on my chest and everything. 

Later, I lied down in my bed and I started feeling myself up for no reason (you know you do it!). All of a sudden I start feeling this wicked burning sensation which at first felt kind good...not so soon after. All of a sudden there is a massive burning which I can only explain to you as a volcano erupting from my urethra. I rush to the sink and I start pouring cold water on it to no avail, my lil guy was literally burning it down. 

After an hour or so it went away after much sitting in the shower and weeping for my sin - when I came out everyone knew what was going on. My sister thought it was a good idea to tell everybody in the house, and they're all calling me Volcano Dick now.

TITLE: I want to take my parents on a trip as a ""thank you"" gift. Where should I take them?

POST: A few years ago I quit my job to go back to graduate school. I knew going back to school would allow me to further my career but I also knew that during my time as a student I would have to live on a significantly lower income. There were some months where I just couldn't make rent, the car needed repairs, etc. My parents came to my rescue each time even though I knew they didn't have much money themselves (my mother is a nurse and my father is a civil servant). I am extremely thankful for them and I want to return the favor.

Now that I have finished school and gotten a great job in my chosen career I want to take them on well deserved vacation. Here are the rules:

1. They have never left the east coast United States so I would like to take them on a trip abroad. Domestic travel is ok too so I wouldn't mind hearing some suggestions.

2. My parents are still young and in good health so suggestions on physical/adventurous activities are greatly appreciated. However, I don't think they would like camping trips or roughing it in the wilderness for an extended period of time.

3. I want this to be a ""trip of a lifetime"" so I certainly don't mind spending money as long as they have a great time. We're not a very wealthy family though so let's keep the suggestions reasonable. 

4. Mostly I want a destination with a lot of culture, relaxation, interesting cuisine, and picture taking opportunities but I know that goes without saying.

Anyway, I hope you guys can help!

TITLE: Me [27F] with my boyfriend [31M] 7 months together, been thinking I need to leave the relationship.

POST: I want to start by saying my boyfriend is wonderful in most ways. I'm just starting to feel like I'm not a priority to him and at this point in our relationship, I think I should be.

For the first 3 months of our relationship we didn't go two days without seeing each other. Now we see each other about once a week. This isn't okay with me. I've made my concerns known for the past two months. His typical response is ""Really, lizabethbathory? This again?"" But nothing changes. I bring it up a lot because if I don't see resolution, it's still clearly a problem. I've explained to him that I feel like we should be spending more time together, and getting closer at this point in the relationship. His excuses are he works a lot (this is true), and he has sports, and also needs to see friends. I've met his friends, he's never met mine. We haven't met each others families. I've also expressed concern about this, as family is very important to me.

I've definitely fallen in love with him but I don't want to continue in this relationship when he's not ready to commit his time to me. The thought of life without him is terrifying to me. When we are together, I feel amazing. My soul feels happy. But we're apart more often than not, and that hurts my feelings pretty badly. I'm having a hard time leaving because I'm scared of my future without him in it.

TITLE: TIFU by not having any balls

POST: This is the harrowing tale of me and how I proved to myself that I don't have any balls.

So earlier on today I was at university. In one of my classes is a girl I like, but unfortunately due to the class, there is very little chance to talk to her. 
So the class in question is philosophy, which is very boring to sit through. At the end of the class the tutor says that he would like some of us to volunteer to present the next classes info to make it more interesting for us. 
I think to myself 'great this will be a good opportunity to show this girl how brave and confident I am' (ha). As I'm about to say that I'll do it, she jumps in and says she will do it!! 
Now, I know what you're thinking (because I was thinking it too) 'awesome, if I volunteer too then I will get the chance to work with her and get to know her a bit'. Well as the seconds tick by after her volunteering my brain shuts down. Literally I couldn't move or say anything. I tried, and failed, to volunteer myself up as tribute but didn't have the balls to say in front of everyone that I wanted to work with her. 

Ended up spending the rest of the day hiding in my car beating myself up for not having the balls to volunteer.

TL;DR:","  In a boring class, a girl volunteers to present next classes info, I can't say anything as I lack balls, spent the rest of the day beating myself up for not having the balls to volunteer.",  had the opportunity to partner up with a girl I like in class but freaked the fuck out and sat there like an idiot.

TITLE: Am I too much of a pushover?

POST: So, I've had a shitty week/month/year regarding women and I'm starting to think it's just me...
so, I'm 25 year old male and I've had this ex who had strung me along for over a year. She dumped me because she didn't love me anymore then dated someone else and came back to me for a year before I put a stop to it. I didn't talk to her for over 8 months and during that time I went on several dates, all ended with the first date and no second one. Then, I meet this girl, she goes on several dates with me and just cuts off contact and never responded to my text (no, I didn't blow up her phone, I just stopped texting her after she never responded.)
After not hearing from her for a month or so she text me out of the blue on wednesday, asking if I want to see a movie. I said yes and today, when we were going to see it, she told me ""I'm so bad, I saw it with my brother, I'm sorry"" I said no problem, we can do something else. Its turned into nothing but excuses so I just said fuck it, not going to push for it.
Now, today, my ex hit me up to hang out and talk. I said ok, we talk, go out to lunch and she said ""you promise you won't get mad?"" I told her to just say it. She said ""I'm dating another guy, but if it doesn't work out do you want to get back together?"" I just walked out without saying a word.
I have aspergers, but I'm very high functioning, just bad social skills. I feel like once the initial physical attraction wears off, I'm bland and boring. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or if it's not me. Are girls normally like this or have I just been unlucky?!?!
I'm ""very good looking"" from what I'm told so I think that's what scores me the dates, but my personality is shit. and yes, they know I have aspergers before I go on dates with them.

TITLE: Next-door neighbor making unsubstantiated complaints against my wife and I. Need advice.

POST: In January my wife and I moved into a town home so we could be closer to school/work.  Since we have moved in we have received three ""friendly"" reminders from the leasing office regarding: number of parking spaces used, our animal not being on a leash, and a noise complaint.  

We are alloted two spaces for our vehicles plus one for a guest.  Since we have moved in we have only had guests twice and both times they all came in the same vehicle. Add that to the fact that my wife and I work completely different shifts and the only time both our cars occupy our spots are from around 11pm-7am, otherwise one car is there at a time.  

Second, we received another reminder stating our dog was spotted off the leash and had defecated on another tenants patio.  This never happened.  Our dog uses training pads and the only time she is outside is on our closed in patio with us watching her.  

The noise complaint we got was on Super Bowl Sunday when we were out of town.  

I have had one interaction with our next door neighbor since we moved in and it was just a hello and goodbye.  I have no idea why she would want to do this. When we see her we always wave.  I've talked to the leasing office twice about it but they don't seem to believe me.  I don't know what talking to her would accomplish or if it would just make things worse. What I do know about her is that she never leaves her home and never turns any lights on. She also makes a habit of looking out her front or patio door every time I enter or leave my home.

POST: I am 36 years old. My longest relationship was in HS, lasted a little over a year. I have been through the death of both my parents and helped someone raise a child for a year before finding out it wasn't mine. I have done this with no one ""by my side."" I've grown, I've improved my life, I've found happiness and joy, strength in adversity, hope, etc... I didn't need someone to ""never abandon me"" or ""to stick with me"" while I did this. For the past year I have actively avoided dating with nothing but good results. My life is bigger, I've accomplished the majority of my goals, I've become a better man. 

My life seems to fall apart, however, when I try to date or romantically connect with someone.  Some people feel this makes me pathetically dysfunctional. Maybe they're right.

Last week the internet exploded with ""LoveWins"" and all I can think is ""Wins what? Every married person I know is miserable."" They've been cheated on, lied to, died on and disappointed. I hear constant complaints that they want out, they're only there for the kids, their SO has held them back, they wish they'd chosen differently. They can't agree on friends, activities, living arrangements, or sexual patterns. There is a constant stream of lamentation about how inconvenient and difficult relationships are.

I never hear people talk about what makes relationships worthwhile.

POST: Hello Reddit!  
I need some advice/support/encouragement regarding my girlfriends passport situation. She submitted a renewal application a couple months ago leading up to our trip in April, she got her old passport back and the enclosed documentation said she should receive the new one shortly. We kind of forgot about it and just checked last Friday (3/4) on the status, and USPS has the package marked as ""**undeliverable as addressed**"" on 2/23. There was no further tracking after that, so the USPS has no idea where it is and assume it was sent back to sender.  
We called the passport office and have been told a few things:  
  
1) Report the passport lost/stolen and request a new one  
2) Report the passport as undelivered and let the USPS and passport agency attempt to track it down.  
  
I have also heard of success in going to a local passport agency and getting an expedited one, but you cannot get an appointment until 2 weeks out of traveling abroad. We still have like 4 weeks until we travel, so i don't know if the agency will see us, and i don't want to wait until the last minute.  As of today (3/8) we have sent in a form to declare the passport undelivered, and they are supposed to be looking into it, but not sure what the outcome will be.

After my first flight I would then purchase a turbo charged Hayabusa street bike and take it to the desert and feel what it is like to drive 180 mph.  

Next I would purchase a massive yacht and begin to tour the world, stopping at places along the way and going backpacking to meet new people and see places and cultures, staying in hostiles and visiting pubs along the way.

Once I have accomplished several of these goals I would finally have the funds to dedicate all of my time and energy to my music.  Music is a part of me, I sing and play many instruments.

After making music and recording albums for several years I would likely become a humanitarian worker and spend the rest of my life teaching people how to build ovens and provide their children with proper food / how to get clean water / helping out the needy of the world.

Boy meets girl at college social event. Boy likes girl. Boy is unaware of girl's response to boy's potential advances. Boy is especially reluctant because of Forever Alone issues. So boy texts mutual friend of boy and girl to check if she might be keen, so he can act on rock-solid information.

Response: 'Sorry, Derp, she's my best friend. I'm not passing on anything that we share. **It's none of my business.**'

POST: Okay so I know the usual answer is ""she's trying to make you jealous... make a move"" but there's some backstory that changes things.

So I've known her since October. We met online (gaming) and she had a boyfriend at the time. Her and I fell for each other and became really close.

She's single now, and ""isn't really ready to let another guy close"". So she's not ready for a relationship. I've asked her about ""us"" and she told me she wants to remain friends ""for now"" but definitely still has a thing for me.

That was a month ago. She told me last night that her ex finally stopped messaging her and pining after her and that she was happy. 

The weird thing now is that she keeps telling me about other guys who hit on her. At first I thought she was trying to make me jealous, but I can't understand why she'd need to do that when she knows how much I like her + I try to _show_ her how much I like her quite often?

I don't know if I'm friendzoned as _fuck_ and she's telling me about _other guys_ or if she's trying to hint that she wants me to compete (even though she's always kinda put me on a pedastal for being _better than anyone before_). She said that these guys, and one guy in particular have expressed their feelings for her but she's told them that she never ever wants anything more than friendship from them. She also said that these guys are ""persistent"". She seems to see persistence as a good thing (she's mentioned that she liked persistence in past boyfriends).

Am I supposed to react in some way? All I said was ""I told you so"" because I often tease her about her online admirers. We were laughing about the whole thing at the time but now I can't help but feel like she was trying to _do_ something when she told me this stuff.

I decided, since I'm single, to write a note to her saying that I thought she was cute and good luck on her finals with my phone number at the bottom. I walked back to her study room, taped it to the glass wall, knocked on the glass twice to get her attention, and a few seconds after her seeing me, I walked off with my friend waiting around the corner. 

I ended up getting a text this morning around 8:30 from an unknown number saying ""Thanks. good luck on finals too"". I honestly didn't think it would work and I would never hear from her. I don't know her name, or anything about her but she is really pretty and I know I want to ask her out. 

My question is how should I respond seeing as we don't know each others names or anything about each other, other than we probably go to the same school.

TITLE: How can I [25 F] deal with my romantic friend [24 M] when I need alone time?

POST: I have been dating this guy for maybe a month. We aren't in a serious relationship, just dating here and there. I'm not in the mood to be in a serious relationship now.

In the last week he has been texting me a whole bunch, enough to make it somewhat annoying (10 texts every hour or something. I reply here and there). I just don't want to talk to him all the damn time. I want to hang out with my other friends and such.

Just today, I was playing this online game with another friend. First time I got to play in a couple days, and when he sees me online, he watches me play the game itself (the game has a ""spectator"" mode, which means people can watch you play), and keeps asking me to play against him. About a couple hours later, he gives up and says ""fine, guess not"" which makes me feel bad. I really just want to play by myself right now (or with my other friend, whom I haven't talked to in a while). Honestly, him watching me play in spectator mode kind of felt like someone watching what you're doing over your shoulder. It felt kind of uncomfortable.

How can I deal with someone like this? I want to keep dating the romantic friend, but this is sort of starting to get annoying. I'm not sure how to explain without being rude.

Another thing to note: He was virgin when we met and we had sex a couple times. He was really nervous about it, so it wasn't good sex. Not a big deal to me at all. I want to make sure I can be as nice about the talkative issue as much as possible, and make sure he knows it isn't about the sex or whatever.

TITLE: [22/M] girl in the group...awkward scenarios

POST: Hello reddit,

So earlier in the year an old school friend of ours came into the group with a long distance BF and nobody was really bothered but soon the ""hatin'"" came up. After a while she broke up with the guy and I watched as some in my circle tried for her. Initially I wasn't interested but she is genuinely good so I tried for it. Everything went well till she flaked on me so I moved on, found out later it happened to another who tried the kiss-ass method...

Fast forward and everyone still hangs out but theres a veil of passive aggressive and I see folks still going for her. To make things worse one friend keeps obsessing over her in my presence and it hits at my underlying loneliness since I never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with but I don't know how to go about dealing with the consequences of such a move.

TITLE: My [22F] boyfriend [24M] keeps physically hurting me ... am I overreacting?

POST: My boyfriend keeps getting physical with me when he's upset. The first time he really injured me was just a few days ago and it took me until tonight to talk to him about it.

He pinched and twisted my fingers until I started crying and asking him ""why would you do this to me?"". Yes, I was purposely annoying him while he was driving (touching his face) but I thought I was being playful and goofy. 

When I brought it up with him tonight he made it clear he meant to hurt me and offered justification rather than an apology. Finally after I explained ""You are my boyfriend. You should never want to hurt me. You should feel awful if you hurt me. You should be upset at the thought of me being hurt"" he apologized and I thought it had sunk in.

Just a little while ago I was teasing him and he dug his fingers into the back of my head, pushing me down. He did this in front of a mutual friend which makes me think he doesn't realize the gravity of what he's doing.

We do horse around a lot but if someone expresses they are hurt it stops immediately. This feels different. This feels like he's purposely hurting me, even if it's not overly violent.

Am I over reacting? I've never had a boyfriend behave like this with me before. I don't know how to approach this subject considering we **just** talked about it.

We've been together for 2 years and he's never behaved like this in the past but I have no intentions of putting up with this in the future/letting it evolve.

TITLE: Me [25M] with my ex-boyfriend [25M], he is texting me to tell me about the people he is planning to sleep with this weekend

POST: I just need to get this off my chest.

I dated my ex for about 6 months before my kidneys failed and I had to start dialysis (11 months ago). I told him that my first priority was myself for the time being, and didn't think I could really commit to a serious relationship. We hooked up a few times after, but while I was on dialysis, I felt really self-conscious (I had a tube coming out of my stomach) and was generally pretty tired and not that interested in sex.

We stayed pretty close, and I had a kidney transplant 2 weeks ago so I should hopefully be returning to some form of normalcy soon. Before I had my transplant, he told me he didn't want to put any pressure on me, but he would like to continue the relationship when I was better if that's what I want to as well. In any event, he said he at least wanted to stay close friends. I still really love him and do want to pick things back up, and I told him that. 

But tonight, he started texting me that he was going to sleep with another guy (including sending a picture of the guy), and then told me he is planning to have a threesome tomorrow night with two really attractive guys. 

Am I being too sensitive? I don't really care if he sleeps with other people right now, but I don't want to hear about it. I just don't understand why he would tell me this, or if he was just leading me on a few weeks ago when he said he would like to continue the relationship. I understand it's kind of a weird situation so I don't want to be too judgmental of him. Should I just tell him I don't want to hear about this? It just seems kind of insensitive.

POST: So my girlfriend and I broke up about 2 weeks ago, but we haven't stopped talking since then. She told me she wanted to be a ""thing"" which wasn't too serious at all, but meant we would try and only want each other. She goes on vacation to the beach where many of our friends, including my best friend is there. I tell her I can't be just a thing with her because I want more. So the next day she gets drunk and tries to hookup with my bestfriend, he declines thankfully. She calls me about 45 minutes after it happens asking to get back together and then telling me what happened. I blew up on her, and was completely outraged. Then later in the night after a long fight of freaking out on her, I couldn't fight the feeling I still wanted her. Should I forgive her and try to work things out? Let me add she and all her friends said she missed me so much and wanted me back. My best friend was talking to her about our relationship for me, and that's when she asked him from being drunk and her excuse of ""missing me"" is why she did this.

TITLE: Me [22 F] I drive myself crazy when in a relationship

POST: I think I have unresolved issues, but I don't know what they are.
The problems I have, only surface when I'm in a relationship. At the beginning I'm sort of in love, but after a while I'll doubt.
When I'm longer in a relationship I'll just doubt it the whole time, but when the relationship ends I'm really really hurt, like dying from emotional pain hurt. While when before I'm like: no, if he breaks up with me nothing would change much.
I do not seem to realize how much I care for someone until that someone breaks things off. I'm confused by my emotions.
Oh, in the relationship I also tend to get very critical (like, nothing is good enough?I'll think he's is too clingy and then he changes that and I'll be like ' You ignores' me too much'. Or I just don't like how he looks, talks, laughs, I seem to search for things). 
I'm a person who constantly tells how she feels. So everything I doubt the relationship, I'll bring it up and the my SO just feels really shitty and doesn't know what to do, but I don't know what to do either. And I can be really bitchy (I'll lose my temper quickly). It also may come because I can't handle stress and pressure?  When I'm happy I'm less critical, but when I'm feeling depressed I'm doubting everything, especially my SO. I don't think anyone CAN help me, but I just wondered if there were more people feeling like this? And if there are more people, how do you deal with this?
I also thought I might just be getting cold feet because 'I choose an SO' and will be 'stuck' with that person forever when there could be someone else for me who's better. Maybe I just watched too many Disney movies.

TL;DR:","  I have unresolved issues when in a relationship, especially when the relationship ends. I tend to be critical and bitchy when in a relationship.

POST: As I was walking to work today, I see a seedy looking character holding a bag running towards me. Roughly 15 meters behind him there was a lady chasing him.

I immediately assumed the bag he was holding was the woman's purse and he was robbing her. Thinking quickly, I attempted a Good Guy Greg and went to stop the guy as he ran past me. However, my best intentions were all for naught, as he completely knocked me over.

Instead of him trying to keep on running, he started yelling at me and repeated that 'he should punch my face in'. Turns out, he was actually running to stop the bus and that the lady behind him was his wife.

I apologized, (still lying on the ground) and got up and went to work. haven't told anyone in person because I'm too embarrassed because I was an idiot, and because I almost got beaten up.

TITLE: Don't piss off your younger brother...

POST: I only recently found this subreddit and I am hooked so I'd thought i'd share my story..

First off, this happened about 5-6 years ago so parts may be a little hazy.
A bit of a background story to why I did this... My older brother would always annoy me by doing stupid little ""pranks"" and one day while I was eating dinner he thought it would be hilarious to pull my chair from underneath me (the oldest trick in the book). 

So i decided that enough was enough and needed to plot my revenge. Given that I have more intelligence than he has and could only come up with old tricks, I wanted to put some thought into getting my revenge. One thing I noticed was that when he came back from work after a long day, he would always launch himself onto his bed to relax.

One day when he went to work, I spent about an hour or so turning everything (figuratively speaking) in his room upside down including all his pictures, alcohol bottles on his table, his TV (don't know how you can't notice this), posters and most importantly his bed.....yeah flipped it over so the base was on top and the mattress on the floor. I then remade his bed to make it look as normal as I possibly could so he wouldn't suspect a thing.

Then I waited with much eagerness to fulfill my revenge and around 2 hours later he arrived home and surely enough went straight to his room. As my room was next to his, I was being as quiet as possible so he didn't know I was home and so I could hear my work coming to life.

That's when the inevitable happened......all I heard is a scream followed by a WTF!! Turns out the force of him landing and the hard impact onto the ""hardened mattress"", he also smashed his head. It wasn't until I came in laughing my ass off with a shit-eating grin from my proud work that he had also realised that everything else in his room was upside down. He then had to spend the next 1-2 hours putting everything back up the right way much to his annoyance.

Lets just say he stopped annoying me after that.

TITLE: My friends think I'm using my BF for sex...but I think I found the ""one"", what do you think?

POST: I met my boyfriend in Dec 2011 at our university.  We had sex shortly after we met (not my brightest idea) and I just felt like he was the only guy i've connected with ever (this includes all my previous boyfriends).

However, previous to him, I had had sex once.  Now with him I have it every other day basically.  It took us a few months to get me to be able to orgasm (first ever!!) but since then sex has been overly satisfying!  My friends think I only love my boyfriend for the sex.  It is true we have sex a lot for college kids, but I really feel like I want to spend my life with him.

We understand eachother so well, I feel like I never have to say things with words around him because he usually knows how I am thinking.  I am not as well with reading him, but then again I just suck at being with men in general.  It has taken me a while to get around to some of his ways of life (his music, sports, style) but now I love him more than ever-I love him more everyday.  I have grown to love the music he likes (country in case you're wondering) and still working on the trapshooting and motorcycling.  

I really do want to spend my life with him, I want to marry him even though I prefer my last name to his...but I'm sure in time I will like it ;)

Anyways, from what I have said here, does it sound like I'm using him for sex? One more tidbit of info: we are currently an hour apart while on summer break, so we don't see eachother much but we talk hours a day and text 50 hours a day.  We see eachother every couple weeks and if we want to (which lets be honest we are like sooo horny for eachother) we have sex.

TITLE: My [16 F] best friend [18 M] got a college girlfriend and doesn't speak to me anymore.

POST: Throwaway since he knows my username.

So my friend (let's call him Jake) left for college a few months ago. Jake has been my best friend for the last couple of years, and I took it pretty hard when he had to leave. He promised to visit every so often, and we still texted/ facebook messaged quite often. We cared a lot about each other; we helped each other with our problems and he was just a lot of fun to be around. 

However, maybe two or three months after he left, Jake got a girlfriend. 

She seemed really awesome and since this was his first girlfriend, Jake was over the moon. He told me everything about her. And I honestly could not have been happier for him. 

It started getting a little frustrating when Jake would visit, as he would be texting his girlfriend the **entire time.**

Not even exaggerating. I would be talking to him, and he would just nod his head and stare at his phone. 

I didn't want to bug him about it; I knew that he was happy about having a girlfriend and they seemed really good together. But slowly, the facebook conversations stopped. He didn't visit anymore. And every single time I tried to talk to Jake, he was with his girlfriend. 

The last conversation I had with him, I asked if he didn't like talking to me anymore, or if he was tired of me. He said no, but we haven't talked since. 

I did see him one more time after that over Christmas break at a game night a bunch of my friends were at, but he brought his girlfriend with him and he didn't even look at me. 

Since the majority of my friends have left for college, I've been incredibly lonely. Losing my best friend has just made everything worse, and I can't think about him without getting super upset. As far as I know, it wasn't anything I did that made him stop talking to me, but I can't help but feel that it's my fault. How do I get my best friend back?

*Answer: You're free to do what you like. We're not chaining you here. -silence-*

POST: So my BF (25M) and I (24F) have been together for three years and we have been living together for about two years. 

Everything has been great, the relationship is fine. It's been convenient that we've lived together because his car had broken down and we have been fortunate enough to get by using only my car. He's able to walk to school and use my car to get to/from work. 

Now the opportunity for him to get a car has presented itself and he is considering moving back into his parent house to save money. He wants to stay together, but doesn't want the financial responsibility f living in an apartment. 

I'm devastated for multiple reasons. One being that he'd move out and I love having him around to come home to. And two, because although he doesn't pay much rent/utilities he does help out and the money he gives me every month definitely helps me get by. 

In my eyes it seems selfish to move out when I know he'll just be over all 
the time anyway like he was before he moved in. Except now he won't be ""living"" with me so won't have the financial burden. He says he wants to live with me but has to look out for his best interest. But what about mine? The biggest reason I'm still in this damn state is because I love my bf and want to stay until he done school so we could start our lives elsewhere. 

I've sacrificed a lot for him, and now I feel like he's just looking out for what's convenient for him. 

Barring the financial stuff it really hurts my feelings he'd want to move out in the first place. I feel like him moving out is like backtracking in a relationship. And I wonder if it will suffer because of it.

POST: I met a girl 10 months ago on r4r. Good times, bad times, and okay times, and everything in between have been had. I love her with everything that I am and our relationship is wonderful. However I am not a good boyfriend, a good worker, or a good anything for that matter. She is everything that any person could ever want and I want to say goodbye so she can survive without this burden that is me. 

She reads these forums and since I am a slight coward when it comes to goodbyes the impersonal post may be the best. 

I love you Sarah. Please continue being awesome.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] of 8 months, I'm having a problem with her believing and i don't know why

POST: Hello Reddit. Thanks in advance for reading my post and thank you so much for answers. I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months and we love each other so much and i can't imagine myself without her.

I'm not beliving in god, and she is christian. Her religion is not causing any trouble actually. She don't talk about it with me and she accept i don't believe. I can't really explain my problem. I just feel a bit scared about religions in general after watching movies and documentaries about religions and how they can in some cases be very bad. I know these movies is taken to the extreme, and that most religions are nice, but still they scared me because i'm for some reason generelising all religions which is totally wrong.

Not only movies changed my mind, but also other people telling bad stories. I'm not as open-minded as i used to be. And i just want to be, i really wish i could just not think about it.

Everytime i think about her believing i get a bad feeling inside. I have tried to talk with her about it, but it makes her sad. I know that Christian people are good people, and i really don't know why i feel this way. I want to be more open-minded. I want, but don't know how. How can i stop this bad feeling inside me?

POST: I am in the Navy and stationed domestically, but several states away from home. I came home for a couple of weeks, had a lot of sex, and now she's pregnant (according to a test she bought).

My dad, my stepmom, their son (my half brother), and everyone they interact with dislike her for stupid reasons. My mother loves her to death.

I am scared to tell my family. I am scared that my family will disown me. My dad's family has disowned his sister, and I am afraid that they might do the same to me one day.

I am scared that I'll be like my mom and either become an alcoholic or leave my child. And it wouldn't be hard being so far away from home.

I am scared that my girlfriend and I will grow up and hate each other or be forced into a marriage we're not ready to be in yet.

I am scared I'll be a failure. I just got into the Navy, got into my first command recently, and I'm afraid my performance and everything will go to shit.

I'm afraid I won't ever go to college and get a good job. I'm afraid that I'm leaving my girlfriend with a kid at home and she'll resent me for still being able to pursue my career and ambitions, and she's at home taking care of a baby instead of following her own dreams.

I'm scared people will make fun of her for getting pregnant so young.

however, he called me this morning and asked me to come visit him after all, and that he didn't care what happened after, as in the emotional after-effects of seeing each other again.

TITLE: I desperately want to leave my job. Looking for advice

POST: Thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read/reply to this. Last August, I (29M) started working full time after a LONG period of unemployment. Before that I worked freelance as a graphic/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there. I miss the freedom that came with freelance work, but having a steady paycheck is certainly nice. It's very tough to find a job in my area, so on one hand I feel lucky to be in the situation I'm in, but on the other I feel like I can do much better.

Anyway, I met this girl last summer in South America.  (We are both from the US).  From the second I met her, I immediately thought that I had never seen anyone as gorgeous as she was.  I'll spare you the gooey details, but just assume that I became immediately crazy about her.  We became really close while we were there, but our vacation ended with an abrupt halt after two and a half weeks.  I was madly distraught on the plane flight home, and was a wreck for weeks over how much I missed her, and how sad I was that I never really told her how I felt.  I told some of my friends, and they all said that I would get over her in due time.  Well, it has been over a year, I haven't seen her in person the whole time, and I'm still as, if not more, crazy about her.  The only times I really get to talk to her are our rare Skype ""dates,"" but other than that, nothing.  We were so close in South America, but I don't know if she still feels the same way that I do.  How do I tell someone I haven't seen in over a year that I am still crazy about them?

TITLE: Me [34 F] with my partner [36 M] 5 yrs, kinda bored, are we settling?

POST: So we've been together for a bit and we're solid house partners and friends. No drama, v. little fighting. We split housework and financial responsibilities. We're both gainfully employed, me teaching middle school, him teaching college. The small tussles we get into are pretty easily managed--usually just grumpy sniping at one another, pretty infrequent. 

Sounds perfect, right? We've been talking about kids-- I'm at the age where I kinda need to fish or cut bait. I'm into it, but not, like, chomping at the bit. 

Here's the thing. We're not very, well, INTO each other. We had constant sex when we were first together and now it's infrequent-- though still good when it happens. We spend a lot of free time doing things separately, and sometimes it feels like we're just roommates-with-occasional-benefits. I grew up with parents who were relentlessly practical about relationships and I feel like I've kind of settled into their pattern.

When we talk about kids, sometimes there's this little tiny voice that kind of goes, ""Um, do you really want to be in this relationship forever?"" I'm the sort that becomes more like the person I'm with than I think is good for me-- being with him is drama-free, but it's also pretty sedentary and not very spontaneous. I had two awesome, adventurous parents and I loved my childhood. I worry that we're sort of bad influences on each other. Also, the thought of co-parenting with an ex sounds awful (no offense to folks who are divorced or had divorced parents).

Am I crazy to complain? At my age, shouldn't I be happy to be with a drama-free friend who's also a good partner? Or if I go into it bored, will it get worse?

TL;DR:","  Been with partner for 5 yrs, no drama, but not very into each other. We talk about kids but rarely act on it. Is this settling?

POST: So I've ""known"" this girl since like middle school, but we never talked until I started messaging her on Facebook recently. I would just spark up short conversations here and there asking her questions about our common career path of nursing.

However, last night I actually felt like our conversation was more than what it usually is. The feeling became more friendly and informal. We talked longer than usual too and even agreed literally at one point that we should ""be friends"" and ""hangout."" I told her we should even get lunch at one point.

Here's the thing, I've been single for 2 years now and I'm a bit attracted to her.

I've been contemplating whether or not I should pay for our first lunch as well. I don't want to creep her off, so I'm not sure what I should do? Should I strictly keep it platonic? Won't this automatically friend-zone me if I ever want to start something in the future with her?

POST: I'm soon to graduate, and have had a few interviews with companies all in rapid succession. All have gone well. I got an offer on one very quickly, and feel very confident about the other two. 
The one I got an offer on is basically my backup plan. It'd be a fun position, but it's lower pay than what the other jobs would be, fairly significantly (10-15k, if not more). I delayed them as long as I could; I was told by one to expect an answer within 2 weeks, and 2 1/2 weeks later, I've heard nothing (contacting their HR recruiter after the 2 week mark just got me the answer that ""they're still deciding""). 
I can't afford to be unemployed on graduation, so I went ahead and accepted the position on the last day I was given to make the decision; I stalled them as long as I could knowing it wasn't my first choice. I also know I can't count on the other two jobs coming through. That said, if either of the other two come through, I'll almost certainly tell the company I accepted an offer from that I changed my mind and take the other offer.
How badly would this be burning a bridge? Are there other potential negative repurcussions that I'm not considering? I really didn't want to do it, but, from my POV, I didn't have much of a choice if I was going to make sure I had a job lined up.

TITLE: What could be causing this 'Phantom Smoke' smell?

POST: Age: 18 Sex: Male

Duration: Half a year more or less

I've been smelling smoke that isn't there for a while now. I can never seem to pinpoint a cause or even a correlation. It just comes and goes randomly. They're very brief smells, but they can be very strong.

I got it checked out by a GP in November last year, who then recommended I go see an ENT. ENT isn't free until January.

Fast forward to January, I see the ENT. He checks my ears, nose, and throat. He cleaned my ears, and stuck a thing (don't know what it's called) up my nostrils to check for tumors in the nasal passage. Everything was clear, and he figures it might be a damaged nerve. He said that it might fix itself in time. Which didn't make sense to me since the smells have gotten more frequent and stronger, yet still random.

Tells me to get a CT scan done just to be sure there are no tumors. Got the CT scan done, fast forward a week or so, got a call from the ENT and says that it's all clear. No tumors.

No tumors is great, but surely there's a definitive answer as to what is causing these phantom smells, right?

I've read up about migraine auras and how they usually come before a migraine, but I ruled that out since I don't get migraines after the smell happens.

TL;DR:","  Phantom smoke smell for half a year now. Been checked out by ENT, everything checked out fine. CT scan showed no tumors.

Before we made our relationship official, I did bring up his living situation and he told me he only moved back to her house a year ago after he and his long term ex broke up. He told me that he's saving money and plans on getting his own place soon. That was over 7 months ago. 
I've never seen him look for a place or a room mate or even mention it. I also have doubts that he's saving money because he waits tables and talks about being low on money. 

NOW, so you don't think I'm being a shallow, bitchy girlfriend, I do want to add some of his backstory...
I know that he can get a better job than the serving position he has at a restaurant. He was in the Air Force for 4 years and decided not to reenlist. I don't blame him for that because he saw a lot of fucked up things while he was deployed. He now has the opportunity get paid to go to school (with the GI bill) or he could get a contracting job that pays well.  
Am I in the wrong for wanting him to use his full potential? I feel like he is so unmotivated but I don't want to offend or nag him about it...he's pretty sensitive. I could easily see myself marrying this guy but this is definitely something to think about for our future.

TITLE: Conflicted.

POST: Hi reddit,

I am a 30/m and I've been in a relationship for 6 years with a girl younger than me, but not by much. I love her. She is the most pure, kind person I'll ever meet. She understands me, I understand her and we have always considered each other soul mates. I am very, very lucky.

What brings me here, then?

Last weekend, I went out for afternoon drinks with some friends. They all left quite early in the evening and I decided to stay out drinking on my own. Not usual for me at all but I've been feeling a bit jaded in general lately.

I ended up meeting a girl at one bar I went to and I felt that same damn spark I haven't felt in a long time. She knew about my relationship from the start and nothing physical happened between us. We just spent hours talking and going from bar to bar with some of her friends. The subtext wasn't as innocent however.

In addition to a good dose of well-deserved guilt, I am now completely conflicted. Everything I thought I knew isn't. Or, I was in denial and the truth just hit me in the face. Or, nothing much happened but I was so drunk it seemed amazing. I'm not sure what to believe.

This girl gave me her number, ""if ever things should change"". I threw it out in a panic when I got home and the trash had gone when I went back to get it. Part of me is happy about that. Part of me really wants it back even though I'm not sure what I'd do with it.

I don't necessarily want a relationship with this other girl. I *really* don't want to end my current relationship. All I know is I would like that feeling of excitement in my life more often.

Can anyone offer some advice?

TITLE: My [22 M] girlfriend [18 F] of 3 months was manipulated into breaking up with me. Advice needed.

POST: Before my girlfriend and I started dating she (in her words, kinda) liked a guy named Bill. Her and Bill never worked out due to age differences of what I am understanding.  I start dating her shortly after and things seemed to be going smoothly.

Fast forward 3 months, she tells me that she wants to break up. She says that our relationship isn't as close as she would want and doesn't feel connected. She also tells me that she has been feeling this way for 2 weeks. I respond by telling her to think about it (since this type of situation can be worked out) and if she still feels the same way I'm not going to be angry or anything about her breaking up with me. I completely felt at fault and tried to think about when I was being distant with her.

The next day I talk to her the story COMPLETELY changes. This time she tells me that Bill told her that our relationship is flawed and we seem distant (we all work at the same place.) He apparently convinced her that I was not right for her.  She also tells me that he ended up kissing her about a week before this.  She also adds that she started to like him during this same time frame. She emphasizes that she fell for me though and truly does not want to break up. 

I was more upset that she wouldn't tell me that she had any issues with our relationship and instead bypassed communicating with me just to break up.

She tells me that she isn't talking to Bill anymore and, again, that she fell for me.  

I'm a not very knowledgeable when it comes to relationships but I personally feel that if she can't voice her problems to me, there is probably a problem.  I also feel that if she can be this easily manipulated, there also might be a problem.

On one hand I want to give her the benefit of the doubt because I truly do enjoy spending time with her. But on the other hand this type of situation could've easily been avoided with some common sense to just talk to me.

I would love to hear any thoughts because at this point I'm just trying my best to figure out the best solution.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend of 3 months was manipulated into breaking up with me by a guy she apparently liked. She says she still loves me but feels our relationship isn't as close as she would like. Advice needed.,  Girlfriend breaks up with me.  Turns out she was manipulated by her (slight) crush.  No idea were to go from here.

TITLE: Gee, thanks for inviting me.

POST: I invited this girl to a theme park with me. Things got a bit strange there, as we held hands together and she grabbed me and hugged me on a couple of rides. After the theme park she goes, ""omg thanks for the best theme park trip ever <3 :)."" The next day she asked me to go to some youth thing her church is having. I said sure and she went on and on about how ""this meant a whole lot to her"" and how ""we're gonna have a great time :)."" I thought it was gonna be fun too, but at the actual thing she left me alone to my own devices, with total strangers (I wasn't sure about going for THIS EXACT REASON.) The next day was worse... She brought another guy with her and not only did she ignore me and ditch me again, she started getting all touchy-feely with this guy. Gee, I can see how much my presence means to her... I know we aren't actually dating yet or anything but man, that sucked big time to see her like that. I am contemplating not going anymore (its a week-long event) but the discussions and ""sermons"" are actually enlightening and to not go would basically ignore the teachings of said sermons - but I don't know if I really would enjoy seeing her like this and what effect it will have on my feelings in the long run (so far I feel hurt and neglected...)

POST: I loaned my sister $200 because her pay from the military was delayed when all that was happening a little while ago.   

On Black Friday she called me and let me know she just got me a really great gift. I told her I didn't know what I was getting her, but not to spend a lot, and she said ""Oh you don't have to get me anything else, you've already got me something. Don't worry, the gift is worth the money"" or something like that, saying she spent the same amount that I spent on her.

It's conflicted me ever since and I don't know what to do- $200 is a lot of money for one Christmas gift, as that is what I was planning to spend on my family altogether. But also, $200 is a lot to spend on ME. I never told her it was a gift, and we talked about when she would pay me back at the time I loaned her the money.

Should I say something? Ask her to return it? Are Black Friday deals returnable?

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my best friend [18F] she's wanting to get back with an ex, unsure how to react?

POST: I'll start with the basics. Me and my best friend (Call her Rose from now on) have been really close friends since September now. Several people have even assumed us as being in a relationship before we are that close.

She started going out with a pretty good guy in October, it was long distance though and just didn't work out so she broke up with him before New Year. 

Hardly a week later she gets a message from one of her ex's who she went out with before me and Rose met. From what she has told me she was really happy with him. He was great in many ways for her, they had good chemistry basically. But he dumped her after 9 months because they hadn't had sex yet. Rose told me that had he waited she feels like they would still be together even now. She clearly really likes this guy still and I want her to be happy.

But I can't shake off this feeling that he's a scumbag. I just think it's despicable to dump someone just because they want to wait a bit longer before they're comfortable to have sex. Surely if you really cared about them and not just about the sex you'd wait a bit?

For a bit of context this is the UK, so legal age is 16 and they were 16/17 at the time of their relationship.

So what should I do? I want her to be happy, but I think getting back together with this guy, even if she was in a very happy relationship with him previously, is the wrong thing for her to do.

POST: I have a four year old Cairn Terrier, and for the first year and a half of his life, he was perfectly fine around other dogs. I would even have friends bring their dogs into my house, and he would be fine. I went back to school for my senior year of college, and when I came home for break, my mother explained that he just growls and snaps at other dogs whenever he sees them.

He seems to be fine with dogs his own breed and even terriers around the same size, but having him lunge at a random dog across the street when I walk him is something I can't deal with anymore. On top of that, I was hoping to be able to get another rescue, but obviously I can't do that until he calms the hell down. I've started being more forceful about establishing myself as Alpha and making sure he walks correctly on lead, and have even gotten him to stop barking on the few occasions we run into dogs on his walks by focusing his attention on me. I'm just looking for more advice on how to do this. He was completely fine before, and I'm hoping to help him get to that point again, but I have no idea how to start.

POST: So I met this girl about half a year ago. We got along great. On the third or fourth time hanging out we had sex, I lost my virginity to her. We dated for a little while 1-2 dates. But we established that we're just friends. We did have sex a few more times after that, but have stopped (been a month or 6 weeks or so) 

Well I've been crushing on her friend, like I just think about her all different hours of the day. I asked my friend about three months ago if she would be okay with me dating her best friend. She got upset, but she knew I wasn't hers, and did get over it. But she said she would be okay with it, so long as she didn't hear/know about it. Well last night me and her best friend hung out last night. Actually it was the three of us, and she left, leaving me and her friend at the hookah bar together. We just chilled and talked. It was really great, she seemed to have been enjoying herself quite a bit. I feel like its the wrong thing to do, to want her. But I know myself to an extent.

I've been liking her for many months, I think she knows very well that I do like her, because half this time I made many attempts to be with her.  
She now is my friend (we share friends) and I know she cares for me. I don't want to be one of those persons that complains about the ""friendzone"", I like being her friend but it hurts sometimes.

I feel guilty for not having the courage of asking her for a time alone last night and said all these things. Also, I'm trying to be more confident, and I feel that taking the ""easy"" way of writing would be counterproductive.

TITLE: I'm [18 M] having difficulty interpreting signals from a girl I'm interested in [18 F] who has limited English skills (Thai)

POST: For the past few months, I've been intermittently attempting to court a classmate of mine. We see each other every once in a while and we have built up a pretty solid rapport. The issue is that she can be incredibly hard to read. It's difficult to tell if her over-friendliness is flirting or if she is compensating for her verbal impediment. Since her first language is Thai and she struggles with English (able to hold a conversation but often misses a lot of information), I've had to adjust my way of speaking and it's difficult to talk to her with the confidence I'd normally have. At one point, I tried to ask her our, but halfway through, it became clear that she didn't know I was asking her out so, out of embarrassment, I backed away from the subject.

I'm usually not the sort of person to be bold and direct when it comes to these things, I'd only ask someone out if I were sure they were at least a little interested in me. If she were any other girl, I'd be certain she was interested. But the amount of factors that come into it are ridiculous. I don't know what to expect from her. I don't know what sort of guy a Thai girl would be interested in (if I could make such a sweeping generalization) or what the differences in dating customs are. And I can't tell if she has a genuine interest in me or if the ""signals"" I get are her using body language to compensate for her English skills.

I'd appreciate any advice on approaching the situation (whether it's specific to ELL relationships, Thai culture, or just dating in general).

The other day I was working as the only Manager on duty and I spent a lot of the day talking to this one guy, we'll call him Joe. Joe and I often talk a lot on shifts but never really about anything personal, more like latest movies, what we did on the weekend etc. 

At the end of his shift I brought Joe into the office to balance his cash drawer and he waited until we were in there alone and said out of no where ""Do you want to see deliver us from evil""

I didn't think anything of it and responded by saying ""I do want to see it, I like scary movies but none of my friends will ever watch them with me.""

To which he responded ""because I kind of want to see it..."" At that point someone else knocked on the door and we weren't alone in the office anymore so that was it. 

Now he's away on a family trip for the next 2 and a half weeks.

TITLE: I [19 F] am worried that I should break up with my boyfriend [19 M] of 3 years because long distance is causing him to lose confidence and trust in me.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years; we were high school sweethearts and just finished our first year of college long distance. This is my first serious relationship. Our first couple years were great and honeymoon-y. But lately we are constantly arguing primarily because he thinks that I am not as committed to the relationship as he is. 

He tells me that I don't include him when we are together, I lack empathy, and I deliberately make jokes at his expense. He is also worried that I will leave him for a macho guy who is more reserved with his emotions like I am because he knows how much it bothers me when he brings up these flaws of mine. 

I should also mention that through this first year of college he has become depressed and insecure with himself. One night when he was drinking with friends he saw his buddy and buddy's girlfriend get into a fight because the girl said she knew a guy who was more attractive than her boyfriend. My boyfriend then asked me over text if I thought anyone was more attractive that him. I thought he would know I was lying if I said no one, so I told him I did and he demanded that I tell him who. I listed 2 people and he has not been able to trust me the same ever since. His confidence is now squashed beyond repair and he thinks more than ever that I'll leave him for someone better. 

I love him so much and just 2 months ago I could see us getting married and having a future, and that's a major part that makes the idea of ending it so difficult. But the more he accuses me of not being committed, the more I think he is right and feel like I should just end it. I don't want to prove him right that I didn't care about him enough, and I don't want to intensify his depression by bringing his fears to life. but I also don't want to stay in a relationship that is unhealthy and doomed to fail anyway. 

I'm not fishing for affirmations here, feel free to tell me that I'm being a dick. I just have no idea what the right thing to do is. Advice?

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend is insecure and thinks I'll leave him for someone better. Long distance is causing him to lose confidence and trust in me.

At some bars I had cleaned tables outside the bar, and i was just like whatever, if that's how it works over here. Turns out that's not how it worked over there. when she confirmed benches, she meant the kitchen benches. Hind sight is a bitch. at this point she just explained to the other staff that i was just outside the kiosk scrubbing at a random bench.

TITLE: Boyfriend is angry and confrontational. I'm a doormat

POST: My boyfriend (26) is the kind of guy who doesn't put up with crap. He calls out people when they're wrong, yells at bad drivers, and uses the word ""dumbass"" very liberally. I should clarify that it's never excessive, violent, or directed at me. I kind of admire his assertiveness sometimes. A lot of people would probably see this as a reasonable level of emotion, but I have some problems dealing with it.

As I mentioned, I (24) am a doormat. I very, very rarely get angry at anything. My usual response to conflict is to curl up into a ball and cry. I was also physically abused by my father as a kid, because of his anger management issues. When other people are angry, I feel awkward and terrified. I'm working with a therapist to try to get over some of my emotional problems. So far I can successfully deal with anger from/get angry at my sister and my best friend without it being a big deal. With other people, any form of conflict just sits in my mind and scares me.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. He knows all about my issues, accepts them, and is always very kind and collected when we're working out minor problems together. But he still gets very angry at other people, and himself. We have similar interests, and I feel more comfortable talking to him than to anyone else. Our relative anger levels just seem incompatible.

 I've talked to him about how people getting angry scares me, and he's very understanding of that. I know it's not right to want someone in a relationship to change. I know that's part of who he is and I admire it a bit, but I don't really want to have to become agressive to accept it either. Most of all, I'm terrified of either one of us becoming angry with each other. I know it probably has to happen eventually, and I don't want to get scared and end the relationship.

TITLE: How To Move To New Home W/ Puppy?

POST: Hi all,

So, I got a new puppy a bit over a month ago. She's a 13 week chihuahua She's got a great attitude, very friendly, and she's pretty smart. She already knows ""no"", sit, down, shake, ""drop it"", and how to let me know when she needs to go out.

Unfortunately, I am working for the summer (at a pet supply!) and do not have a steady schedule, so I decided not to crate train her. She sleeps with me. She used to wake up a few times at night, but I guess her bladder is more developed and now she wakes up at 6:30 every morning. She knows how to wake me up to take her out. 

Right now, when I'm working, I put her into my bathroom. I keep the light and radio on, put in a puppy pad, water, and a frozen kong among 2 or 3 other regular treats to keep her company. I also keep her crate door open so she can get to everything and doesn't feel trapped.

I'm a college student and will be living in an apartment with three other women, one being a friend. I just want to make this move as painless as possible for both of us. I want to know how to make sure she isn't whining while I'm in class (which will be a lot less time than when I was working), so that we don't get complaints and I have to get rid of her. I still would rather not crate train as she's pretty used to her routine sleep with me, but can anyone give advice on this??? I don't think she whines in the bathroom while I'm at work, but my only evidence is that when I come home, she's completely quiet and when I open the bathroom door, she comes running out her crate. 

Also, I'm sharing a bathroom so I will probably not be able to do it in my bathroom, but start leaving her in a portion of my bedroom. She was accidentally left in my bedroom once while I was away and she didn't really destroy anything so that's hopeful.

TL;DR:",  I'm moving to an apartment with other college students and want to make sure my 13 week chihuahua doesn't whine while I'm at work.

But at first she would throw these fits about lying whenever she'd find out I made up a little something (like quitting cigarette smoke). She would also talk to a lot of guys, and I mean a lot. And wouldn't let me have any girlfriends. I was no pushover though, I was just really lenient and didn't mind her going out partying much, and also never made a huge fuss when she would cheat. I would just talk us through it. Anyway, we broke up the last three months we lived together because of a number of problems and I may have told her to drop dead, I don't know.

TITLE: Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution?

POST: When the internet began to pick up speed in the days of the 56k modem, I remember fearful talks about how this new technological tool would revolutionize the contemporary era. 

Outside of highly accessible porn, mass mp3 theft, and the rise of troll culture I don't really feel that the internet has lived up to its expectations. 

I look at the recent financial crisis, the BP oil spill, and the state of the US energy infrastructure at large and I can't help but wonder if the internet will one day provide us will an effective tool to apply collective social pressure to stop these travesties. It feels like a far off utopian ideal. 

Yet I see places like reddit full of people that at least seem like they care. 

In theory the internet is the ultimate tool for social connection and information exchange. This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. 

This then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).

The ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). 

However I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. 

Hence I ask, ""Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution?""

When I ask this I do not want the opinion of ""people"" or ""society at large"". I am wondering how you personally feel about taking on such an endeavor.

TL;DR:",  Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution? How would you go about doing so and what are your personal thoughts on the matter?,"  Would you be willing to put in effort to make the internet a stronger tool for social/political change?

TITLE: Boyfriend [25M] gets upset when I [21F] don't spend enough time with him when I see him

POST: Together for 6 months.  We both live with our parents.

I come over to his place every weekend. My parents are conservative and wouldn't allow me to bring a guy over.  We usually spend the night grabbing or making dinner, watch Netflix, then have sex.

Sometimes, however, his sister will be around and I'll chat up with her for a bit.  Meanwhile, bf waits impatiently on his phone looking upset.

Other times, I might get caught up talking with his family.  Or I'd have to do homework.

I'd ask him about it, and he'll say he wanted to spend his weekend hanging out with me instead of waiting on me.  I'd tell him if he can make other plans, he should.  I don't want to get in the way with him spending time with his friends.

Still, he'd say he'd rather spend time with me.

I like him, but I feel like he's starting to get clingy.  We already see each other every day as we have classes together.  I'm thinking of spending less time with him and not coming over as often.

TITLE: How to get over the fact I [m/22] think I'm going to lose my best friends [m/22] and [f/21]

POST: So basically my two best friends are a couple. I however knew the guy a year before the girl. Eventually the girl found her way into our group of friends and became close with all of us for about a year before she started dating the guy. 2 years later they're still dating and the group fell apart for the most part except for us 3.

They really are great people and never make me feel like a third wheel (probably because I was friends with both prior to dating) and over the last 5 months we got real close I feel. They both helped with with a huge medical scare (I suffer from Crohns) with the female friend always being there to talk and even go with me to the hospital. I have also helped them both out and I know they have told me things that I doubt anyone else knows. We are all very open.

The problem is they will be moving back away for school 40 mins away. And this upsets me greatly. Since April we have all hung out probably 2-3 times a week every week and even went on vacation together with a few other friends. I feel like the shift now to seeing eachother maybe once a month is going to kill our relationship. I'm worried maybe I'll be replaced by their new roommates or something. That we will slowly drift apart.

I've expressed this concern of wanting to stay in touch and how i'm worried it wont be like that. They have both said they will prove me wrong.

Any ideas how I can get over this?

TITLE: My husband's nephew has aspergers, his parents won't get him diagnosed or get him help. What to do?

POST: The kid is 18 years old, about to graduate high school and is going to a decent university in the fall. He's really smart but utterly socially inept. The boy has aspergers, everyone knows it, but he is not professionally diagnosed. The parents think if the son knows he's aspie, he'll feel stigmatized or it will ruin his college/goals if he knows. The kid has never had friends, has problems with girl obsessions & not taking cues that girls think he's odd/aren't interested and is starting to look like a stalker. I'm afraid he'll not understand his actions and do something not socially acceptable. 

I think knowing would help him tremendously. He could understand why everyone is repelled by him, learn some life skills and possibly have a shot at a more normal future. I'm afraid he'll get to college and get so wrapped up in social issues, figuring out how to dress/feed himself, etc. he'll end up depressed, overwhelmed and ultimately fail.

POST: We've been together over two years, I am a 20M in my third year of college, she's a 19F in her first year. She has been saying that I am distancing myself because of my job (I am an RA at my college, and she goes to a different college). While that may be true, I have a job to do, and I can't spend my time worrying about myself and taking on her tribulations (she's having a hard time making friends at school and uses me as a ""safe harbor"" to avoid her school and potentially new friends, which is a problem considering if I cut her off, she will have nearly no social life). I think if we both take some time for ourselves (a year or two), then we can get rid of all of this stress, and if it's meant to be then we'll get back together.

TITLE: Ex (42M) of 2.5 yrs broke ""no contact rule"" and made me (27F) a financial offer he knows I can't refuse

POST: A bit over a week ago my ex and I broke up. He is very business savy and wealthy. 

We had lived together for a full 3 weeks, but being with a traveling business man is not easy, and he felt pressured into commitment. He being 42 told me I was not right to be his future wife, so he kicked me out. I am in my late 20s and very much in love with him. 

He is cold but showed his love in the form of helping my company get off the ground. He invested time and money getting things set up for me. Suddenly he wants me gone but still hopes to participate in my business ventures. I begin no contact and he is shocked. I admit I stalked his facebook, he was depressed up until yesterday. Today I launched my online store and made a Tinder account (I found him there a week ago). Today he emails me a very business-like email saying how it's stupid talking through assistants when he could just contact me about my business plan. He offers all the financial and business help he knows I need. 

A part of me knows it's because he wants in on my future business (it's fucking genius) a part of me hopes it's because he hates waking up alone and being completely alone. He was incredibly depressed the last few weeks we were together. I was worried and asked him to get psych help. Now he's throwing money at the situation, asking for nothing in return. He knew I needed a couple of thousand for a lawyer, a bit more for merchandise, etc. He writes a detailed pricing email explaining me my business model but says he wants nothing more than my success and maybe a bit of his initial investment. 

I'm lost without him both emotionally and business-wise but somehow could make it work without him(loan from family), although not as well as he ever could, not a marketer at all. He knows this. Right now there is nothing tying me to him, except my feelings and need for business help. What to do?

TITLE: Boyfriend[23/M] group-hanging out with party girl [23/F]... Reasonable to be bothered or not? [5 year relationship]

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. Everything is 90% good. 

He hangs out with his 4 male friends on a regular basis to play a game that I don't like playing, so I never come. At times, those males bring their girlfriends or just female friends along, and it's always been fine with me.

Now, however, a girl [23/f] ""Trisha"" is interested in becoming a regular part of their hangouts. The hangouts would be 4 guys (including my boyfriend) and now her. I barely know her, but from what I've seen of her on Facebook, she (based on the pictures):

1. drinks a lot and flaunts it

2. has stripped to her bra and underwear before with my boyfriend's friends

3. grabs her boobs (through clothes) and holds them up for camera at a party environment 

4. stands on table while doing similar obnoxious behavior

Soo... I don't think my boyfriend would cheat on me, but it makes me uncomfortable to imagine her becoming a regular part of their group. I also feel like it's almost disrespectful for him to be around someone like that on a regular basis. I've told him that it makes me uncomfortable, but he (he has had more social interaction with her than I have, but still pretty limited) says that those pictures are just pictures and don't represent who she really is. And that she is ""just one of the guys"" and not to worry about it.

But here I am, worrying and writing about it on Reddit. Is it unreasonable for me to be bothered by this girl becoming a regular part of their hangouts? And how wrong would it be for me to request that my boyfriend does not hang out with her, or significantly limits it, rather than having regular hangouts with her involved?

POST: I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little bit over 1 year. We recently had a breakup because I was distant and she thought I was cheating on her (which I wasn't). Before the breakup, she wanted to spend as much time with me as she could, but recently she has been very distant. We used to go to eachothers places overnight almost daily, but nowadays she does not want to come over to my place or want me to go over to hers (We both live on our own). She also used to talk to me all the time on facebook, but now she pretty much only replies to what I talk, and does not try to keep the conversation going. She has became pretty slow at replying, but when I'm with her, she replies instantly to her other friends who text her. 

I'm really lost at this situation, because I feel like she does not want to be with me anymore. I know that she's taking SSRI medications at the moment for anxiety. But she was taking them before we broke up for couple weeks. Her explanation for this situation is that she wants to spend some time alone, because she is working so much and never has time to be alone. This bothers me because she used to want to be with me all the time she could, and now she does not even try to schedule time for me.

POST: I'm a 25 female, dating a 23 male.  We live in the eastern United States, I'm attending grad school, he's attending law school.  We've been dating for 3 months now and have been exclusive for the past month and a half or so.  At this point we don't call each other boyfriend or girlfriend, but he does stay over every couple weeks and I've stayed over his place on multiple occasions.  He's very affectionate in person and in his text messages, he opens car doors for me, we hold hands in public, kiss etc.  I have only met one of his friends, but he's shown my picture to a couple of his gfs.

Anyways to get to the question.  He was asking me what I was doing and I told him I was listening to my friend tell me how she was FB stalking our high school classmates who had hot boyfriends.  And he said ""so she's stalking you? haha jk"" I said ""to answer you, yes :)"" and then ""does that mean you're claiming the boyfriend title haha?""

He completely ignored that boyfriend text and moved on with the conversation.  I haven't brought it up again, and don't plan to anytime soon.

TITLE: Reddit, how can my brass choir raise money to travel to Albania and help grow their music education?

POST: As the title says, I need help coming up with ideas/resources on how to raise enough money for a twenty-student brass band to travel to Albania/Greece. The trip is going to cost about $3,000 a piece, and most of us poor students just don't have the cash for that. Any info on corporate donations or huge fundraising ideas would be great. 

Back Story: Last year, one of the trumpet teachers (who is a good friend of my trumpet professor) came to my school in order to study with professors in America and expand his knowledge. He teaches at the only conservatory in Albania, The Albanian University of Arts. Even though he is a great player, there are so many things that he just doesn't have access to. This includes all the different teaching methods and equipment. For instance, he was in an opera over there, but the trumpet he had when he came here would have been considered a ""beginner's"" model here in the states. He was fortunately able to purchase a new one with the grant he received. He is also now the first person in Albania to own a piccolo trumpet, which is a standard thing for performers here. I can't explain how cool this is!! 

Now that he is back in Albania, he is begging our brass choir to go over and visit. Doing this would propel their brass program forward, as they don't have access to the quality of players that we have. It would also give the students over there a chance to interact with American students, which would be very beneficial to them (as well as us).

In addition to working with the school, we plan on giving concerts at the embassies as well as around Albania/Greece.

TL;DR:",  Need help coming up with ideas/resources to raise money for a 20 student brass band to travel to Albania and help grow their music education.,  I need to know how I can raise money so our university Brass Choir can go to Albania in order help improve the education of their brass musicians.

I will start out with the background info.
I recently got out of a long relationship and the reason it fell apart basiclly was that there was a rumor that said I hooked up with one of my closest friends which is a girl lets call her Emma. This never happend, both Emma and I  got a lot of shit because of it in both our reletionships. My relationship failed when my GF was deadset that this rumor was the truth and cheated on me because of it as a sort of payback. I can not deny that there is a attraction between Emma and me, but we have never acted on it. Emma just got out her relationship aswell because she got tired of her BF being a douche about this rumor. 

The problem
Emma and I always sort of hanged out with other friends when we both had a partner. But I got a text from Emma tonight asking if we should hang out just the two of us tomorrow night playing video games, watching movies and drink some. This will propbably lead to us hooking up and I would not be far out by saying it will probably lead to sex aswell. I would also not be far out by saying this will lead us to becoming fuck friends aswell. While I can honstley say that I have fantasized about having sex with her, now that the opportunity has presented itself I'm not sure what to do. 
One part of me wants to have sex with her and see how it is since it ruined my relationship and I wouldn't mind having her as a fuck friend(she is smoking hot). But another part of me wonders if this will make it akward to stay friends, I really treasure her as one of my best friends and I really don't want to lose her as my friend because of this. 

And that is my problem Reddit, what do you guys think I should do?

POST: Ok, so in the grand scheme of things this may seem like a rather insignificant little problem, but its the most troubling thing for me in my life at the moment apart from my studies. 
So I'm in high school, 11th grade, a sophomore basically (not sure if sophomore or senior, Aussie here) and I have a girlfriend. Yeah, I know, how silly of me. The thing is, I really like this girl, but she seems to be way more into this relationship than I am. I am considering breaking up with her but then it would be so awkward for both of us as we are in the same class together for Biology and do our experiments and what-not together. She is also very emotionally unstable at this point, very conscious of her weight, has been known to cut herself and doesnt have a very good relationship with her parents. Anybody who is or has been in a similar situation please, you're my only hope.

TITLE: Me[23M] after breaking up with my girlfriend [25F] of half a year had realization, are relationships a mix of 'freedom vs security' or 'freedom vs responsibility'?

POST: I've been having a relationship with a girl for nearly half a year and we recently decided to break it off. After not being in a relationship much since high school, and having many casual hookups, I rushed into a relationship after a life changing event. I was surprised and shocked as I discovered how similar we were, but didn't really know what I wanted in a relationship. I guess after being single for so long, you realize you have a great deal of freedom. Freedom to do whatever you want without any real repercussions other than your own guilt. But when you're in a relationship, you trade that freedom to do anything with the security of having another person to confide in, to hold against the darkness of the universe. I guess I felt like I was losing my identity as I precipitated from a 'me' mentality to a 'we' mentality. Perhaps the 'me' mentality is a symptom of being a young adult, and at some point you realize that security is more important as you age and experience the world, but you have to want to make the transition. I feel like I lost her because I wasn't able to meet my responsibilities for the 'we' part, and I wasn't always there when she needed me. 

I guess my question is two parts. How do you reconcile the loss of your self identity to meet it in the middle with your mutual other? 

Then also, is the 'freedom vs security' a valid way to look at modern day relationships? It's really 1 person vs 2 people, which is the stronger model? Also, is security interchangeable with responsibility because you have to be responsible in order to gain the benefits of security? This kind of matches the constant struggle in the political spectrum where we try to pick a perfect balance between freedom (doing whatever you want) vs security (being safer) or responsibility (standing up for what you think is right despite what may feel good).  I mean, are there any abstract examples or ideas out there that very closely match the balance of a good relationship?

TITLE: TIFU by telling my pregnant wife I wouldn't cheat on her.

POST: This basically happened... oh... ten minutes ago or so.

My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and well into the morning sickness, sick headaches, hormonal/emotional mess that the first trimester brings. Her self-esteem has taken a hit and her nerves are pretty frayed because she basically feels like ass 24/7. Her nausea usually hits her the worst in the afternoons and evenings, so today after work, she decided to lay down in bed and read until I got home from work about an hour later. When I got home, I crawled into bed with her and we started cuddling and chatting about our days.

Now, sexy time usually happens in the evenings or before we go to bed, but the last month or so, my wife has felt so crappy in the evenings that she usually just passes the fuck out as soon as she hits the pillow. Being the understanding husband I am, I of course let sleeping pregnant ladies lie and let her get her much needed rest. Growing a person is hard work apparently! She has expressed regret, though, that we haven't had sex in awhile and today was no different. As we were cuddling in bed, she apologized again that we haven't had sex in awhile and said she wished she was feeling better so she could, and she said this in a joking tone, ""attend to her wifely duties."" 

I kissed her on the cheek and, in the same joking tone, said, ""Don't worry. I won't cheat on you.""

She looked at me with complete horror and kind of choked out, ""Wh-why would you even say that? Are you? Omigod, are you cheating on me?"" Cue the crying and sobbing and blubbering. She kept repeating, ""I wouldn't blame you. I'm gross and fat and ugly. I haven't felt good enough for sex. I would understand. I wouldn't blame you.""

I of course started apologizing profusely. I have never apologized so much in my life. She finally just said, ""Okay. Okay,"" a few times and quit crying. But she asked to be alone for a while. 

Reddit. I fucked up.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] of 14 months. I can't figure out a solid reason why I should stay in (or break up) this relationship!

POST: My girlfriend is kind, loving, sweet, really hot etc and tells me she loves me all the time, but I can't shake the feeling that she's not the one. I know I'm young and so is she, and being my first girlfriend this is probably a pretty generic case. I don't know why I feel this way which is why the prospect of breaking up is so hard, I'd want to give her a reason other than ""I just don't feel the same""!

One thing that does bug me is the fact that she says she loves me SO much, like, at least 2-3 times an hour when we're together. I feel like she doesn't trust that I'll say it back? I also feel sometimes that she wants to keep me for the company, as she doesn't have many friends (she wouldn't have any trouble getting any if she put herself out there a bit more) of her own and is often alone in her flat. I, on the other hand have no problems being by myself for a length of time. 

Oh, and I'm moving to Sydney for 5 months in 8 weeks or so.

I feel like I'm answering some of my own questions simply by typing my thoughts out here, but I'd much appreciate other people's opinions.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend is really sweet and loving but I can't shake the feeling that she's not the one. I love her but the prospect of breaking up is very hard to justify.

TITLE: I'm confused and I feel violated, help?

POST: A bit of background: I (f) am in a long term relationship with some I love more than I ever thought I could. I've recently had to change up my friend groups as well for various reasons. Anyway, I went to the pub with a few new friends last night and we all got very drunk and had a good time. We went back to a friends house where I ended up falling asleep. The problem: I went to bed alone (he has a spare bedroom which he let me use because I lived half an hour away from him) but in the middle of the night I woke up being in between two of my male friends. We were fully clothed so I just assumed they would rather share a bed than just sleep on the floor, which didn't bother me, but the friend behind me was touching me in very private places (he didn't go under clothing though). I could hear him whispering things to himself and it was very obvious he was horny. I felt very uncomfortable about this and panicked so I pretended that I was still sleeping. This probably lasted for about an hour and even if I moved to try and get him off of me he would just pull me back.
What I'm asking now is, what do I do? I didn't confront him about it this morning and I also haven't told my partner. I also feel like if i say anything i am going to cause a rift in the friend group which i really don't want to do.

TITLE: Help; My uncle has been missing abroad for 20 years. How could I look for him?

POST: Hello, Reddit.

Here goes… My dad's brother left Europe to work in Australia in 1978, long before I was born. During the time he was in his early 20's. My dad and the rest of the brothers escorted him to the airport, watched him take off and never heard from him again…

Later on my relatives have tried to search for him in different ways – through Australian authorities, other relatives living in Australia, Red Cross, etc. without success. We know he got to Australia. We know he had a job waiting there. Other than that, the authorities at least won't tell anything. All we're left are the immigration selection documents and a bunch of photos taken at the airport.

I gather there are two possible scenarios; a) he somehow died and went missing or b) he went missing willingly and had kept under the radar. Nobody knows why he would've done such a thing, though. Others think the authorities would've told had he died. It's been a long time since and we understand there's good change he's passed away but many of us still stay positive. The 70's were a lot different time and you probably could've disappeared if you wanted to.

Now, I know the internet is a powerful tool and at this point, I turn to you and your advice. How would one use the internet to look for him? I don't think creating a Facebook page would do squat but I don't really know where to look from… Please help.

TITLE: I'm [26 F] seeing a guy [28M] who's treated me better than anyone I've ever dated, but he just wants something casual in spite of if feeling v serious. Do I let him go?

POST: I met this lovely guy on tinder (I know, questionable origins) and he's treated me better than anyone I've ever been with. From our very first date he said he was only in the market for casual however, so I've been understandably weary. But regardless of our casual status, we see each other weekly, have Scrabble nights, pig out and watch Netflix... Plus he invited me to his brother's wedding and asked me to go away for the weekend with him, among other very coupley things. Plus he's just so nice to me, always telling me I'm pretty, plus he seems to find my daftness charming (I'm not used to this).

Anyway, in spite of it all, he doesn't want to commit, and he's still on tinder. Apparently he used to be pretty overweight and has had really long dry spells, so he says he wants to make up for lost time. We've only been dating 2 months, but I can feel myself becoming attached. I don't want to let him go though, because he gives me everything I need (beside the title of girlfriend) and I'm scared I won't find another guy as nice as him. I've been with quite a few dudes, and at this point in the relationship they usually fade on me or start to treat me like shit. 

I'm just not sure if I should let him go because we want different things at the moment, or if I should stick it out for a little while longer and see if he changes his mind, since it genuinely feels as if he really likes me. Any advice/anecdotes would be greatly welcomed :)

TITLE: Reddit, what's the scariest interaction you've had with a stranger? I was chased through the desert..

POST: In January 2007, my wife (then girlfriend), best friend and I drove 2,000 miles to attend a playoff game in San Diego. Along the California border, I had the bright idea to take a side road between Interstate 10 and Interstate 8 to save time. It was about 3 in the morning and there were no cars within miles on either side of me when all of a sudden I see a car come speeding up with its left turn light blinking. I slowed down to let it pass but instead the driver started creeping up to my bumper and refusing to pass. No big deal, waited for a passable zone and slowed down to allow him to pass. By now, I'm going about 25 in a 60 and he is still riding my bumper. Freaked out a little bit, I sped up to 85, he's still on my ass. We're hauling ass through the Imperial Sand Dunes Rec area when all of a sudden another car comes up with its emergency lights flashing. The car that had initially followed me now started trying to box me in on the left side and run me off the road. I kept swerving back and forth to make it really difficult.
As I neared the town of Brawley, I decided I had to make a move. I slammed the brakes with both cars right on me, they swerved and stopped about 50 feet in front of me, just sitting there. I sat in the middle of the road facing either direction while they watched us for about 10 minutes. Finally they started to pull off, unfortunately I still had to go in that direction so I floored it to about 100 to avoid an ambush. The adrenaline rush got us all the way to San Diego in the wee morning hours. I was scared shitless, there are other stories but this is the one that takes the cake.

TITLE: Housemate leaves used tampons in toilet and is a nasty b*tch - please help?

POST: this is a throw away account because my house mate is pretty cray cray.  We are both 26/f

A little while ago I found a used tampon in our toilet bowl and confronted my housemate about it [(see first post)]  

After the wonderful words of redditors I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt - maybe it a was mistake - even though in my other confrontations with her she's been a total nasty b*tch - so I had a feeling this was done out of spite but I didnt say anything.

Today I woke up to find yet another used, bloody, nasty tampon in our bowl.  Flipping gross.  I texted her ""I need you to flush your tampons if you are going to put them in the toilet bowl"" (we have been having drain issues because she is flushing her nasty tampons and she refuses to stop).  

She replied, ""Oh I must have not pushed the handle down hard enough"" - the lid was up when I walked into the bathroom so I'm not buying that bogus line.

I wrote back, ""Thanks in advance for making sure that does not happen again.""  to drive home the point that I'm serious.

Came home today and she 1.  didn't apologize for subjecting me to her nastyness and 2. refuses to talk to me and is blasting her music (ie sending the non verbal message I'm pissed).  I dont really care about our friendship that much (anyone who doesnt own up to leaving their used sanitary napkins in the toilet of a shared bathroom isn't a person I need to have a long term friendship with) but I do care about my standard of living.

heres my question:
1 - Can I somehow make this gross behavior stop so I don't have to see her used tampons anymore?
2 - if she retaliates (which I have a feeling she will...she's pretty passive aggressive) with something worse - how do I protect myself?  What if she starts leaving her poo in the bowl or leaving something else gross around the house?

POST: I [25F] met my friend [30F] last year, and quickly realized that her relationship that I assumed was healthy (we have mutual friends) is really codependent and toxic. She acknowledges that she's a shell of her former self, he verbally abuses her, manipulates her in weird/unhealhthy ways, and has isolated her from all of her friends. A few of our mutual friends think it is abusive.

I was really happy to be friends with her, until her drunken boyfriend lashed out at me for no reason. He randomly started telling me I was a worthless person. I'm sure he was just jealous she had a friend. I managed to be patient with the scenario since I wanted her to have support, but eventually I was too blunt about my disapproval which upset her, and our relationship kind of faded out.

I'm not sure what to do. I valued her as a friend, and at the least would like to be supportive. But I think her boyfriend is an abusive asshole.

My girlfriend and I have been together since we were in school. In fact we're celebrating our 14th anniversary this year, and we couldn't be happier with each other.  We're just as in love now as we were when we first got together.

The problem is that everything in those 14 years has been a complete secret from everyone we know.
When we first got together I told me mother I was bisexual and she hit the roof.  In all other respects she's an amazing parent and I love her very much, but she absolutely forbid me to do this.  So, we kept our relationship a secret, neither of us really expecting it to last forever.

When I left school I suffered a medical issue that has left me disabled and stranded at home with my mother (who has cared for me amazingly). I'm without the means to get a job or support myself properly.  Because my mum is a generally cool lady she allowed my girlfriend to move in with us a few years ago, but as a friend - nothing more.  Our relationship was, and is still a secret.

My girlfriend has a low income job that couldn't possibly support us if we moved out, and my mother is still as adamant as ever that homosexuality is wrong.  As we're soon to be entering our thirties together, my girlfriend and I would love to get married, and rent a place of our own, but if I just straight out tell my mother she'll blow her top and kick her out and we wouldn't get to be together at all, any more.

Neither of us know anyone that would put us up, and we both rely on my mother a lot for anything from advice to health care, but at this rate it just feels like we're going in circles and getting nowhere.  Please, help, Reddit. Is there any way out of this mess that we're missing?

4 months ago my partner of 5.5 years left me to pursue a relationship with a girl from work. As I know, he didn't *actually* cheat on me, however in my heart it feels the same--if not worse because he actually PURSUED a relationship, not just sex. He said he regretted it pretty early on but they continued to be together for two months, and not once did he try to contact me to work things out. 

It was short lived, apparently, and he's back saying he fucked up and he realized his mistakes and ""realized"" that what we have is a once in a lifetime sort of thing. I'm hesitant. I feel so hurt and betrayed, and I feel very disillusioned about our relationship in general. I love him and I am still so very much in love with him, but I just don't really feel as though he won't ever experience grass is greener syndrome again. But then again, we are still young and immature with how we handle things so maybe he did really learn?

So what I'm really asking is to hear about others' experiences with a situation such as this. Is it worth giving him a second chance?

TITLE: Divorced parents issues :(

POST: Briefly, my parents split up about 6 years ago, and to say it was an unfriendly divorce is putting it extremely mildly. My dad remarried about three years ago. My mom has not and is quite happy being single. The only people IRL who know my SO and I are engaged are my mom and my sister (this is only until the ring is finished in the spring-ish).

Now that my fiance and I are discussing more details of the wedding (like venue, kind of wedding, photography, etc), I've realized that this is probably going to be a big issue.

In the past my mom has said things like 'I don't want to go if your father is bringing her' (which I told her was unreasonable), 'I don't want her in any family pictures, she had nothing to do with raising you' (understandable but still perhaps irrational), etc. And it occurred to me that figuring out seating is going to be problematic.

I'm not even sure how people are traditionally seated at weddings but I thought that the  in-laws sat at the same table? I don't think this will be able to happen, and I'd feel like a huge jerk seating my dad and his wife at another table while my mom and my fiance's family sat at the same table. And equally I can't cut my mom out and have my dad sit with my future in-laws, she would be really upset.

What do, weddit?

TITLE: Sorry, not sorry.

POST: So I've just moved to a new area from Montana. While I've read tumblr/4chan dumps and whatnot, I really never thought this would happen to me.

So i go to a Wendy's after work for some fries and a frosty to have with me when I go Folfing right after. Long line through the drive through, so i go in. As I approach the door a younger woman is coming in behind me.
Now, my reaction to ANYONE coming in a door behind me is to open/hold the door open for me. 

Well fuck you too FEMALE. Holy shit guys. I didnt know real people would get ""triggered"" by a common and nice gesture... i mean damn, i woulda held the door open for anyone, but i guess holding the door open for some ""dog kin pentasexual"" person is, 
A. A rape.(hily shit what?)
B. Supporting a patriarchy  (wtf?)
C. I said ""sorry maam"" which is a normal responce to doing something a woman (or something that portrays a female externally. ... i guess) doesnt like.

TL;DR:","  While waiting in a drive thru, a female comes in behind me and i hold the door open for her. Probably a rape.",  its now a crime to open doors for people and I retract my apology nor will I be sorry for doing a kind act. Fuck that.

TITLE: [CA] Can I have a car that is parked in the red towed?

POST: I live in an apartment complex with a gated parking lot that has its only exit onto a very busy street. The drive way that lets out of the parking lot and onto the street is flanked on each side by a red no parking zone about 2-3 car lengths long so that cars pulling out can have a clear line of site of the oncoming traffic. A few of the apartments face onto the street and legal street parking can be hard to come by. Some of my neighbors consistently park in the redzone adjacent to the parking lot's only exit, which makes it hard to see oncoming traffic. More than a few times I have almost been t-boned by oncoming traffic since my view is obstructed and I either cannot see the cars with enough time, or I have to pull out farther to see around the illegally parked car. I can't imagine that I am the only person in our complex who has had this problem. I am currently writing a note to put on the cars that park there to ask them to please park elsewhere or a tow truck will be called.

My question is, am I allowed to call a private towing company to tow the car away or do I have to contact police? I would hate to waste police resources with something so trivial.

TL;DR:","  Some of my neighbors illegally park in the red zone next to the parking lot's only exit, making it hard to see oncoming traffic. Can I have a private tow truck come and remove the car?",  What can I do to get rid of a car illegally parked in the red zone that is obstructing the view of people trying to leave a parking lot?

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my Girlfriend [22 F] of 4 years, scared to leave

POST: All right, I'm sure by the title it sounds like I'm being physically abused. And while there is emotional abuse at play here, that's not what's up.

We've been together since our senior year in high school, four years now. The entirety of her college career. But I don't feel the same way about her that I used to. I love her still, I really do. But I don't see us together in my picture of the future. I want to go out and do things on my own for the first time. I've never lived by myself, and I need to do that.

We moved in last June. Things were okay for a while, but it's just gone downhill.

I know it's not fair for me to keep this going when I clearly am no longer invested in the relationship, but it hurts to think about being without her in my life. It hurts to think about the pain it's going to cause her. And mostly, I'm fucking terrified of being on my own after breaking up.

We moved to a city where I don't have any friends, and all of my friends and family are two hours away. I don't have anyone I can go to in person.

I'm scared I'll never find anyone else. I'm scared of being alone after four years, and not having that person I can go to with anything. I'm scared of waking up each day alone in bed. It just makes me so fucking sad to think about.

So I was wondering if there was anyone here I could talk to who's gone through something like this? I really need help. This is tearing me apart inside. I'm having anxiety attacks almost daily, and she doesn't know a thing.

Help. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:",  Been with my girlfriend for 4 years. Love her but don't see us together anymore. Scared of being on my own after break up. Need help.,"  I need to get out of my 4 year relationship with the person I love, but I'm scared of what the future holds."

TITLE: Talking and being with my girlfriend [19F] feels completely vapid and almost like I'm [17M] interacting with a machine, however it gets a bit more complex. What do?

POST: Right, so I've been with this girl for a bit over two months now; she's attractive, we share the same general interests and I should be loving her to pieces. The catch? I'm not, honestly this whole thing feels completely vapid, every time we kiss or even just talk I don't feel like I'm getting any satisfaction, and that I may as well be talking to an inanimate object. Her replies to things are rarely longer than a few words, and even sex felt rather dull when we got round to it.

So yeah, I took heed of this and decided to tell her that it wasn't working, she cried a bit, and we generally left on good terms, it all felt pretty decent. Then I did a really piss-poor thing and decided to get back with her. Why? Because I felt bad, and I won't deny that this whole thing is anybody else's fuck up than mine.

Now to the actual question: What do? Going in and simply breaking up with her again would look ridiculous, and would most certainly put us on bad terms with each other for the foreseeable future, considering that we have a few close mutual friends, that would also cause complications. I need some advice here, if any can be given.

TL;DR:","  Been with girlfriend for a bit over two months, things feel completely vapid, decided to tell her that it's not working, now regretting it, what do?","  In relationship, feels empty, broke up once then guilted into getting back with her, still feels empty. Help."

TITLE: My [20 M] girlfriend's [19 F] ex won't stop leaving her alone.

POST: Hi first post here and english is not my native language so don't kill me if I have bad grammar.

She has been telling me that her ex keeps telling every one to that he regrets cheating on her which he did a lot and to take him back. 
He does not only do this by talking to her, but also by talking to her family and friends and basically make her look bad for not accepting him back because he is a sweetheart in front of them.
She knows better and told me that he has always been manipulative like that. 

He took it so far that he told his mom to arrange a meeting with her (basically them and their moms are going to meet and the moms are going to leave them alone). She already told him that she is seeing me.

Honestly I have mixed feelings about this but I trust her and she told me that she is sick of seeing his face and wants him to stop bothering her. He is probably going to be sweet to her that day.

As I am far away from her right now, I don't know what to do. I can't be there to accompany her if anything happens and I'm honestly sick of him trying to manipulate people around her to make her forgive him for cheating and take him back. My gf and I agrees that he is a scumbag.

TL;DR:",  Girlfriends ex manipulative ex constantly tries to manipulate her and make her forgive him for cheating and take him back. She knows better and wants him to stop bothering her. What should I do?,  Gf's ex is trying to get her back in a really manipulative way and I can't be there when they meet

TITLE: So, my new Girlfriend is 2 months pregnant. I'm lost and confused!

POST: Hey Reddit!

I'm really lost and confused here. Me (M) and She both early 20s. 

I've been dating this girl for about 4 weeks, 'speaking to' for about 8. Today she tells me that she is Pregnant, from a fling, considered an abortion, but decided that's not for her, and she will become a parent by the end of the year. (She discussed this with me shortly after she found out herself).

I don't know how to handle it, or how I'm supposed to fit into this life of hers. Obviously it means massive massive life changes in a few months time, and a massive shift in priorities either which way. 

But at the moment I'm so confused at to what this means for me too. Last we spoke, I needed time to think, but I need a bit of advice from others external to the situation who  can see things 'fresh'.

My thought process at the moment looks like this?

* I'm not sure if I want kids

* How do I date someone who is Pregnant / New Mother (especially when the child is someone elses)

* How would I handle this if this was my own baby?

* What does she need from me in terms of support?

* Would it be unreasonable to 'break up' and 'cut my losses' as it were? 

Et Cetera, et cetera... 

So, I'm struggling with the whole ""thinking"" part. I know at some point we need to sit down and talk together, that is a given. But as it stands now I don't know how to organise my thoughts in a sensible and coherent manner. Any advice?

TL;DR:","  New Girlfriend is pregnant from a fling, considering becoming a parent. Confused about what this means for me and how to best handle it.","  My new partner is pregnant, and has been for the duration of the time we have dated. I'm not sure what to think. Advice welcome!"

TITLE: I [16F] was dumped by my boyfriend [16M] after a year of perfection and now I'm lost

POST: When we met last year we knew of each other but we had never talked but because of a group project we were forced to talked and we instantly started flirting and we knew we had something special. After awhile we started sating and we were each other's first real relationship so we took everything slow. 

As we dated we liked each other more and more but as teenagers we both agreed that we didn't understand real love and we knew we would not last through high school but we made each other happy so we were together. We got serious about 5 months in our relationship and truly knew that we loved each other. We thought that this was the ideal relationship and we even thought we could last. 

We had our problems alone the way like jealously and being too clingy but we got over them. In December he started to change and became more like a teenage boy and stopped being romantic and emotional to the point where he got annoyed if I told him I loved him. He became mean and distant and I did everything I could to keep us together because I still loved him.

He only got worse from there and said he did not love me anymore but loved me for what we used to have. He broke up with me a month ago and ever since then I cry everyday because I miss him and us. He said he wanted to be friends but he's still really mean to me and today I told him off and now I feel empty and don't know what to do.

The lady goes on to say that she believes in reincarnation and believes that my friends soul and her soul are connected and she goes on to tell my friend that she forgives her for anything she has ever done that might hurt her and then asks my friends forgiveness.

TITLE: I [27 f] cant handle this, I am completely alone in this, I thought I could, but I can't. I need advice.

POST: Some clarification first; 

My hobby is being a makeup artist and now I am doing a friend [26,m] (Lets call him Andy) a favour to help him with his new movie. 

My health is ridiculous and it keeps me from doing daily activities. I have IBS, Stomach issues, Migraines, Stress and above all Borderline and no good stamina/condition like normal people. 

Now I am helping with my SO [24,M] and a large film group working on this movie. This is my first day and I already had to wake up at 7 and the director (Andy)  doesn't communicate at all with me about what I can expect to do. I had to sit on the train back and forth per half hour, from 8 am to 3 o clock. Now normally ofcourse I can handle sitting in a train, but I get motion sickness really fast, specially when not focussing on looking out the window. I had to change makeup after every take while sitting in the train. I fet so bad, nearly threw up. I just went and sat in a chair until the actrice came up to me and asked me if I was alright. My SO was not present, but Andy was. He didn't even ask me if I was alright, nothing. Only her and another crew member helped me by getting me water and an apple. Now I still feel sick, and tired. Since I also had to assist with the lightning. Honestly, I already feel exhausted. 

I am supposed to stay for 4 days. Today we aren't finished until 11. Tomorrow we start from 10 am til 4 in the night.

I am on the verge of crying. I feel really dissapointed with my friend. And I don't want to stand in my SO his way, since he is incredibly busy and also happy with it. 

I am scared to say anything, I want to fight this and continue, but I am afraid that I overestimated myself and collapse in front of all these people. I already get comments like you look tired.

TL;DR:","  Helping a friend with his movie, health issues, fatigue and IBS. Already exhausted and feel sick. Don't want to stand in SO's way. Scared to say anything.

TITLE: TIFU by designing an educational brochure

POST: Obligatory ""didn't happen today""...

About 2 years back or so I was in charge of a big portion of marketing at one of my previous companies and was the only graphic designer. We had just recently kickstarted a community outreach and educational program for parents and their children.

Well, there were community/educational brochures I designed to mass-print in a quantity of 10,000 brochures. These would go out to churches, rec centers, elementary schools, libraries - you know, community orgs and entities. 

When designing the brochure I inserted a placeholder phone number that was just a random 800 number for proofing purposes (it wasn't meant to stay and was meant to be replaced by a real number to our location). The brochures were approved and sent to print. That placeholder number stayed.

When they came in, my manager and I were REALLY excited to see how they turned out (I worked really hard on them). We opened up the FedEx box, pulled them out and my boss turns to the page with the number and says ""Oh! You purchased a new number for this brochure?"" - I acted dumb to play it off and I couldn't say much but ""oh noo...."" 

She picks up the phone and dials it and the good news here is that it turns out it's not a fake number...the bad news was that it was a number to a phone-sex hotline.

I didn't get fired and my boss kept her composure quite well and just said ""okay...let's see how we can fix this"" - so I ordered a bunch of tiny permanent stickers to put over the brochure phone number.

TL;DR:","  Was in charge of designing educational brochures, accidentally included a random 800 number in the design which turned out to be a phone-sex hotline. Got a bunch of tiny permanent stickers to cover it up.","  Designed brochures, used a placeholder phone number temporarily to get approval, forgot number was there, printed 10,000 brochures with a sex hotline number on the back panel."

TITLE: I am a hypochondriac/OCD sufferer who has a chance to have regular sex with a really hot guy, but it's DIFFICULT when all you think about is STDs...

POST: **So, he's really, really hot.** And since I'm not the only one who thinks so, he has been with a lot of girls, and even a couple of guys. More than 100, he said. He doesn't quite know.
But! He gets tested (urine samples) regularly, the last time he checked out clean was three weeks ago. The bigger things, like HIV and Hep, he says he tests less frequently, but we live in one of the world's safest countries, there were only 122 new cases of HIV among sexually active men in 2012 (most recent statistics - gay or straight - yeah, I checked), and socialized medicine and strict rules makes it almost impossible not to be alerted within a relatively short timeframe after having had sex with someone who was positive.   
 
**I know this.**  
I also know how condoms work. However, I don't trust them. I think they'll break, or that something bad will happen somehow. I lube up, I (or he) puts them on the right way, we take every precaution - but I don't dare letting him finish. I have to tell him to quit, and then I finish him with a handjob or something. He says it's okay, but I hate being *that* girl, and I actually *want* him to fuck me long and hard, I just... I'm too scared. I even had him promise that if the condom broke, he'd go test himself for EVERYTHING just to be sure.   
  
**But here I am, freaking out.** Thinking the next time we have sex (if it's fair to even call ten or eleven thrusts sex), the condom will break and I will get AIDS.

**... And this guy is literally the nicest guy I have ever met.** He is thoughtful, kind, patient and he knows what he's doing - and he's totally honest. I want him bad. I don't know how to deal with this.

I also need to quit my job and have major surgery, but I cannot do either of those things for another couple months and have a plan for how that will go down. He's very ill himself, and he said my constant sadness was really wearing on him.

I have an appointment to get my blood drawn to see what's wrong with me physically. I am always fatigued, never get enough sleep, rarely feel good and energetic, and always have headaches. I made another appointment to go to a psychiatrist because I think my issues with depression are not just physical. They tend to get worse in the winter, and a month ago I seriously talked about killing myself, so I think that's what set all of this off. I don't think the illness *itself* bothers him, just the fact that I'm not trying to get better.

I'm thinking of just sending him a quick summary email in about a month to see what he thinks. I texted him this weekend (not the best idea but I'm OK with it) and he said there's a 2/3 chance he would take me back and that he still loves me.

TITLE: Contesting a failure to yield to emergency vehicle worth it?

POST: I got my first ticket for failure to yield to emergency vehicle. The violation code is 21806 (a) (1)  

I was driving less than a mile away from my house in the slow lane of a 2 lane divided highway road, and I noticed two stationary cop cars with lights on in the slow lane more than halfway away from what seemed to be a blocked intersection. I change lanes to get out of the cops way into the fast lane attempting to follow another car assuming they were going to make a u-turn to avoid the traffic accident up ahead.
As myself and the other car had passed the two stationary cops one rushes in to get between me and the car in front of me and the other cop behind me. The car in front stops in the fast lane and I signal and pull over by the side of the curb turn off my car.

A cop walks to my window and asks me whose car this is and where I was going. I reply and tell him where I was going, and he asks for my ID and insurance/registration and walks away for about 20 minutes. I notice during the wait that there are more cars making  u-turns before the intersection and told to stop  but they managed to continue making their turn and then to be told to turn the car around and one vehicle going straight through the intersection somehow without being pulled over.  I notice the car that had stopped in the middle of the road got a ticket and eventually the cop comes back hands me a ticket without explanation of what happened with a smile on his face and nicely asks me to sign it, and I do so out of fear so I can just go back home. :(

Would it be worth it to fight the ticket in court or pay the 490 dollar fine + 57 dollars for traffic school. I'm on a fixed income and can't afford a traffic lawyer.

His 16 year old brother recently came to visit us because he lives with a relative (both parents passed away). Now he is saying they do not treat him fairly, he is uncomfortable there, etc. Naturally fiancee wants to help his brother and told me if anything he will take is brother and raise him.

I know i sound self centered and i'm really trying not to be, because i know family comes first, but how can he make this decision that affects my life as well without consulting me? He never asked how I felt about it, or if i would even be willing to step in and help. I understand how he feels, and would do the same for a sibling in a heartbeat, but I would never just spring it on my partner like ""take it or leave it"". I think that is so effed up. Why should I have to put our plans on the backburner???

He is a great kid and it isn't anything personal, but we live in a cramped two bedroom one of which is currently being rented out, and the person is moving out soon, so we can prepare the room for future baby. Now it would essentially become his brothers room. I feel like what i want, and all of our plans are completely irrelevent and its his way or the high way.

TITLE: I [27M] cheated on my gf [25F] 3x during a weekend. It doesn't change that I love her

POST: So we got into a fight on a Thursday. She threw a huge tantrum and was just out of control. Because I'm a lawyer I stay rather calm, even when there's a fight and hate when it gets too emotional and dramatic. After an hour everything that can be said, is said. It just makes me feel so weird, when she keeps going. I just hate it. I don't make her responsible for it as a person, because every girl I've been with long enough has her moments.

Anyway. We got into the fight on a Thursday. On Friday she came around and she was being cute again. I didn't feel like it was over for me and I was annoyed that she thought it was okay just like that. Anyway, I left town the same day and stayed in San Diego over the weekend. The result was that I fucked 3 women until Sunday was over. To be honest, I didn't enjoy the sex that much. It's so much better with my girlfriend. Without emotions it doesn't mean much.

The last time I posted it, everyone told me to confess it, but I never planned to do that and I will not do it. There is no way to prove that it happened, not even I could prove it. She doesn't suspect a thing. I picked up the phone to talk to her even when someone else was there, so she thinks I was alone the whole time.

So I came back and now it's going better than ever. I realized that I want her and that as her boyfriend I am able to control her emotions a fair bit. Not in a mean way, but I want her to feel appretiated and happy, and not the need to start fights to get what she wants. Also I feel like that weekend gave me a chance to think about us and what I want. It's definitely her. She's beautiful, smart and 99% of the time super loving. I wouldn't want to miss her.

TL;DR:",  I cheated on my gf with 3 women during a weekend. It doesn't change that I love her and want her to feel appretiated and happy.,  Cheated on my gf 3 times during one weekend after a fight. But I feel a lot better about our relationship now and think it will work out well.

TITLE: I was charged several hundred dollars by a public college because my mother got cancer

POST: Some background: I'm a high school senior taking college courses because my school ran out. Most colleges I applied to require me to take four subject years and hopefully it lowers my college costs. I pay for these with my summer work money. It is currently the week before midterms in high school which is nonstop work, especially taking all max level classes. 

About two weeks ago, registration opened up for nonmatriculated students, so I signed up immediately. Last week, a fairly large operation was performed on my mother because of suspicious pains. 

The college emailed me a bill Friday, which saw on Tuesday. I did not see a deadline, just had an enormous amount of homework to complete for that day and was under pressure because my mother was still recovering. That day, an appointment was yesterday. Several details implied bad news, which caused considerable stress. I was with my family for much of the time after the school day ended, after which I worked on my school work until I had to leave for it. 

 The diagnosis came yesterday, with one of the deadliest forms, which basically consumed the rest of the day. 

The college called me at the end of the school day today to say next Monday is the deadline to pay. I checked my email shortly after to see that they had added an additional multiple hundred dollar late fee, despite billing me last Friday. I tried to call them again, several times, but their lines were full. 

Several of my full work days just disappeared as a result of the college billing me within the week that the operation and diagnosis were performed. I'm really pissed off because now, considering the likely cost of treatment, is when they would have made the most difference. There is no way for me to contact them now or before the payment deadline, so I have no choice.

TL;DR:","  My mother got cancer, college charged me several hundred dollars for bills that would have been avoided had I contacted them sooner. I'm pissed off and don't know what to do.","  Not knowing I had two days after seeing a bill to pay it, which were occupied by my mother's cancer diagnosis and nonstop schoolwork, I lost days worth of money as it became more important. I just needed to vent."

TITLE: Me [21F] with my bf [20M] of ten months never posts pictures of us, just of his car, etc.

POST: This may seem silly, but it's something that is bothering me. 
We have been happily dating for ten months, and I love him. I know he loves me. We have a healthy sex life, and we can talk about a lot of things.
Something as ""little"" as this shouldn't bother me, but it does.
He never posts about me or us on his social media. His last post of us or me was back on valentines day. And it wasn't even a romantic pic, just one of me helping him out with a chore of his.
What is the one and only thing he is posting about?
His damn car. Every day, multiple times a day, there is a new car pic, new tire pic, new pic about something to do with his car. It hurts, makes me feel like I'll always be second to his car.
Another thing; he doesn't have me in any of his profile pictures.
Another?; he doesn't have me tagged in his bio, our anniversary date or anything.
While all his friends do that, with profile pics and bios of their girlfriends on their pages, I get nothing. They post sweet things of themselves with their girlfriends, and I get nothing. I have mentioned this to him, and he just says ""its not who I am"". I asked him to try, to which he said he would. But I have seen nothing. I feel like he is hiding me, or doesn't want to show the world we are dating, which I am confused about, as when we first started dating, I was all over his social media. Now, nothing. I don't know if I am over reacting to this, but it hurts.
Any advice would be great, but please no one telling me I'm crazy, because I already question that about this issue everyday lol.
Thanks

TITLE: TIFU by having a crazy friend (poop, piss, trash and fleas)

POST: This happened a number of years ago. One of my old buddies kind of went crazy (too many hallucinogenic drugs) and he became super lazy. He stopped taking his dog outside to go to bathroom, so the guest room became the dog's poop and piss room. My friend also decided it was too much work to take the trash out to the dumpster so he started throwing the full trash bags into the poop and piss room too.

Eventually his power got shut off because he wasn't working or paying bills. This was in the middle of summer in Alabama. Needless to say the apartment became super hot and the fleas from his dog multiplied at an alarming rate. My friend eventually left, but didn't bring his dog with him.

My other friend and I had to go save the dog from the hell hole apartment. When we walked in, we were instantly covered in fleas up to our shins. It was terrifying! We grabbed the dog and ran. Not sure what ended up happening to the apartment, but I'm sure the people who cleaned it had to go in with haz-mat suits on haha.

My friend, whose jeep we used to rescue the dog, had to live with a new problem; his jeep got infested with fleas. He tried everything he could think of and eventually just had to set off bug bombs in his jeep. That jeep smelled like death for months after that.

TL;DR:","  My friend became super lazy and didn't take his dog outside to go to bathroom, so the guest room became his poop and piss room. Fleas infested the apartment for months.",  Friend let dog poop and pee in guest room. Friend threw bags full of trash into the poop and pee room. Power got shut off and the apartment turned into something from Fear Factor.

TITLE: I [23 F] keep thinking about my ex [23 M] and all the stupid what-if's.

POST: Friends for 2 years, dated for about half a year. Chemistry was there. 

Go out-of-state for a summer internship, get dumped via text. He says something about an epiphany and how he knows who he actually wants to be with. 

He is part of an organization that I am in and we see each other often. I pretend he doesn't exist and he does likewise. No contact, the routine after break-ups. 

Suddenly, half a year later, I'm hit with a torrent of what could have been and all that shit. I'm too prideful to ask him to take me back, especially since he desires someone else, but the thoughts won't stop. Everyday, I walk out of my house expecting him to be there like before. I want to call him

I impulsively talk to him today when I see him (facepalm). I speak with him the way I did in the past, full of jokes and an overabundance of info/commentary. I also am overly straight-forward and ask him to verify the name of the girl I think he wants to pursue. I don't care that he's realized I have feelings for him. I just want these stupid thoughts to leave. I would also prefer not to have feelings for him at all, ideally. Remember, for me, it feels like everything just suddenly hit me out of nowhere. 

My question would be what can I do to reach that state of ""moved on""? Any creative ideas? I have many hobbies that I partake in and interact with friends regularly, so I would prefer not to get responses like ""find a hobby/friends"".

TL;DR:","  Keep thinking about ex, half a year after break-up. I would prefer not to have feelings for him at all. What can I do to move on?","  I've become pathetic, pining after a guy. Would like to reach state of less pathetic. If more info is necessary, please let me know."

TITLE: BF (30/M) made fun of me (27/F) during oral sex and now I feel ashamed

POST: This will be a quick one (I hope) so bear with me.

Recently, I discussed with my boyfriend that I felt we weren't having enough sex anymore. We have been together for 2.5 years and the past few times we have hung out, we have not had sex or he rebuffed my advances. He chalked it up to low energy and stress a few things which I understood, but it just felt very off. Not only could I not recall when we were having sex but when we did it wasn't good at all. At first he didn't agree with my sentiment about less sex, and in fact decided to point out my own shortcomings (regarding domestic tasks) but he took the initiative to initiate and it's been great. In fact, we've been having some  of the best sessions we've ever had, and I feel that he used techniques he's never used before (sorry if it's TMI). I thought we were happy.

The next morning, we were joking around and it came to the point where I jokingly mentioned that he was trying to turn me into a housewife and he mentioned I was trying to turn him into a sex slave. That threw me off, but I let it go because I assumed he was joking. However, the very next day we were recalling the previous night's session and how much he enjoyed it. I casually brought up the sex slave comment. He then goes on to show the apparently grotesque face I made multiple times and how I was basically forcing his head.

It seemed like it was in the vein of joking but I felt humiliated. I feel sex is such a vulnerable state and his comments made me feel that he wasn't really into it and having a laugh at my expense, perhaps even resentful that he had to.  When I brought up that what he said was rude, he noted that he was just kidding and didn't mean anything by it. But isn't there a truth in joking? It makes me feel like I can't voice my concerns and now I feel insecure about doing those acts. Am I just being over sensitive?

TL;DR:",  Boyfriend made fun of me during oral sex and said I was forcing him to be sex slave. I feel ashamed and insecure about it now. Am I just being overly sensitive?,"  let my BF know that I felt our sex life had fallen off a bit, tried to rectify this but then he made rude comments that made me feel insecure about bringing it up at all."

TITLE: Me [19 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] wants to wait for marriage now after a year and a half of being sexually active

POST: My boyfriend of a year and a half and I went on a beach holiday a couple of days ago where he told me he would like to stop all sexual activity. We have a good relationship and a seemingly good sex life, he wasn't a virgin when we started dating and i'm finding all this hard to understand even though we've had a long conversation about it. He has a fairly high sex drive so i'm sure its not that he's disinterested. He claimed that it was because of a couple of things that he wanted to do this. Firstly because he was raised in a fairly religious household where they constantly preached marriage before sex and that he felt guilty for breaking that and was now trying to make up for it. He said mostly though it was because he felt like he needed to respect me and the relationship more by not being so focused on sex. 

I respect his decision in all of this and am willing to wait if thats what he really needs. I've also never seen him as happy as he was after he made this decision, he said he felt like a weight had been lifted off him and that he could finally love me properly. I don't want to take this away from him but i'm scared for what this means in our relationship. Its one thing for a relationship to progress knowing you both want to wait for marriage, but another thing to go backwards from that kind of physical relationship. I was happy in our relationship and how it was but i now feel restricted, like there are now boundaries that i can't cross and i now can't be fully relaxed and me. I don't want to have to repress my sexual desires and needs but it sounds selfish to say so. I'm really not sure how to go about this because i love him and i won't leave him over this.

POST: My BF [28M] And I [27F] have been dating a little over a year and he is very emotionally detached and very unaffectionate.  I always feel like he's not really into me and his actions totally show it but then when I confront him about it we just fight and he says he wants to stay with me and just isn't an affectionate person?  

I really like him because we do have fun together when we do hang out but I feel like lonely and unloved majority of the time and it's shitty!  And he can go days without talking to me or seeing me.  Wouldn't you want to spend time with your gf!?  I ask him that too and his response is he doesn't miss anyone it's not just me but in the beginning he used to tell me he missed me...

Should I just end things or are there ways to maybe fix it? I mean he says he doesn't want to break up but like it's unfair to me how unavailable he always is! 

And it's not like he's doing something important he just would rather be with his friends over me.  Idk maybe it's me! Maybe I'm super lame or something!  I can't say he's keeping me around just to get laid bc we don't alway have sex when we do hang out? 

I guess he lost affection towards me bc I can be a little paranoid and I accuse him of cheating on me when he is away but only because he's unaffectionate so when you think someone's not into you your brain will take you places!

TITLE: I [19/M] Think I've fallen for her [19/F], but it's become complicated. Need some advice what to do.

POST: Hi. I met a girl several months ago at College on an academic fieldtrip where we went abroad with our course for a week. We got on while we were there, but when we arrived back home neither of us spoke to each other for a while.

A few days later she started speaking to me and we really began to hit it off. It got to the stage where we were speaking almost all the time, whether it was by text or by Facebook or face-to-face, and one day we got onto the topic of relationships with a mutual friend. I found out that she was not looking for anything, and neither was I, so I thought nothing of it. 

We began to speak less and less over time, and more recently we've been speaking once every few days; a quick text here or there. Earlier on she text me and we got onto the conversation of our plans for the evening. This is when she told me she was going to a guy's house who she was romantically interested in. I was happy to hear this because I love her as a friend and I truly want the best for her, but I can't help but feel a sickening feeling in my stomach, and I can't put my finger on it. 

I think I've fallen for her, as hard as I tried not to, and I'm feeling pretty shitty at the moment. I don't take it personally that she likes this guy and I'm happy things are going well for her. My emotions were all over the place about this. I just wish I told her when I had the chance about my feelings for her. I don't know whether I should be cutting contact with her or being there as one of her best friends and supporting everything she does. I love her too much as a friend just to cut everything. I'm feeling so conflicted and need help with what to do. Thanks

TITLE: Me (23M) am having a hard time understanding GF's (23F) ""connecting"" behavior

POST: So I've been dating this girl for about a year. Things are good, and I think we get along very well. We have our tiffs but hey what couple doesnt.

What bothers me though is that shes claims that she must meet as many people as possible; shes really obsessed with ""connecting"" with people. 

The other day when we went out with a bunch of her friends to a bar, she got the number of numerous guys. From what I saw, it was rather innocent in context, but it just bothered me a bit that it seemed like she was actively coming up with ""list"" of people she can get with after we're done... I feel like if I did the same, shed be uncomfortable too.

When I asked her about it, she said it was just for friendly encounters and that she just wanted to ""connect"" with people. Now mind you, she does do this a lot. Shell just go to some random store owned by a man clearly in his 50s/60s and will be very friendly with him because she wants to connect... I dont think this is sexual in nature.

I just dont know if this is normal behavior but anyway.

Before me, shes dated plenty of guys which is fine. But one gets to me more than the others. Apparently on a trip to thailand, she wanted a lay and hooked up with a hostel bartender. Then after the vacation, she went back to further ""connect"" with him. But it seems now that she has no desire to connect with him, and Im starting to think her hyper ""connection"" behavior is some sort of odd... I dont know scapegoat for something. 

Am I being a bit too jealous? Should it bother me that shes still actively seeking male friends? (its really the motive that bothers me). It seems really strange to me that someone is so desperately in need to connect with people.

TL;DR:",  GF claims to be obsessed with connecting with people. Seems to be actively seeking male friends. I feel weird about it.

TITLE: Not sure if I want to stay in my LTR

POST: Backstory: my boyfriend and I dated for 3 years in college, broke up because I (28F) cheated. Got back together 5 years later, now have been together 2 years and living together for 5 months. 

The problem: I don't know if I want to stay in the relationship. 

Here's why: 
I recently came to terms with the fact that I'm an alcoholic (sober 4 months). I also have bipolar disorder (medication/therapy managed). My father died 6 months ago and that sent me into kind of a tailspin. I then moved across the state to be with boyfriend and closer to my mom, and started a new job (which I love). I've been away from therapy for a few months due to this transition. Adjusting to living with boyfriend has not been easy...I require more space/alone time than he does, and once you live with someone all the things that bugged you about them before become more pronounced. All this to say that I've been more moody/touchy/unstable than I was for the past year. Previously I had been ready to get married and spend my life with this guy, then about a month into living together it's like everything changed out of nowhere. And now I'm avoiding sex with him like the plague and sometimes the thought makes me physically ill. Confession: I started to develop feelings for someone else and I'm not quite sure if it's because he has been helping me in early sobriety or if it's more than that. Anyway, the point is that I now have some good days/weeks where I feel like my old self and am ready to marry this guy again, other weeks I can't stand him. I feel guilty because I'm the one who cheated years ago, then I'm the one who begged him to take me back, so how could I leave after that?? So there's a lot of shit going on and I don't know where I'm at or what I should do. I'd appreciate some advice.

TL;DR:","  came to terms with alcoholism and bipolar disorder, moved in with boyfriend, things have changed and I'm now moody/unstable. Not sure if I want to stay in LTR.",  not sure if I wanna stay in my LTR and have a lot of personal turmoil in the past six months. Need advice please.

POST: Like I said we've been together just over a year, living together for 4-5 months. Since we began dating we've been both working afternoon shift with the same days off, which really works out to a lot of time together. 

Now he wants to go to midnight shift, because it's less stressful. Now I agree with that, but it could be years (probably 1-3) before I could switch. That would leave me coming home to an empty house, eating dinner alone, and going to bed alone every evening after work. 

We've discussed in depth how much that upsets me, and how important it is to me that he not go through with this. However, he feels it's very important to his mental health that he not miss this opportunity. 

My suggestion was that he just wait for a bit until we can both get midnight shift. But his is that he takes it as soon as it's available, and I just wait until it's available to me. 

Now, I've never asked him to do anything big for me. I called off a wedding, broke off an engagement, moved out on my own, and recently we moved in together... All because I wanted to be able to spend more time with him. This is the first important thing I've asked for, and I feel dismissed. 

He says he will gladly give me whatever I ask for, at any time, but this is something he can't budge on. All I want is his time, so I don't see how he could make it up to me

POST: We've only been dating for 5 months and I know that the age difference has caused her stress. I've never met her parents and she's convinced that they won't accept me and will potentially disown her. I've only met one of her friends, for only a few minutes and things were cordial but apparently that friend is also disapproving of our relationship. 

Over the past couple of weeks she's been extremely affectionate, constantly telling me she loves me when we're together and texting/calling to tell me how much she misses me when we aren't. This was a big deal because before she said it for the first time she was convinced that she'd never be in love with anyone. The first time she told me, she cried hysterically. 

Sunday night we got into a small argument which turned into a breakup argument in which she told me that she's not positive she's in love with me and though she likes me ""more than a lot"", she isn't always happy in her life and thinks that she should be happier. According to her, it ""isn't enough."" 

I should add that this is the 3rd time we've broken up under similar circumstances. In the past she's always regretted her decision and come back. I love her but I don't know how much more of this I can take. The way we left it, she told me she wasn't sure if she wanted to break up or not and just needed time to think, but she sure seems to be leaning in the direction of ending it.

POST: I've always been socially isolated (usually a small group of close friends, made up of people who are themselves social outsiders.) In the past two years, I've been on one date; in the past four years, I've been in one relationship; my last sexual encounter was now over six years ago.

I'm now 24, and am about to return to college following a three-year absence (I flunked out cause I wasn't doing any of the work.) I plan to be quite busy, as I'll be pursuing double majors in math and computer science, and would rather not delay my graduation any more than I already have. Still, I figure this is a good chance to get back into the world.

I have a few rules/hangups that might interfere with the, er, sketchier advice people seem to give college guys; they basically boil down to ""I refuse to mischaracterize myself or my intentions,"" ""I refuse to have any romantic or sexual contact with anyone I don't genuinely respect.""

Past that... just looking for general advice on getting out there, meeting people, and moving things forward. I really have no idea how most of this stuff works; I've only been in two relationships, and both of them came about because me and the girl fell for each other so hard that the actual details of what I said/did didn't really matter. I'm woefully unimpressed by what I've seen of the way most people go about this, and am looking for more... open, mature and honest strategies. Theoretically I'm interested in either serious or casual stuff, but it feels like almost everything I have going for me applies more to serious relationships.

More info (my relationship history, my strengths and weaknesses, my looks) on request, but I don't want to make this any longer than necessary. Brutal honesty appreciated, especially if you see a weakness or shortcoming that it doesn't look like I'm aware of.

TL;DR:","  24 year old returning to college after a long absence, looking for advice on how to meet people, move things forward, and generally get out there and start making a name for myself.","  Life-long loner going back to college, looking for advice on how to get into dating and stuff.

TITLE: How do I keep two corgis entertained when they don't seem that interested in each others' company?

POST: The quick rundown is that I don't live with my two dogs anymore so I have to make the most of the time that I see them.  When I visit, they get really excited for a few hours while I run around and play with them.  After a bit, they seem to get really bored and become super depressed.  The following days they just mope around bored and depressed -- they already know I'm around, it's not exciting anymore, they're just bored.  They don't even play with each other.

Occasionally I invent new games for them to play and it's pretty amazing.  I played the shell game with my older dog (his name is dante) and it was like he came alive for the first time.  After a few hours he was cheery straight through the next day, but after a few repeat games he got bored of that too.  I see them so rarely, I want to be able to keep them happy whenever I do show up.  Does anyone know of some unusual dog games?

POST: We have been best friend for 4 years, both have had a serious relationship with other people during that time. During the last 2 years we have been single but have had flings with other people.
I have secretly liked her for the last 2 years but decided to stay a friend because I didn't want to ruin things between us.

I finally confessed and told her I couldn't be her friend without having feelings for her. Initially asked her how she felt about me and she said she only saw me as a friend. I gave her an ultimatum, we try dating or I stop talking to her and move on.

In the end we decide to give it a shot. She wants to take things slow. How long is reasonable time to give this? How many dates?
I fear that because I have liked her for so long and feel like if I wait too long and end up being rejected that it will hurt me more.

TITLE: I (21M) perfectly set the board, but continuously fail at execution. Talk some courage into me! How can I overcome my hesitations?

POST: I am 100% certain this girl, let's call her Emily (19F), likes me.

We have been on a date, and had a couple of ""afternoon hang-outs,"" over the past three weeks. Hopefully, we are going on our second proper date this Friday evening. 

Problem is I suck at physical escalation. I never know when it's ""appropriate"" to take her hand, or put an arm around her shoulder. As a result, we still have not kissed (I tried at the end of date 1, but she turned her cheek as it was sort of out of left field), and I keep failing at getting physical. I did finally hold her on a walk home after a party last night, but chose not to kiss her goodnight because I felt I should properly earn it when we are both sober. 

Part of my problem stems from the fact that Emily is shy. I notice at practice she only talks a couple other girls for instance. I find it cute, and don't mind in the slightest, but it it also means I have a harder than normal time reading when is a good time to ""move in,"" as she tends to show less emotion. 

I am certain she still likes me, and have received enough positive signs to know I have not yet been placed in the dreaded ""friend zone."" We text daily, she got me birthday chocolates, and she positively mentioned our first date a full week after we went out.

Now, however, I know I need to make a move. I need to kiss her on Friday. I need to spark physical attraction to kiss her. I need to find courage to stop-doubting myself and just take her hand to spark physical attraction. I have analyzed and over-analyzed the situation, and am really confident we can soon be dating. I just need to find inner-strength and stop hesitating. So talk me up, and how can I overcome these lingering self-doubts?

TITLE: My best friend [f21] demands too much attention and I [f22] don´t know what to do.

POST: Hello there.
This girl [f21] and I [f22] have been friends for almost 6 years. We share a lot of common interests and hobbies and we work together. Our relationship has had some ups and downs (My ex fell in love with her, she rejected him and I forgave him, just to dump him later) but lately, there is something that has been bothering me.
I cannot speak with her the way I used to; I do not want to tell her about some things I do, about the guy I am dating, or about anything else that is not related directly to her. She got angry when I told her some things about my life, and she seems to need the assurance that I am going to be there for her all the time. Also, she knows how to manipulate me and make me feel like everything bad that happens is my fault. I know she has problems at home but I am simply not able to give her that much attention, specially since she is the type of girl who gets a lot of attention for being pretty and interesting and all that.
So, right now, I do not know what to do: I don´t want to ""save"" her from her problems, because I tried and it only went for the worse, I just want to stop feeling like I am walking among eggshells with her, and that anything I do in our relationship is wrong or it does not fit on what she wants.

I learned she was a huge hockey fan, so I asked her a few days afterwards if she wanted to go to a game with me. Her response: *""You are so sweet, but I feel really bad as I definitely wouldn't want you to buy my tickets! I would love to go see a game. I'm happy to do anything, it doesn't have to be as pricey!""*

I told her that of course I would pay for the tickets since I had invited her to the game and that I was happy to buy them.  But she responded saying she still wanted to go out but she couldn't accept my offer to buy the tickets. (We are talking about $50 tickets here, nothing too outrageous).

We agreed to watch the game on TV instead together.  **Should I surprise her and buy the tickets anyways?  Or do you think she actually doesn't want to go like she says?**

TITLE: Need help picking out a new laptop for college.

POST: For most of high school, I've been the go to ""computer kid."" I'll be the first to admit that I know a lot about how computers work, and often fix things for teachers before the IT guys have a chance to get a whack at them. I worked at a computer repair shop for half a year as a technician. I've done the typical tech guy thing and drooled over new computers that come out (read: Wired/PopSci/2600 articles and centerfolds). 

That said, I have NO IDEA what kind of computer to get for college. I've always wanted to buy a ton of parts and build my own ""super"" desktop, but I for sure need a laptop. If everything goes according to plan, I'm enrolling at Champlain College next Fall to double major in Computer Network Information Security and Digital Forensics. 

A lot of you probably already know this, but this major involves a lot of virtual desktops. Essentially I set up entire networks on my own rig and then go in and play around with them, all from one computer. It takes a lot of processing power and hard drive space.

Over the years I've built up several stereotypes about different brands, operating systems, products... Recently, my mind has been opened back up and I'm willing to take a look at anything, even a Dell or an Asus.

It's recently been brought to my attention that Macs are actually pretty good. I've always been a notorious Windows-only-guy. I finally decided to bite my tongue and take a look under the hood, and my god are these things powerful... I guess it really does help making everything but the processor in-house.

Anywho, what I really need is suggestions that might work well for my major, hopefully staying under a budget of $1600. Also, what are the big differences between a MacBook and  MacBook Pro?

TITLE: Handicapped Hell

POST: First time poster, please be gentle!!

So a little backstory, I'm 17 and I have a handicapped placard because back in July I broke part of my spine in a weird, stair-related accident. I'm perfectly okay now, but walking long distances still hurts. I generally try to park without using the placard, but if there are no spaces or the only spaces available are really far away, I'll park in a handicapped spot. 

Now, I live in a town KNOWN for having almost nothing but old people and beaches- it's basically a retirement community. A lot of the old people have handicapped cards just for being old. I tend to get a lot of glares when I walk out of my car after parking with the placard up because I appear fine. 

Today, I went to the grocery store and was looking for a spot to park when I noticed someone had parked across two handicapped spots and a crosswalk. I was in more pain with my back than usual, and this really pissed me off. 
So I did what any logical human would do. 
I parked a few spaces down, went to the cart return, and absolutely surrounded their car with at least 20 empty carts.

TL;DR:","  I broke part of my spine, have a handicapped placard, and was parking with it today when someone parked across two handicapped spaces and a crosswalk.

POST: In June of 2015 I was laid off from my job. I was lucky enough to be paid out through the end of August and collected unemployment thereafter. Unfortunately, prior to being laid off I had a lot of medical issues (2 endoscopies, an ambulance ride, and a colonoscopy) so needless to say the lay off was really bad timing. 

Now I'm totally drowning in debt, and feeling defeated. I've applied for so many jobs had a bunch that went to 3rd and 4th interviews, but nothing has amounted to anything. It's been almost a year since I've had a job and I have a hard time doing anything productive every day now. I just look at my computer and freeze up.

I am lucky enough to have a very supportive girlfriend and parents who are helping me how they can. Even with amazing support, I feel depressed, defeated, and as low as I've every felt.

How do people find the motivation to keep at it after so much failure and financial stress? I'm really reach for any sort of guidance I can get now because I'm completely lost.

POST: Two days ago me and my SO of 1.5 years had an argument. Nothing weird all couples have arguments, and we have had others. 

*For some back ground info: He is a full-time student who's mom pays for everything he wants, and I work 180 hours a month on the overnight shift, so I am not home a lot.* 

This one was different though. We argued because he lied to one of his friends about me. I asked him about it and he explained he did not mean me, he meant his ex and forgot to put it. Later on I asked if he wanted to go with me to a family function, to which he replied 

* ""actually can you drop me off at my friend's (same friend he lied to) house on the way instead? 

I replied ""K"" because I was insulted and mad at the same time (He does this all the time.) to which he said never mind then. After that I told him that I did not like that he asked to go to the friends house that he lied to, especially since he never set it straight. 

That resulted in him turning it around on me and making me feel like shit. He made comments about my weight, me not trusting him, the fact that he has paid more of the bills than me, that I'm not a house SO that stays home all day and cleans it.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my girlfriend [16 F] of 4 months, is her in high school, me in uni weird? Is she taking her friends words too seriously?

POST: Alright, so my girlfriend of 4 months, it's nothing super serious as of yet, but we're really close and she's perfect, laid-back, doesn't complain when I hang out with my friends and don't talk to her for a couple of hours but, last night she sent me a weird message and I wasn't sure how to take it.

The message read ""Do you feel like you dating someone in highschool whilst you're in uni is going to hold you back from anything?"" (I asked her what the anything was and she put emphasis on girls, and just things in general).

I gave her a long response about how I really feel and in a nutshell she would never hold me back from doing something, and if I thought about being with other girls, I shouldn't be in a relationship.

She responded basically with just ""Glad I won't be keeping you from anything"" and she thought she was the reason my friends and I had a little argument last month, but she had nothing to do with it.

I personally feel maybe it was an underlying attempt to get me to think about our relationship, a lot of people have mentioned our age difference which is about 1.5 years and to me that's nothing really, my Nanna and Grandad met when they were 18 and 15, but times do change. And I feel she maybe has taken what people have said about the small gap really hard, but she's never mentioned it until now.

It's only a small time of dating, I'm her first boyfriend and maybe she doesn't know what to expect, I've tried to like, be understanding if she's feeling awkward in certain situations to help. 

I'm unsure of what her message meant if anything, did she really just want me to think about that or did she want me to re-evaluate my choice of dating her rather than going for new girls at university, but I have no interest in them and I haven't even thought about leaving her to explore other options in my new environment.

TITLE: NONROMANTIC Me (20s) having issue with friend (20s) being a SAHM

POST: Greetings,
First off I will point out I am not against stay at home moms, I want to make this very clear.

My friend who I have known since college got into a relationship, married and had a premie child in under a year, since then she has insisted that she cannot work, and that her husband work 60+ hours between 2-3 part time jobs to support them. 

Since the child was born she has become a helicopter parent, very rarely letting others watch her child, claiming the child has several disorders (some have been diagnosed, others haven't) No one is good enough to watch her child.

It's been over 2 years, and she is still insistent on being a stay at home mom even though her husband brings in under 30K to support them and is very rarely home. She is constantly complaining about communication and financial issues to me, I keep suggesting she looks to find work as currently neither her nor her husband have health insurance, the toddler is covered by government support. 

Any time I bring it up, she gets very defensive and claims that ""family is the most important thing"" and she ""doesn't want a stranger raising her child""  She will make excuses that childcare is to expensive (which it is pricey) but many moms do go back to work.

To make matters worse, she knows I am fairly well off, and will often ""attack"" me for not understanding financial hardships, or not understanding being a mom. While I have been lucky, I have also been living off of about 900, to 1500 a month while I'm finishing school. So it's not like I haven't (or am) experienced budgeting, or being low income.

I've been losing respect for her as I think she could help with the financial issues they are currently facing. She has a college degree, he doesn't.  On top of the low income, they have several loans to pay off. Am I horrible for wanting to cut ties? Has anyone else been able to keep a friendship in this situation? 
I feel very stressed by this friendship currently.

TITLE: Court House/Backyard Wedding advice needed!

POST: Hello!  I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. 

My FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  

To top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. 

Anyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. 

He is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. 

So now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.  Would 3-4 months be enough time to plan a simple backyard ceremony/reception?  Anybody have experience with either elopment or backyard weddings?

POST: This is my first post on this subreddit, and I really need some insight on whether or not I'm in the right mindset here. 

We've been together for a year. She was my first ""I love you"" relationship. Early on, I did have hunches that she didn't find me attractive very much but that insecurity always blew away somehow and I didn't think about it again. Recently though, I've noticed that we haven't had sex in a while; she's also been pushing me to work out recently, too. 

Just 10 minutes ago, I asked her if she's ever had sexual attraction to other men. She said yes. I asked her if she finds me sexually attractive right now, and she said no. Then she said she values personality over looks. She doesn't think physical attraction is a huge aspect in a relationship. ""People get tired of each other after 20 something years of marriage; attraction shouldn't matter much then,"" she said. 

I, on the other hand, value physical attraction a lot. I think it's a core facet of a relationship, and it wouldn't be a relationship if it weren't for that romantic/sexual factor. That's what separates things from a friendship. 

I feel like I'm young, and I shouldn't stay with someone who isn't making me happy. I also feel like she deserves someone who she finds attractive, and I deserve someone who finds me attractive. 

But Im a little bit unsure about whether or not I made the right choice. 
Am I missing anything?

I'll make sure this will be cool with his roommate, whom is also a friend. Ryan asked me to watch and exercise his dog while he's away, so I have permission and access in his house.

Completely out of left field, the lady showing us the car just called to tell me that she found it in the trunk... sigh... I told my buddy and he agreed that if I paid the balance for his new one I could just keep his old one. Problem is: I'm pretty smart phone illiterate and was planning to get a new one after I got a car and re-saved up the money for it (rockin' a pre-pay tank of a Nokia like a hipster). So is there any way I can set it up so I can have and use his old one? Keep in mind that we did report it stolen.

TITLE: Dear professors/college graduates, I need your help

POST: Hi Reddit,

I'm currently a 2nd year undergrad student majoring in bio. I thought I wanted to be a pharmacist back in high school, but I've found tht bio isn't exactly my thing. After fall quarter, I'll be on academic probation for the second time under the school of biology. A part of me is really hard-headed and doesn't want to admit that due to my past disregard for my academics, I can no longer achieve a competitive GPA unless I buckle down and shut out the world for the next 3 years. Realistically, I don't think that's going to happen. Though I have some interest in bio, I have no passion for it.

My parents keep on telling me it's do-able with hard work, and they've been such a big source of support and motivation, but other than them, I have no motivation for staying in bio. My parents always tell me that while I have the oppurtunity, I should aim for the highest possible accomplishments since I'm attending a good university, and I agree with them. But I don't know if I should aim for that under bio. They really want me to stay and become involved in the medical field since ""that's where the money is."" I don't argue with them about that point since I know how important money is to support a family, but I know that I'm not fit for the medical field. 

What I've always really wanted, but locked away because I knew it is impractical, was to become a teacher. Becoming a high school teacher is fine with me, but I'm looking to be able to support myself with no ones help. I don't know if I can with their salary. Recently, I've come up with a solution to this problem that will make my parents happy, as well as myself. My idea is to become a professor in something I'm passionate about. So... what should I do? I'm contemplating switching into philosophy or something in humanities. I know that I'll definitely be happier if I do, and I see myself achieving more in that field versus science. Also, are there any professors out here that would like to share their story with me? Tips and advice from anyone else would be appreciated as well.

TL;DR:","  Currently on academic probation for the second time under the school of biology, considering switching into something I'm passionate about to support myself and possibly become a professor.

TITLE: Me [23 M] with my fiancee [21 F] 2 months engaged - arranged (she lives abroad) marriage stuff - and I saw a hooker

POST: Hi...(repost from /r/confessions)

So I have been setup for arranged marriage (I was initially enthusiastic) and have been engaged since end of March. We're muslims so obviously no sex before marriage, and as this is arranged we have not developed emotional closeness like a standard BF/GF couple in West has. We live in different countries, talk on whatsapp etc, but thats it, 

Yesterday, I saw a prostitute. This was after 5 months (almost) of being clean, just sticking to standard porn etc. Before those 5 months i.e. prior to January, I regularly saw prostitutes, and I just was getting tired of it, of the emotional tiredness.

Talking to a friend, one solid course of action to take, as it seems I have commitment issues and am unable to work on myself, is to cancel engagement now, despite wedding being in 2 months, deal with backlash which will be limited, and figure things out alone, rather than bring the poor girl on the end of it into things.

Other option - shut up, put up, try and carry on strong as wedding comes up, and hope/pray/make best effort that I will not cheat or do this stuff again during remaining engagement period and ultimately never again in marriage....

Easy decisions for a sleazeballlll

What should I do?

TL;DR:","  Been engaged for 2 months, saw hooker 5 months prior to engagement, should I cancel engagement now, deal with backlash, or try and carry on strong as wedding comes up?","  Engaged in arranged marriage, messed up with prostitute, now what do I do?

TITLE: My [19M] ex [18F] has just entered a new relationship, and it's tearing me apart.

POST: So, my first ever real relationship started when I was about 14, and me and her were together for nearly four years. 

We lost our virginities to each other, and we thought we'd be together for ever, etc. We split up about eight months ago due to our relationship falling apart quite a bit, and the fact that I was moving away to university acted as a catalyst as well. 

Now I've been at university for around six months, and I thought I'd moved on completely, until now, when she told me she is now in a new relationship. It feels horrible knowing that she's being intimate with someone other than me. I don't think I'm still in love with her, but I don't know why I'm feeling like this, I've been sitting in my room feeling sorry for myself all day, and I just can't shake it off.

Our break up was by now means clean and simple, and it took a while after we broke up officially to actually stop seeing each other and having sex etc. 

Another relevant detail could be that the guy she is currently seeing, she had a slight thing with at a festival when we were together, and there was always a bit of tension about him when we were together.

Can anyone help me with trying to get over her? Or working out why I'm feeling like this? I know this isn't a huge issue, and it's probably really common, I just don't know where else to go for help. Thanks.

We work in a Physiotherapy Clinic and we have 3 members of the same family coming in to see him so I piped up and said ?I b et you can?t get the mom to make an appointment? and so it began. We drew up a contract that stated that the mom must make an appointment before 5pm on Thursday July 12, 2012. If she made the appointment my co-worker and I would have to call our boss ?Supreme Master of the Universe? for 2 straight days. If she did not make the appointment he had to sing every single request for us for 2 straight days. So she leaves and makes an appt for her and we all think the bet is over. He won. He cashes in on his bet for the next 2 days. It is now 3 days later and I find out she cancelled her appointment but he never told anyone. I need a seriously good retaliation for this. It will not go unnoticed. He can definatly take a joke and is extremely pompous. I need your ideas to exact revenge.

POST: Alright. So the abridged version is basically we got into it because I looked at a celebrity gossip website randomly and she thought that was weird. Told her I looked at it because I'm fascinated by celebs (who hasn't thought it be cool to b a celebrity?) and she said she can't be with someone who want to be a celebrity so bad (I don't). So she asked to look through my phone history to see and I mentioned I delete my history. (I do. No real reason just always have. Not hiding anything) she says I'm sketchy. I say I can't be with someone who doesn't trust me. She throws my phone and starts walking away. I get in front if her and lightly push her to stop her from walking. Some random guy outside screams ""hey don't touch a girl like that"" She then proceeds to squeez my arm with her until it bleeds. She then slapped my head several times. After this she said she wanted to go home and I offered to give her a ride.  On the way home she proceeded to call me the scum of the earth, said she can't believe the way that I treat her. And I'm abusive.  Told me I don't deserve anyone because I put my hands on her.  What should I do I've never been in love before and this is my first real relationship.

POST: My girlfriend was at the gym when a personal trainer approached her and he said she had a good shape and was working hard but that she was fat and offered to do something about that by giving her free training sessions.

To me this seems like an intentional put down to make her eventually want to pay for his sessions. She was happy about getting offered free ones, but with her history of bulimia I'm pretty angry that she's being called fat like that by someone who's trying to exploit her.

I had started expressing my concerns but I could tell it was annoying her because she wanted this to be a good thing but I had to get this off my chest and so sent her a message saying the above and that I loved her and it bothered me someone's insulting her like that.

She hasn't replied to this yet. Am I in the right here or will she be thinking I'm the asshole now?

TITLE: Friends with benefits question

POST: i broke up with my ex girlfriend of four years in february. quickly after that, i started texting a friend who was going through a similar situation with her boyfriend. we started texting all the time. i usually don't text all that much, but it was at work, after work, first thing in the morning. it's been like that about a month and a half.

after a lot of sexual tension building up, we ended up sleeping together. we still continued talking just as much with the only difference occasionally talking about sex with each other, instead of sex with other people. we both decided that we would continue having sex when we are able to see each other (we live in different cities) but it hasn't been the focus of our conversations; it does come up with the occasional sext session. we had a very strong connection to begin with after being there for each other during difficult times in both of our lives. there have been times where she's been hot/cold on the sexual stuff, but the amount of texting has remained fairly consistent.

this weekend things seemed a little off. the amount of texting, and the responses i was getting were different. a lot fewer, slower responses, and they were much shorter, as to not keep the conversation going. that continued through today, and she has nearly stopped talking to me altogether today. she said she's busy and has a lot going on, she does, but she's been busy since we started talking. between work, her ex situation, she had a death in her family, she's always texted, until now. even without the sex, i do miss having somebody to talk to so i stayed occupied after the break up, but i'm trying to give her space.

i have a trip planned to see her this weekend, i have refundable tickets, so it wouldn't be an issue to cancel, but i would like to see her.

after all of the back story, here are my questions. should i brush off the lack of communication and go with it until it either picks back up again, or becomes the new normal? should i offer to cancel my trip since she is so busy?

POST: Title pretty much sums it up.

My boyfriend went to go live with family in another state after we got evicted for awhile and so we're doing LDR visit stuff I guess. For context, we started dating in March 2015, and I moved in with his best friend in June 2015. He moved in too, and we got evicted in May 2016 from our own place. 

I'm someone who loves to do special things like go out to eat, swim, spend time, ect during special moments. He is an introvert and we are both broke, so I want to avoid going out and spending money. Garb loves Italian food, and spending time inside playing video games. 

I'm a terrible, horrible cook. I can cook 3 things really well. Everything else is ungodly most of the time. It sucks, but it's not everyone's thing. I want to make a special meal for him, but I don't want to waste a bunch of money ruining stuff until I get it right. 

I also have no idea what to do. I don't want to spend all day inside playing games and not saying much to each other and whatnot, cuz that was what we normally did when he was here. Going over the top isn't what I'm looking for, I just want to do something out of the way and sweet, but I'm at a loss. We both play Pokemon Go, so that's definitely stuff we're gonna be doing,  but I want to put more effort into making this sweet.

We are both Nintendo nerds big time, and like a lot of youtubers that do stuff similar to our tastes.

POST: I slept with my ex (let's call him Kurt) in June, 3 months into my relationship with my current ex-boyfriend (who we'll call Harry). I cheated because I thought the relationship was going nowhere & that I was going to end it. But then things changed.

I did not sleep with Harry until that August (after the cheating episode with Kurt). Soon after I fell in love with him & sleeping with Harry was amazing.

Harry dumped me in March for a trust issue, which turned into my confession about the cheating with Kurt.
I no longer talk to Kurt in any way, shape, or form.

Harry was extremely hurt, for good reason. We're now in no-contact this month and it's killing me. I have been unfollowed on Twitter and unfriended on Facebook. Is this due to the no-contact protocol, or do you think he's trying to move on?

TITLE: I think I'm experiencing dating fatigue...

POST: For a bit of background information, I am a 23 year old female who is currently in graduate school at a small arts school. After about a year and a half of being single, I decided recently I should try to get myself back into the dating arena with the goal of finding a fulfilling long-term relationship. For some context, the last relationship I had was in a different state when I was at a different school and didn't end particularly well.

I've been having a really hard time meeting people in my new state / city / school for various reasons, some of which I'm guessing at. In order to combat this, I decided to try online dating. I had been on OKC before (which is actually how I met my last boyfriend), but I hadn't had much success in my new area so I decided to shell out the money for Match.com. It's been going... alright. I live about an hour between two major cities so most of my matches are within one or the other. I have been talking to one guy quite a bit, but due to conflicting schedules and the distance, I haven't actually gotten the chance to *meet* him, and probably won't for another week or so. 

Basically, I'm posting this for several reasons: 1. I am burned out from the dating. I would love a relationship, but I hate the kind of work it takes to get to a person you want to be with. How do I have fun with dating? 2. I feel like I need to give more people a chance, especially this guy I've been chatting with, but at what point do I need to just say, ""we need to meet or I'm out""? Or for that matter, how much of a chance should I give *anyone*? How do I know when I'm being too picky? 3. How do you meet people you might be interested in a small area with a busy schedule without much opportunity to branch out of your regular community?

This is sort of a rant as well, so I apologize if anything is unclear and feel free to ask me to clarify or go into more detail. I'm just pretty frustrated about the situation and would love some thoughts, or just to talk it out. And if nothing else, thanks for listening Reddit.

POST: It's kind of self explanatory but it's really very frustrating. 
I am going to Bangkok on the 9th and I'm trying to book a hotel. Now I'm not a total dweeb, I have booked loads of flights, hostels, hotels, buses and trains on a very tight budget before this. I feel like I'm alright with dodging the usual scams and tricks, clearing my cache and history to try to avoid trackers, using incognito mode in Chrome, but this time it is just not working. 

After narrowing down the thousands of options to four hotels/hostels. I picked my favourite, then looked on the booking sites all at the same time (via Quidco to save a few bob), they were all a similar price so I decided to book. 

The first one said this ""Due to a change in availability, this rate has increased since you made your selection"" so onto the next one, what a surprise, the same thing... or words to that effect, it has happened on each website I have been on. They all conveniently went up to the same price. 

I have tried it with eight different hotels on each booking website, and every one has done the same. How can they get away with doing this? As it's clearly not people booking in the time of me clicking on to the website and then onto book. 

More importantly, is there anything I can do to get around it? Have you guys had similar experiences?

POST: My SO and I have been dating for three years. He's my best friend and the one person that actually gets me.

He's been there for me through my parent's divorce, through my grandmother's episode with cancer, and through my stressful life at school. I started this relationship with no intentions or dreams of it ever lasting. I always thought we would break up senior year. Now that senior year is a reality, I honestly can't imagine being without him. He's a part of me and as cheesy as it sounds, I actually love the fuck out of him. (take that as you'd like). We've talked about college and he has this idea that he wants us to move on (if we go to different schools) and meet new people and try out new relationships so that we know that what we have is better than anything out there. 

I'm being realistic here--people can change a lot in four years. Is it wrong for me not to want to try and work this out and try a LDR? I am sure there are a million guys out there that I could be compatible with, but that's the thing. I don't want compatibility--I want him. He has this grand idea that we will come back together after college and everything will be perfect. I know he's scared--we've never dated before our relationship and we've never known anyone else the way we know each other. I just don't want to risk what we have on a unrealistic idea. I love him, like honest to everything in life, love him. We get in fights, things aren't always perfect, but we have the same set of principles and we believe in the same things. We are from two very different cultures and I think both of us have learned a shit ton from each other.

POST: My girlfriend really likes going out, while I like staying home. I will (and have) admitted a video game addiction that I am trying to rid myself of. She says that I don't spend enough time with her, and I have been trying, and she admits to that.

I feel the reason other than video games is because I have been turned off from the relationship because I don't feel appreciated. I do all of the housework, but we both have jobs. I work at home, she works at a restaurant. I have asked repeatedly for more help with the housework, but she doesn't really do anything. She says it is because I do it all before she has a chance to, but I only do it all because I know she won't do it.

She likes hanging out with male friends, and one of them she used to have a crush on. I have told her repeatedly how uncomfortable this makes me, to no effect. She seemingly has no remorse for anything. 

I do not believe she has cheated on me. She is very honest with me and I have always trusted her, unlike past relationships. She has been better to me than past relationships, and things used to be different.

I do one other issue with this relationship, but I need to resolve how I feel about this one first.

This always upset him because he said he doesn't like traditional romance and she would berate him for it calling him a bad boyfriend and saying things like ""he must not really love her."" Besides her, he also isn't religious and doesn't want us to mingle money because he feels it would cause more arguments partially due to us having very different spending styles. All of this is fine with me (I actually earn more than he does). But I am rambling a bit. Should I just show him the ring? Should I just say fuck it and buy it for myself and ask for something less ""controversial"" or should I ask him but preface it with ""I know it's says engagement but I am not suggesting you propose."" 

Seems like a very small issue and it really isn't a big one. I just don't want to ask people I know IRL because I don't feel like getting the ""WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GET MARRIED! Why SHOULDN'T he propose???"" etc.

TL;DR:",  Found a pretty ring that I'd like for Xmas from my boyfriend but I don't want him to think I am trying to get him to propose. Should I just show him the ring or should I ask him but not?,  I saw a ring I want for Xmas that is an engagement ring but I want the ring just to have it and don't want him to think I am trying to get him to propose.

TITLE: I'm [21/f] in a 5 year relationship with [22/m], don't know how to show I'm still trying without being clingy.

POST: * I am horrible at explaining things, so I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense.

I love him, first off.
Let's get some backstory out of the way.
We met in high school, he's my first relationship, I'm not his first. We've been together for over 5 years now, we want to get married, blah blah blah.

I think he feels that I'm not trying in the relationship anymore, because we've decided we want to be together forever.
I don't know.. how to do that without being clingy.

He's had 2 friends-that-are-girls throughout our relationship that he's had crushes on. I think it's because I get jealous and I start pushing him away, so he latches onto them to fill the void. I know this is my fault. We talked about this last night. 

I'm overweight. I shower once or twice a week. Don't shave as much as I could. I'm honestly stressed out about some family/job issues happening, but I didn't realize how much I let myself go.

He told me all of this last night, and it makes sense. I made a mental decision that I was going to take care of myself. I'm going to shower regularily, shave often, dress nicely, and find time/motivation to work out.

What's really bothering me is I don't know if that's enough. He told me he wants to be with me, for the rest of his life. And I want to be with him. How do I show him I'm trying without being clingy?

I'm okay with him flirting, and hanging out with girls, but I don't want him to fall in love with someone else.

I know I'm insecure. I just... wondered if anybody has some tips for what kind of things I could do, to show that I'm trying. Because I want to try, I just don't know what to do.
I don't want to smother him, and I don't want him to think I don't care anymore.

TITLE: I [15M] am having trouble talking to my [15F] crush.

POST: I am in my last year of school before sixth form and last year my crush and I were talking quite a lot in class. It was fun, however we only sat together in one class. Now this year I don't sit next to her in any of my classes.

You may just say why don't just talk to her outside of class, but that's why I'm having trouble. At break and lunch I only see her when she's with about 3-5 of her friends and no less, because I don't know them its hard for me to go and talk to just her when shes with them.

I'd say i'm liked in school, but not popular. People think i'm a nice guy, but as I said not popular. However my crush is popular and she's always around people. They always talk to her and never really leave her alone (not in a bad way). Therefore I can't really talk to her unless she sits next to me in class or I see her on her own (which would only be a few minutes). I do go to a thing outside of school where there is a lot less people and not as many of them talk to her, but the ones that do talk constantly.

I think she thinks I'm a nice guy, but doesn't know me well enough to want to talk to me outside of class. 

So what should I do here? I don't want to let go just yet. Help is appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR:","  I like my crush, but shes popular and always around people. I can't talk to her outside of class unless shes with people.

But, despite this, I still think about one girl (21/F) in particular from high school. I had a crush on her during a difficult time in my life, and I want to move on but I can not. I've seen her in my dreams, sometimes even cheating with her there. I have not seen or talked with this girl in years either, so why is she so strong in my brain? Why is this happening?

POST: I've been with her for almost a year and a half now. Things lately due to life made us feel a little distant (more her than me) but things seem to be picking up now. 

Here's the thing, we only use condoms as our form of birth control. I'm getting more and more paranoid now about her getting pregnant to the point that I ask her to take plan B once in a while when I'm unsure of something and it's so bad that between her periods and when we aren't having sex I'm suffering anxiety over the idea of getting her pregnant somehow and having mild panic attacks over it. Especially when her irregular period gets weird like this month.

Unfortunately she's a little bit hesitant about getting on birth control. She feels like it will add more stress to her life with the symptoms, possible adverse effects and so on. I don't want to deny either of us sex but I don't think I can continue having sex with her comfortably unless she's on birth control. I don't know if I'm being all wrong about this or what.

TITLE: I'm currently messaging a girl on facebook, and I need some advice

POST: Hi reddit. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this sort of question, but I would like some sort of advice on how to go about this situation.

Long story short, I'm basically getting to know this girl that my co-worker was attempting to hook me up with. Unfortunately every time we tried to meet each other, she'd end up not going (she's incredibly shy). This was a problem since I'm now out of the country and in the middle east for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet this girl before I left, but that didn't happen. However, I knew that she was interested in meeting me, so I added her on facebook. 

Through that, we've started messaging each other and getting to know each other. She's a pretty cool chick and seems like an incredible match for me. However, it takes a while for her to reply to my messages. 

I recently got in touch with my (now ex) co-worker and she's told me that this girl has been talking about me and says that I'm interesting. But she suggests that I hold out on asking her out due to the fact that she might not be over her previous relationship and is currently only looking for a friend. But she told me to keep talking to her and to ask her out just a little bit before I get back home, which makes sense.

But I'm a bit wary, I get friend zoned a lot when it comes to women. I just have that kind of...personality that only attracts friends and not lovers :P I'm just worried on how I'm gonna keep talking to this girl on facebook and sort of....keep away from the whole friendzone deal. I'm still out of the country for at least a month, so the messaging will go on for a while. 

So reddit, what advice could you give me? How can I make myself stay away from the friendzone while chatting with this girl whom I've never actually met?

I'm not sure if I worded this whole thing out well, but if there's any questions needed for clarification, please feel free to ask :)

TITLE: My [21f] boyfriend [22m] says he's over sex. Help me understand.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating just over a month. We started having sex just before we started dating. We're in a (minor) long distance relationship at the present and while visiting him most recently, we had an argument about sex.

Prior to dating him, I was a virgin while he'd had sex with multiple girls over the years. My sex drive is pretty high and considering we only see each other for weekends at a time, we generally have sex at least once a day. However, he said he's over that. 

He got the ""sexxing"" out a couple years ago and that people in ""real relationships"" don't base their relationships on sex. What I don't understand is what this argument is trying to achieve exactly... because people in ""real relationships"" have sex too. It's making me feel like I'm not attractive enough for him to want to have sex with or that when we do have sex, it's not good enough to keep his interest. I don't think that's his intention though, so can someone please help me understand the thought process behind this is?

TITLE: TIFU by trying to use an air horn

POST: So last night, I was over at a friend's house to celebrate the New Year and had brought over an air horn that I would blast when it was midnight. I had already used the horn to scare some of my friends earlier, and was planning to use it again as a joke for when a couple of my friends finished their game of Smash Bros. Right as they finished the match, I raised it and pressed down on the button. Instead of being met with the screeching noise, however, a large PFFFFFT came out of the nozzle. A lot of the gas used in the can then came out of the sides in between the can and the actual horn, which sprayed right onto my hand. I yelled ""OH, SHIT!"" and ran to the bathroom to wash my now freezing hand and get rid of the chemicals.

TITLE: TIFU by going out on the boat

POST: Yesterday I went out for an afternoon on the water with my wife and two young boys. I pulled the boys on the tube all the way over to a swimming cove I scouted last time out (we didn't swim then because it was a cold day).

I anchored and we swam for about 20 minutes before someone came down to the shore and started yelling that we weren't allowed to anchor/swim there. They were really upset so I tried to be courteous and we left promptly.

I figured we'd get the boys back out on the tube and cruise around for a bit before heading home. However, the boat just wasn't working right... it wouldn't ever get up to speed. No matter what I tried I wouldn't go like it should.

So we abandoned the tubing and decided to head to the dock with visions of expensive repair bills dancing in my head. As we came in toward the dock I started prepping the boat (putting bumpers out, etc.). It was at this point that I realized my fuckup. Hanging from the bow cleat was my still-attached anchor rope! In my hurry to leave the swimming spot I totally forgot to pull up the anchor and been dragging the anchor all around the lake!

I sheepishly pulled up the anchor and was so flustered by my abject failure, that I made several more critical mistakes in docking and recovering the boat:
- I put the bumpers out, but then docked on the wrong side and got a few new dings in my gelcoat from the dock
- I forgot to lift the prop up all the way so it drug on the pavement as I pulled the trailer out of the water
- I parked on the edge of the parking lot while I surveyed the damage (since all the boat trailer parking spaces were full) and got an earful from the park ranger

TL;DR:","  Went out on the water with my family, forgot to pull up the anchor and dragged it all around the lake, severely damaging the boat trailer and myself.","  What started as a fun day on the water turned into a comedy of errors, with each fuckup causing a lack of concentration that lead to the next."

TITLE: Me[18M/F] with my ___ [18M/F] duration, short-description

POST: My SO and I are both 23 and we've been together for almost a year and a half now. He's rather introverted and private, and I try to respect this. We barely have any pictures together on Facebook, we're not listed as being in a relationship, and he's never made any sort of grand romantic gesture proclaiming his love for me. This is fine. I understand that different people express their emotions differently, and that the big shiny cheesy things belong more to romance movies than reality. 

The problem is that my SO used to be different. He dated a girl from 17 to 19 and seemed to be effusively vocal about his love for her. There are pictures of them smilingly posing for the camera, pictures of them cuddling and kissing, pictures of him holding up signs on top of mountains and writing elaborate messages in the snow about how much he loves her. He talked about how much he wanted her, how much he needed her, how he would always love her... all in a public forum that I can still see. They're still friends too, so it's not really as if she's strictly a part of his past. 

I do trust him, and I believe him when he says he loves me. I understand that people change over time. I understand that, at the end of the day, what matters much more is how someone treats you on a daily basis. He's not completely unromantic either. We celebrate things like Valentine's Day and birthdays, he tells me that he loves me often, and he treats me kindly. But it seems that the passion and spontaneity he displayed in his relationship with her is completely gone now. I can't tell whether that's just a consequence of maturing, or if it simply means that he doesn't love me as much as he could love someone. I would appreciate your thoughts.

We stopped our 'actions' because he decided to become more dedicated to his LDR girlfriend, who he's been off and on with since December of last year. He was confused (aka, young and doesn't know what he wants) while we were together, but I helped him understand that he really did want this girl. I had listened for DAYS about his absolute love and devotion and about how this girl saved him and how sweet she was and....blah blah blah.

Anyhow, he was supposed to be staying celibate for this girl until November, which is when he is moving back to be with her. It took all of about a week for him to go to a party and sleep with someone else (last night). I'm friends with his girlfriend, she called the house four times last night and this morning, and I had no idea what to say. I'm an honest and very open person; I won't lie if it doesn't mean life or death, but I kept his partying on the down-low.

I have no idea what to do. He does this constantly. It's a cycle, I guess. He controls what she does via telephone, but does his own thing anyway. I've talked to him, it lasts for a day or so, and he's back to treating this girl like dirt.

TITLE: I [22 M] don't understand the importance of trust in my relationship with bf of one year[27 M]

POST: this applies to my current 1 year relationship with my bf but is more of a general question. I always hear over and over how lack of trust is the #1 dealbreaker in so many relationships, but I honestly feel like being reserved or holding back is just a smart move for alot of reasons. If for example my bf is out for the night and not responding to texts that's ok and I'm not going to interrogate him or go through his texts when I see him, I just mean in a more general sense, as in I feel being reserved and protecting myself/not trusting him all the way is just the right thing to do generally. I have felt this way in all relationships I've ever had and I see no reason to change really. You never really know someone's true thoughts or feelings, and if you open up you are just going to get hurt, so why not enjoy your relationship while also protecting yourself on some level. He (or anybody else) will never have me completely but I don't think our relationship suffers for it.

Can anyone explain why this is so important to many people? I am not a sociopath I swear, just cautious and I don't see why I should change, but it is a problem to other people I have dated. I feel you can enjoy relationships and love without a deep level of trust and it's not as important to me as it is to others.

ETA many are reacting negatively which is what I expected/is unsurprising, I already know people get upset about this. Can someone explain to me WHY this is important? I don't want to hurt anyone by being this way, it's just how I feel

POST: Good day r/Loseit! First post, I had contemplated posting my journey prior to this but I got caught up with other things and didn't see at as entirely necessary but now that I made my previous milestone I am looking for advice/help/suggestions for the future.

I started Jan 1st at a weight of 286 lbs and being in the Military I had to get my act together...or else! I shook my head at myself in the mirror and got to it. I started small and slow, running short distances at slow speed, rode the bike and eliptical for lower impact exercise. I'm now up to a consistent mid-8 mile split when I do my daily three mile and that feels good. Long story short, lost 32 lbs by the time I had my Physical Fitness weigh in and cut a considerable amount from the mid section. Wearing a belt I hadn't been able to fit since Senior yr in college, granted it's on the last hole... but the one I had been wearing is on the opposite end of the spectrum so I'll take a win where I can get one. 286 to 254 in roughly 3 1/2 months. Lost roughly 4- 4 1/2 on the waist.

My issue now. Since that milestone I've sort of lost my willpower. I haven't stopped running altogether but nowhere near what I was doing prior to the weigh in. Put on about 4-6 lbs but it's holding steady... which is great considering the amount of crap has made it's weight into my diet again. My next goal is to lose around another 25-30 prior to early August for my friends wedding and ultimately I'd like to finish the yr at around 225-230 and about 15%. I'm around 260 and about 21% right now and would like help getting motivated again as well as healthy ways to lean out and lose weight the correct way.

TITLE: Hey reddit, please help me get my dad self sufficient...

POST: Ok, so here it goes, my dad (60 years old) has worked a great many years as a floor layer (his entire life basically). Hasn't worked much in the past 5, as his body has basically given out on him.

Right now, he's living in Toronto on welfare basically, but he really *wants* to work. But no one will hire him. He has a lot going against him:

* 60 years old
* Criminal Record for Assault - hit a guys truck with a shovel while he was in it (in the process of pardoning, apparently it takes 3 years)
* No drivers license
* No decent job references (spent whole life contracting, and burnt way too many bridges)
* Has family in Toronto, but he gets along with very few of them
* He is quick to anger. He was a great dad, but he never got along well with others who piss him off, which leads us into...
* Hung out with a lot of shitty people through his life, the type who screw you over when they get the chance. So very few friends :(

Basically I don't know what to suggest for him. Where can he get work? He can't lay floors, too old to function. He can;t do anything customer facing, due to assault record. He doesn't have any office skills.

Please reddit, I'll take any suggestions anyone has.

One last point, he is needing to get both knees replaced this year at some point. So aside from being down for about 12 weeks, he probably can't do a job where he has to stand the entire day.

TL;DR:","  60 year old dad on welfare, wants to work but no one will hire him. Has criminal record and no office skills. Need suggestions on how to get him self-sufficient.","  Father is unemployed, but wants to work, badly. But he has a LOT going against him. What can I do? "

TITLE: Me [30 M] went out with [29 F], but it seems like she's not as interested now

POST: I'm a 30 year old guy that has been largely out of the dating scene for a while now. Was married, got divorced, had a long term long distance relationship that ended two times because she cheated on me with her ex. I recently moved, and have been using online dating to no avail since I got here until this last week. Met a girl on a dating site, we hit it off I thought, talked for about a week before going out to dinner the other night. I thought that things went really well, we talked for hours, kissed goodnight, and all that good stuff. She said she had a really good time and wanted to go out with me again

That was Wednesday night, since then she's seemed distant when we've texted, and we haven't talked very much at all. She's shown some interest in going out again, but isn't feeling well today so didn't want to go out later on tonight. Then she's busy all day tomorrow and on Monday as well. 

I really like her, but I'm not sure how to take all of this. It's certainly plausible that she's simply been busy with work and her life and hasn't had time to talk to me. But after having been burned previously, having girls show interest and then disappear, along with having been cheated on multiple times, I guess I'm wary at this point. I'm just trying to take things as they come and not read too much into anything, but I'm finding it hard not to freak out at least a little bit. 

I'm not even really sure what it is that I'm looking for in posting this, if anything at all. I definitely don't want to come across as clingy or desperate, so I'm just waiting for her to contact me at this point. Feel free to tell me that I'm insane and overthinking things, just be honest. Like I said, I've been out of this for so long that I don't really know how I should proceed.

TL;DR:","  Went out with girl, things seemed to go well, but she's been very busy lately and seems distant when we talk. Not sure what to make of it.","  Went out with a girl the other night, thought it went well, but now it feels like she's sending some mixed signals."

POST: I just wanted to ask reddit their opinion on this:

Short story is my cousin was caught by my aunt beating and kicking her son (13) to near death in a drunken rage. Authorities showed up, got another call, and didn't come back until 3 days later. Her son (13) and daughter (12) have given MULTIPLE never-ending stories of very graphic child abuse, drug-use, and molestation while in the care of their mother.
She has been finally found (after 3 years since the incident of her being caught) to have her parental rights completely removed and the children are now under my aunt & uncle's care.

Now that the judge has found her to be an unfit parent, why is she not in jail for all of the accounts of abuse, drug-use, and molestation by her roommates?

TITLE: I [23M] want to buy important jewelry (Greek Lavalier) for my girlfriend [22F]. We've been dating a year and I can't afford it because of her metal allergy.

POST: Hi, this is my first post to /r/Relationships!

I have been dating my current girlfriend, who I met in college, for just over a year now. We have fortunately had a very strong relationship with few fights. To add a little background, I am a member of a fraternity in college, and I am graduating this semester. I understand this is a controversial topic, but please see me through. A tradition of greek life is to buy a girl who means a lot to you a ""lavaliere"", a piece of jewelry containing the greek letters. However, I am unable to completely afford this before I graduate. I have elected to buy her the necklace chain that this charm will go on.

However, she has a metal allergy, which I have not had completely explained by her. From what I know, she is able to tolerate gold jewelry, but not gold plated jewelry.  I don't want to ask her because I'd prefer to surprise her.

What I am asking is, does anyone in this sub have any familiarity with this issue, and if so, what karat of gold is reasonable? Must I buy the most pure gold (24K, right)? Or can I skate by on lesser quality? I want to purchase this before I graduate in the next couple weeks.

TITLE: The love of my life, please give me advice

POST: I dated a man starting three and a half years ago when we met at university. He's incredibly smart, handsome, funny, and we really get along swimmingly. However, it became increasingly clear that he was serious that he never wanted to get married and I hate long distance relationships (I have needs that can't be met, primarily intimacy and emotional connection) so we amicably broke it off when I graduated about two years ago. 

After about four months apart he came to me and said he loved me so much he wanted to make it work. I was extremely reticent but finally consented, because our relationship did show great promise except for the marriage issue and the long distance issue. He had one quarter left and I assumed he'd finish up and get a job near me. He finishes up and for two or three months searches non stop. Gets a few offers, and finally accepts one back in our university town. I consented but said you have six months to a year to search rigorously and find a job here with me or I'm leaving. Our relationship experienced a downward spiral of anger and sadness because he wasn't following through. Finally after a few attempts I just broke it off because the constant depression that his failure to follow through put me in was killing me.

I never told him I still loved him at the end (I did indeed love him before but purposefully began distancing myself to try and protect myself from the seemingly eventual demise of our relationship) and just said he was wonderful and I wished he'd made the choices he said he would. I'm in denial almost about what has happened. I keep expecting him to do some grand gesture and try to win me back. 

Is this it you think? Should I tell him I love so he knows just in case? I'm at a loss because I honestly could see us being together forever and am so confused as to why he said he loved me so much but didn't make that commitment. Maybe he isn't ready or I'm not the right woman, but then why didn't he leave me alone a year and a half ago? Why put me through all this suffering?

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend of three and a half years never followed through on his commitment to me and I ended things amicably. Still love him but confused as to why he didn't. Should I tell him I still love him?,  I was with the man I thought I could marry but I had to leave him because being in a long distance relationship with seemingly no end was killing me.

TITLE: Will working for a ""faith-based"" company hurt me later?

POST: I'm moving to the bible belt for the first time in my life in a few months due to my husband's job relocation (Nashville in fact), leaving my current full-time job to do so. 

I've been sending out applications for about a month to see if I can secure a job before moving. So far I have run across many positions and companies that call themselves ""faith-based"" or promote products such as Christian books or movies, probably 50% or the open positions I qualify for. I'm wondering if working for such a company would pigeon-hole me in the future. The rest of my background experience is quite varied at the moment, but it is mostly internships and one entry-level job since I graduated college recently. I likely won't be at this job for more than 3 years (my husband's job will move us once more) so I want to make sure I remain marketable. 

For the record I'm an atheist and I work in the public relations/communications field.

TITLE: BF of almost a year is super indifferent about sex -- I'm not.  Help me, Reddit, you're my only hope.

POST: We're both 18 and in college, and it's an LDR.  I think, in general, our relationship is going really well, especially considering the distance.  We started getting into the sexual stuff around the...3 or 4 month mark, when I went down on him. Every other time after that for a couple months, when I asked, he didn't seem to want to ""go there"" again, but after a talk, we straightened it out and started doing that stuff pretty regularly.

So before we left for college, I asked him if he wanted to have sex. Both of us were virgins. He seemed blasé about it, but we ended up doing it once anyway.  Every other time after that, when I asked, he said he didn't really want to, which made me a little insecure and worried that something was wrong, so I asked him about it and he just said that he's never really cared all that much about having sex and that it's kind of a chore, etc etc. Eventually we ended up having sex one other time, but when I asked if he liked it any better, he said it was the same.

I really don't understand how he can be so indifferent about it, but seem to enjoy our other sexual exploits.  I've talked to him about this a couple of times, but I don't really want to keep bothering him about it; I just really want to understand what he's thinking.  I enjoyed sex (though I didn't think it was the greatest thing in the world, it was still fun because it was with him) and I would potentially like to do it more often with him...I love him a lot, and I don't want this issue to screw up our relationship.  Help me understand what is going on inside his head!

TITLE: How do I [F 20] deal with my boyfriend [M 19] constantly playing computer games and nothing else, feeling second best

POST: I've been with my boyfriend now for 6 years. We met in high school and are now living together in the flat we own while we're at university. 

Ever since we moved in together 2 years ago all I've felt is second best to his beloved computer and computer games. He's studying computer games at uni so I completely understand how he feels about them and have absolutely no problem with that, I don't want to stop him doing what he loves and what he wants to make a career out of.

However, it feels as if the only 'proper' time we spend together these days is at breakfast and dinner while we're eating. The usual daily routine is breakfast > uni > dinner > he'll sit on his computer all night! I'll be sat alone looking for something to do > bed.

I've tried explaining how I feel to him, but he always sees it as me starting an argument. He says he understands and will stop being on his PC as much, but nothing changes each time I tell him how I feel.

How do I stop feeling second best and taken for granted? I don't want us to spend every waking minute together, but an hour a day eating with barely no conversation is not the relationship I want to be in. I've told him i want to take a break and leave which he takes as a joke, and anyway, I dont want to give up on the last 6 years so easily.

So yeah, any advice as to how I could possibly get him to listen more and maybe not take what I'm saying as a joke would be great.

POST: Around 23, I shared a ranch style duplex, attached only by the garages with a 30-something couple. (small 2-bedrooms, but both had a separated LARGE yard.)  I step out for a cig and told my neighbor (who was just finishing mowing his yard) I wanted to see 'George Clinton & the P-Funk' in the mountains, but I only had enough money for gas up there, or the ticket in... I might as well mow my lawn too.  

I thought nothing of it, but five minutes later, he knocks on my door and tells me... ""Here is twenty dollars, have a good time at the show.""  I tried to tell him it was too much, but he talked me into it, mostly on my promise to pay him back the money when I got paid. Anyways, I got into the show and even snuck in a half-pint of cheap whiskey to mix with free waters. (Yes, people gave me weird looks, when I went into the port-a-potty with clean water and came out with a ""yellowish"" water cup.) I met some good people, got hit on by a variety of cougars, and made it home safely the next morning. When I got home, I noticed my neighbor also mowed my entire lawn while I was at the show. (At least an hour hard work.)

Yesterday I had them both over at my house and we were just having a nice day relaxing, enjoying the weather and we went swimming in my pool. Everything was really awesome, but at one point I left to use the restroom. When I came back I felt an awkwardness to the situation but I wasn't sure why until later. 

After my friend left my girlfriend told me that while I was gone that he started asking about her nipple piercings, which she said wasn't weird itself but she thought it was odd that he brought it up while I wasn't there. Apparently he then proceeded to ask her to 'show them to him' and when she said that would be weird he said ""you can't just get nipple piercings and not show people, that's a waste.""

My girlfriend said that it wasn't a big deal to her because she thinks he was joking, but I feel like the fact that she brought it up to me said a lot and she seemed upset by it. Even if she doesn't think it's a big deal, I do. I just don't really know what to do from here. 

Should I call him out? Am I overreacting or is that really creepy for a guy to do, especially to his best friend's girl? I don't really want to lose him over this but I feel like she won't be comfortable around him anymore and he's not worth that.

POST: Background:  Wife and I have been married for 4 years.  We keep our income separate and have separate bank accounts.  We make about equal money and try to split bills evenly.  I pay for the mortgage and car, she pays for daycare and phones, etc.  We only use debit cards, no credit cards.

My wife recently took out a ""reserve line of credit"" (her words) from her bank.  We typically only ever use debit cards but she was short one month due to a $600+ bill and I guess her checking account has an option to take out the money easily.  It wasn't a whole lot of money but since it's basically a credit card the interest is bad ($1,000 at 12% interest).

I'm more mad that she didn't tell me than I am that she took out the money.  It isn't the first time that it's happened, but we've since paid off the credit from the previous time she did it.  It seems wrong to me that she could take out debt that I could potentially be liable for.  I don't like the idea of having debt that I am completely unaware of.

POST: The Starbucks crowd can act really entitled, but there's no one worse than this 60+ year old regular.  Let's call him Bill.

Bill and I like sitting in the same corner.  I don't know why he does, but I do because it has space for me to put my stuff where it's out of everyone's way and not taking up a chair - it allows me to be considerate.  When I get to Starbucks first, I sit there.  Bill was so openly aggressive about it that I finally just sat somewhere else until he left and switched seats.

But an asshole is still an asshole, and he'd be aggressive towards me no matter where I sat.  Not to mention, I come everyday and he doesn't, so there are days I'm trying to be considerate and ultimately end up losing out on the seat I like to a third party.  But whatever, it's a seat - I don't own seats in Starbucks and I'm not going to make a fuss about it because I'm a grown up.

Well, after Bill didn't show up two days this week, I decided I'm not waiting for him to have his seat, and he can grow up about it.  He is about 40 years my senior, and there's no reason I should be more mature than him - girls don't mature *that* much faster than boys.  Today I was ordering a bagel - yes, I order as cheap as I can when I'm here - and he saw me and called me a bitch.  And he always throws comments my way, but that was unfairly harsh.  I have done nothing to him other than like the same damn seat and finally had enough of letting him dictate my sitting habits.

I'm starting to bet Bill was raised as an only child and never had kids of his own, because he has 0 signs of maturity despite how old he is.  High road or low, he bitches at me for existing, and I'm not letting him drive me away.

Sorry for the rant, but seriously - how do people get to be that old and have the maturity of a two-year-old?

Plus she said she's happy with him, and has no way of knowing if she'd be happier with me so its best to just let things run their course naturally. The night ended with us looking at the skyline on the beach, and it was bad. Like we didn't do anything at all, but the tension was too thick so we left.  So now we're in this odd pseudo relationship where we're trying to be friends, and we both agree it would go well for nobody if anything ever happened, but it is a fucking pain in the ass. 

I know I'm under her thumb, but I told her we were ""breaking up"" last night at the beach and that we weren't gonna do this anymore. I know she doesn't mean to lean on me emotionally, its mostly my fault because I haven't had a relationship in about 10 years and I welcomed the company and I can honestly say at worst she's just ignorant of what she's doing. But hot damn, why did one of the hottest girls I've ever met have to do this.

TL;DR:",  Me and friend fucked up our friendship last night by casually discussing that she doesn't want to marry current BF and that she feels shitty for rushing into rebound relationship without being sure it was what she wanted. Now in pseudo relationship.,"  Discussed the emotional cheating nature of relationship and broke it off before it started. How do I stay friends, and feel better about this at the same time?"

TITLE: My boyfriend [9+ months] is a bad gift giver. Help! [16f and 17m]

POST: Throwaway because my boyfriend is an active redditor. 

I've been dating my boyfriend, 'Tyler', for around 9 months. For each holiday/anniversary that has come up, I have thought long and hard and gotten him many expensive, thought-consuming gifts.

Christmas, Valentines Day, his birthday, and our 6 month anniversary are all things I have spent a lot of time and money making special. I do not have a job so personal income is hard to get, but I have spent $50-$75 each holiday, along with hours of careful planning and gift making. In response, I get a cheap, inpersonal gift, or worse..the promise of a gift. 

It may seem petty or bratty, but I take gift-giving very seriously. I have several components for each gift, and each one takes a long time to do. It upsets me that he has gotten his parents to buy me gifts averaging at around $10 tops.

He has a job and a steady income, as well as a car. He tends to use those things as excuses. I do not have either of those things, but I still manage to get him something nice.

I don't know how I should talk to him and get my point across without feeling bad.

TITLE: [20, M]y sister [17] is dating a friend of my father [26]

POST: Last week my sister came home after going to her friends way too late. I asked about it, and she went to this guy who is a friend of my father. We also know him a little, and he is a good guy, not someone who would abuse her. She didn't tell my parents, though, but my father suspected something.
By the time I'm writing this the following has happened:
She went to him twice, lying to my parents where she went.
I talked to her, and she says she is in love with him. And vice versa.
She also said they were going to tell my father some day.
I told my sister I wasn't sure a relationship with him would be a good idea, because of the age difference.

Now, are my concerns merely social stigma, or should I do something? Should I tell my father, should I tell my sister she should stop seeing him because it's not right?

TITLE: TIFU by not using my own clean glass.

POST: This happened last year, but I feel as though I effed up so hard I should share it with fellow effer uppers. 

My husband and I work opposite shifts during the week. He leaves for work at 4:30am and gets home around 2:30-3, and I leave for work at 10:30am and get home around 8:30. He usually is in bed before or shortly after I get home and has already eaten dinner/lounged around a bit. He'll get tired and sometimes leave his cup or plate from dinner out on the coffee table. 

We don't have a dishwasher so sometimes I will just reuse his cup if we are drinking the same thing. This period of time we were on a cranberry-grape juice kick. I came home from work and made some food, and refilled the cup he had used as it had about an inch  of juice left in it. I finish eating and start chugging the juice and I have a teeny tiny amount left when I notice something floating around and flowing up toward my mouth as I drink. 

What the hell? What is that? Oh, just my husband's TRIMMED TOENAILS.

I drank a whole cup of dark grape juice that camouflaged anything in it until the very end. There in the bottom of the damned cup were little off white crescents of clipped toenails. I usually ask him to please not throw them on the floor because stepping on them is sick, but what the shit. I'd rather step on them than have my drink flavored with sweaty warehouse worker toe clippings. GAGBARFVOMIT!! I seriously cried a little and then told my best friend who still likes to remind me of the incident.

TL;DR:","  Didn't use my own clean glass when drinking grape juice, ended up having a small amount of clipped toenails floating around in the bottom of the cup.",  Always check cups before you fill them. Or just use a clean one because washing a cup is not that hard. Today you learned.

POST: I've a huge crush on this one girl who is way out of my league.

We've met maybe twice last year, talked on facebook quite a bit, but she had a boyfriend, so I kind of abandoned all hope. 

This year, however, we went to a concert together in March, and she broke the news to me that they aren't together anymore. We've met once again a month ago, and spent almost the whole day together. Nothing intimate has come out of it. These were the only few successful attempts to meet with her-there were plenty invitations that she dismissed (although mostly for legitimate reasons.)

So, here's where I decided to try a little ploy: I purposefully put myself in a position where I needed her specific skills to get me out of it. And she did help me out a few times, at first. But then I got too needy, and she outright refused to help me. Now, I don't know what to do. I think of giving her a present, as a token of gratitude for the help, and finally make my intentions clear.

The thing is, we got in a pretty bad argument the other day, regarding going out with some friends. Long story short, I ended up telling him to go away, he packed his stuff. He never left, and we talked it out, but I feel like since that's happened we both have been feeling weird. I feel nervous all the time, and I feel like he is questioning whether or not he even wants to be in this relationship. I have tried to talk to him about it, and he says he's not going to leave, but he's been super quiet, and just different around me lately. We don't joke as much, laugh, and he just looks miserable.

TITLE: Not even enough physical attraction to enjoy kissing my (m24) girlfriend (f23.)

POST: We have been together for three years now, and I can not think of a time that I have ever been actually physically attracted to my girlfriend.  I love her to death, the thought of not being with her makes me feel ill to my stomach; yet I cannot even enjoy sex, kissing, or anything actually intimate with her.

Aside from the lack of physical attraction, we do enjoy each other's company. She takes great care of me, heeding to my needs and I heed to hers as well. Our personalities are quite different, I am an introvert and can go a long time without doing social events. She, however, is a strong extrovert and constantly needs to be doing something different. We've recently had arguments about me needing to be doing more activities with her, other than going to the movies, hanging out at the house, and going to the bars with our friends.

To give it a short summary. I am not physically attracted to her, our personalities differ completely, and I do not feel fully committed to our relationship like she is. I feel like I am doing her an injustice by keeping her from finding a guy that likes to do all the activities that she does. And more over, a guy that will put more of his own love into the relationship.

TITLE: Tip: When in doubt, just ask.

POST: Short story time. 

I made a goof recently with paying my credit card bill. I always pay in full the week prior to it being due. I don't do auto pay for this card because often times I have things being refunded back to it or credited to it and would rather calculate how much I need to pay to hit $0 balance myself. Whereas with auto pay it would likely overpay and I would have account credits. Not a big deal, but something that bothers me.

Anyways. I was going out for the weekend. So I quickly jumped on, figured out what I needed and hit pay, got up and ran out the door without even looking back. Didn't check my email for confirmation and overall just screwed up.

Today I got an email from my creditor (Chase) saying that I was late in paying and was hit with a $25 Late fee. Obviously I was distraught. 

I immediately got in contact with them and asked if there was an off chance that since I have never been late before and use this card a lot if they could waive the late fee and interest charges I would likely incur. Without hesitation they said ""No Problem"". They credited me the late fee and are waiving interest for 2 months. 

Needless to say, I was relieved. Even though it wasn't a lot of money, it was stressful. I haven't paid interest in nearly a year and dread the thought of ever doing so again.

TITLE: [m23] Me and the last girl I had really a connection to [f23] broke up nearly 2 years ago and I've been having the urge break a year and a half of silence after so long. How should I proceed?

POST: First off, it'd be nice to mention that me and this girl dated for 5 years, from we were 16 to 21; through most of high school and college. Like any relationship, we had highs and lows brought on by both of us which always became passive aggressive.

After one mistaken night, she felt I had taken advantage of her(however, I hadn't), broke up with me, and then proceeded to call me every name in the book to our social circle(abuser, manipulator, cheater, rapist, etc; all things which never happened). So we break up and neither of us take it well and we keep a thin line of communication which eventually breaks down. I start seeing somebody new and I presume she does too but I couldn't say for sure. 

Around this time, I find out she's been stalking me through a web service to monitor traffic for a personal blog that I host. It's obsessive, she checked it multiple times a day, even hundreds of times a month. At some point, she finally slows down on it months later, noticeably when she finds out me and a fling stopped seeing one another.

The kicker ends up being that I've still thought about this girl I dated for 5 years everyday since we've broken up. I want to reach out to her but we had such a toxic thing in the past but I know I've grown as person a long time since but I don't know what good it'd do breaking this near 2 years of silence. I don't have an endgame really; more than anything, I just want to hear from her and see how she's been particularly since she appears to be doing well, however I don't want to adversely affect her and cause more drama and emotional strife.

TITLE: Weird situation here... I'm trying to help out my friend and just need Reddit's opinion

POST: Hey Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me out with this one.  
So, here's the story so far: I'm friends with a girl (she is a good friend of my girlfriend) who, from my point of view, is a bit in a rough spot right now. She is 28, came out of a rather long, serious relationship (that lasted for about 8 years) a couple of years ago and hasn't had anything serious going for her ever since (apart from the occasional fuck).
  
So, about three weeks ago, she met this guy, who seemed like a regular bloke at first. They are both in their late 20s. So as things go, they started seeing each other quite often. She would sleep over at his place and he, in turns, would sleep over at hers.  
There is just one problem though: no fucking.  

You might say that this is not a problem as such, but you see, things are a bit weird. My friend has tried her best to initiate any kind of affectionate interaction. The closest was her grabbing his dick. He just laughed in return, said that he is a little bit tired and then they proceeded to hug each other and fall asleep (oh yeah they did make out once but did not proceed to sexual intercourse, since this bloke used the same excuse to ""get out of it"")  
So, despite them seeing each other every day, despite clear initiatives coming from her side, nothing has happened yet. Weirder yet, my friend has totally fallen for this guy. The bloke doesn't seem to show clear signs of affection. But why would he then continue to see her every other day? Am I just over-analyzing stuff? Its weird, it seems to me that this guy is actually afraid of sex or something of that sort...

TL;DR:","  My friend is seeing a guy who doesn't show any signs of affection. Despite clear intentions from both parties, nothing has happened yet. Am I over-analyzing things?","  Friend is seeing a guy who absolutely (nonverbally) refuses to fuck her, despite clear initiative coming from the girls side.

TITLE: Why do men not back down after a girl states she is not interested?

POST: Last night I was at the bar shooting pool, a Latin American man in his late-forties or early-fifties complimented me on a shot I had made by shaking my hand and giving me a kiss on the cheek. As a new pool player, and a few drinks deep, I deemed this to be a kind gesture, said thank you and continued on with my game.

Later in the evening he approached me while I was waiting for the single bathroom to open up. He tried kissing me, I nicely told him I was not interested and in order to avoid what was turning into an awkward situation, held a conversation until the bathroom door opened up. After I left the bathroom, he was still in the hallway, called me beautiful, and I said something along the lines of ""That's sweet.  Have a good night"" and went back to meet up with my friends. 

Over the course of the night, there were 3 more interactions with this man similar to the one outside the bathroom. After the last time I decided to leave the bar since he was not getting the hint and was making me extremely uncomfortable. 

I can't explain how many times this happens to me. I'm a relatively attractive girl in my early 20s and am not a ""bitch."" In other words, I don't like rudely telling a guy I'm not interested, nor do I feel like I should have to. I feel like it should be sufficient for me state that I'm not interested politely and that be it. 

so I'd really like to know why men tend to do this to women?? and is possible for me to turn down a guy nicely and not have the reoccurring, borderline harassing, attempts to be ""picked up""?

TITLE: My girlfriend [20F] of eight months equates porn to infidelity, catches me [M24] watching it.

POST: Hello,

When we first got together, my sweet and lovely girlfriend told me loud and clear that she equated watching porn to infidelity and that she would break up with me if she ever caught me doing it.

I admit straight away that I outright dismissed her message and continued watching porn on occasion; never when she was around and never on the expense of our sex life but behind her back and I often felt a twinge of shame. Yet, I kept on doing it.

It had to happen eventually. She discovered it yesterday and she has been devastated since then, sobbing uncontrollably for long bouts of time. Yet, she has also been kind, telling me how much she loves me and asking me rather than others for consolation (which I must say I feel very awkward about).

Immediately after the revelation, I owned up, offering her to break up with me because I realized what a let-down I had been. She turned it down, saying that she would stay with me, but it will be over if I ever watch pornography again. Nor can I break up with her, seeing that she has personal issues where my support is extremely precious to her. Walking away could destroy her.

There's not much more to say. She and I go along together extremely well and I have to count myself lucky that she still wants to stay with me and I will have to work hard to win back her trust. Although I do think her equation between porn and infidelity is forced, I absolutely disregarded her warning and now I am paying the price. Still, I feel wretched, branded an adulterer and I fear that our future relationship will be entirely on her mercy. 

There has been an incredible amount of anger and loathing over these past few days, but I now see that it is my responsibility to set things right. Still, should I just be completely meek in doing so or should I assert that, although I betrayed her trust, I haven't exactly killed anyone? 

I just want to hear your take. Is there something I have overlooked?

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend equates watching porn to infidelity and caught me watching it yesterday. She has been devastated since and I feel awful. Should I assert that I haven't betrayed her trust or should I just be meek?,  Girlfriend equated porn to infidelity; I watched it anyway. Now I am essentially an adulterer.

So I left. Granted I see and take care of my children every day. That is not the issue here, the issue is coming. 

So things are hard. We're looking at one another and feeling the pain of the separation. We stick around one another to do family things and keep the kids happy. Then we start having sex again two months in but we still stay apart. 

On the side she begins hitting up craigslist for men and women and gets hits. She'll go to work and on her lunch she'll fuck someone in the car and then never see them again. 

This devastated me at first. I couldn't believe that she would beg me to come back, fuck me, and then have something on the side. But then I realized I had something on the side. So it go weird for a while and we didn't talk again. 

Now we're talking and having sex again, but now I make her tell me, as we are fucking what she did with those other men. And it is the best sex ever. Now we're thinking of letting her get fucked by other men and let me watch.

It's gotten to the point where we had to talk about seeing each other more because she wants to see me more but with the LSATs coming up, I just can't go out as much and it's really hard for both of us. She understands what I'm going through, but at the same time, since she's still in college, she says that she can't understand from experience and I really feel like this is why my relationship feels extremely strained right now. I'm even considering going on a break for a month in September since I'm basically going to just study and just telling her she can do whatever she wants and just not tell me about any guys, but then I thought about how that would just be another thing for me to worry about.

Anyone go through this and have some advice at what I can do to make her happy while I'm preoccupied with this test?

TITLE: My [17 F] friend is dating a [46 M], help!

POST: I think the title says it all, but I figure I should give some background all the same. I met this girl when I was 17 and she was 13, and we developed a sort of big sister/little sister relationship. She was badly abused as a child, absentee father, but also incredibly bright and precocious. We spent a lot of time talking activism, debate (we were both on the team in our high school) and her life in high school while I was a couple hours away at college. 

Over the last year or so we've drifted, but I've reconnected with her a bit as I'm back in my hometown for the summer. She mentioned that she'd been seeing someone new, but I didn't have a chance to ask her too much. We both follow each other on tumblr, and the other day she posted a very explicit paragraph about going to her 'boyfriend's' house, where they'd had sex for a long time and hung out. His age (46) is on there. Naturally my big sister instincts kicked in right away, but I have no idea how to approach the issue. The kicker is this: in our state, the age of consent _is_ 17. 

Ultimately, I don't know if I'm going to be shut down for this. Can anything be done? Even if it's technically legal, it seems so predatory I'd feel complicit if I did nothing. Thanks everyone for your time!

TITLE: 3 and a half year relationship on brink of disaster.

POST: Hey everyone, first poster here, but coming to you as its the only place that I know that can help me really, so on with the show.

I am male and in a 3 and a half year relationship with a female, we are both 19 seperated by a couple of moths,, and currently living in uni. We live in seperate flats at the moment, but beofr this we virtually lived in the same flat (1 room with a bathroom), I know this probably didnt help the situation.

Our relationship has had some problems in the past with her being paranoid about other people, and that lasted about 6 months before finally everything was sorted out through the help of a counsiler and self help books. We were ok for a while, spendng a lot of time together and everything going fine, until recently things took a down turn.

I have become the slightest bit paranoid with male friends, because it seems that suddendll her only outlook is towards friends, with her only ever talking about friends, and always seemingly to be on her phone. Our relationship is neglected, we barley spend ""quality"" time with each other (activities, films, ect.) and sex is completely out of the window, being 1-2 months bewteen it. I have moved back out into my own flat by a joint choice, as we feel the room apart will help us become us again. We do talk about it and she feels like she has done wrong in the relationship not being able to forgive her self with the paranoia at the start of our relations, or how she shouts and swears during conversations and discussions.

As well as this her familty has had a few problems, with only yesterday her dad having a heart attack, and her mum finding out he cheater on her a few months ago.

So here is the question /r/, how would i go about fixing this relationship and are we on the right lines to doing this?

TL;DR:","  3 and a half year relationship on the verge of disaster, relationship neglected, her paranoia and swearing has caused strain on the relationship, how can i fix it and are we on the right lines to doing this?","  relationship has paranoia, gf not forgiving herself about small petty things in the relationship, we have spent to much time together and are arguing, how would we go about fixing it?"

TITLE: I'm considering switching my major from English Education to Music Industry

POST: My University is small, so the Music Industry major is simply a combination of a Music Business and Music Technology. I'm a Sophomore (36 Credits) and I still have a little bit of time to change my schedule before the summer ends. I've been thinking about changing my major from English Education to Music Industry essentially since I discovered that that was a major. I've always had a passion for working with people younger than me and for reading and writing and general English things, and to be quite honest, I'm very good at it - to the point where those classes are too easy for me. However, my main reason for truly becoming a teacher is because I've never had a good English teacher, and I want to put more good English teachers into the world. But then I joined a Music Fraternity; and on my campus, my Fraternity is in charge of all things Sound related - at least Technology-wise. And we essentially ""run"" two out of three variety shows a year, and while I was working these I found myself absolutely mesmorized by working sound and running wires and equipment and everything else. I especially enjoyed the seemingly mind-numbing task of running XLRs along the stage, simply because I didn't really have the know-how to do anything else. But honestly I was so interested in learning more and I just had such a good time running these shows that I'm worried about how much I'd actually enjoy teaching.

If it helps, I worked out a three-year plan, and I'll graduate on time - assuming I take the Business courses (about four of them) and my Internship (Four Credits) over next Summer. 

So essentially, what should I do? Should I change majors? Or should I stay in my English major?

TITLE: I [23 F] dont know if a friend [24 M] is worth the effort anymore?

POST: I have a ""friend"" who has always mistreated me. He constantly pointed out my flaws, mocked me when others complimented me, and just generally has not provided a supportive friendship. I have always tolerated his actions, mostly because I feel as though this was his socially awkward way of developing some sort of friendship with me. He supposedly has been like this with many other people, but only to me in our current friends circle.

I, on the hand, think I have put a lot of effort in being nice back to him despite everything. I have tolerated his unnecessarily mean comments (though I now and then mention that I think he is mean to me), hoping that our friendship would develop into a better one over time. There are some times now and then when he and I get along very well, but it returns to the usual in the couple days.

I thought that our friendship was improving a lot, however recently he acted in a way that I found very insulting. I felt as though he had not respected me as a person and, to an extent, used me. To be honest, I am now unsure of whether he ever valued me as a friend like I thought of him. 

This friendship has a taken a lot out of me over a long time, and now I am uncertain whether I should just give up and kick him out of my life or try to mend it and keep going. I am pretty sure he knows that I have been acting differently (trying to stay away from him), but I also know that he would never take action to see if I was ok. It would have to be me who goes and pours out my heart to him, and hope that he had actually cared for me as friend like I did. 

What should I do? Is a person like this worth it? I had always hoped that we would become good friends, but if it's a relationship like this, I just end up feeling pathetic. 

Would appreciate any advice.

TL;DR:","  Friend has been consistently mean to me, and I have put a lot of effort into being nice to him. Recently he has acted in a way that I found very insulting. Should I continue to try to salvage the friendship?",  Asshole friend who's never treated me great was an even greater asshole recently. Should I keep trying to be his friend or move on?

TITLE: My Son has Medicaid from Washington but my Local Hospital Will Not Use It, What Do I Do?

POST: I recently had my two sons over to visit this summer (I am divorced from their mother). While they were here, one of them had to have an emergency CT. It turned out to be nothing, and the ER trip was only about 90 minutes total, so I was relieved.

After they left received 3 separate bills from 3 separate entities that allegedly provided service, totaling 3200 dollars. My son has Medicaid from his state of origin, Washington. I gave them his insurance when we walked in.

I live in Idaho.  Every person I talk to regarding these bills says ""we have no contract with Washington and we aren't a contracted provider anyway, so it's not going to fly.""  When I contacted Washington's DSHS, they told me they ""don't cover anything that happens outside of the state of Washington.""  Like, if someone's traveling or with their Dad in another adjacent state, they're just out of luck.

I don't have 3200 dollars. I can't even afford to make monthly payments on this, I am still making monthly payments on my own medical shit from years ago, and I save up all year to take my sons in the summer.

It makes no sense to me that someone could be poor enough to need Medicaid, but a hospital could feel like I could just pay 3000 dollars.

TITLE: Me [18M] with my ""friend"" [18F] ( Duration 5 years on and off..and on ):have started talking a little again bit now, however not sure if I am overreacting? Need opinions

POST: Keep in mind; when I say ' talk ' it usually means through the phone via messaging etc.

A few years back - we dated for like 3 months and things didn't work out well between us ( well for her ). I was really hurt but I moved on trying to get over what had happened between us. However I don't know what my past self was thinking and we ended up becoming friends instead of strangers. This lasted for 3 years.

Just last year - I lost my shit and we got into a huge fight which basically started from her not replying as fast as she used to, it was stupid and I regret it tremendously because since then we have not talked much, like none at all. Which leads us onto this week.

It just came as a shock when she called up through her phone crying because her pet had died ( like on a Thursday night last week )and as a good Samaritan, I comforted her. Then all of a sudden boom ; we're talking again - like ""friends"". Why did I put quotation marks? Basically ""something"" feels weird between us - I feel as though I'm only there because she needs comfort and someone to talk to after school, but at the same time I feel like she wants to repair the relationship that was broken. I would also like to mention the conversation we have is 'dry' - we don't have much to talk about really.

Don't get me wrong, she's a lovely, modest person and all but sometimes you cannot really help to wonder if she's putting on a facades to get what she want. I'm saying this because earlier she asked me to mind her folder until we had the next class ( which was during lunch breaks ) as she did not bring her bag to school since she finishes early. Am I being paranoid? When the past few months I swear we have been avoiding each other like the plague!

What do you guys think? Is she manipulating me or is she trying to fix our relationship?

TL;DR:","  Talked to my friend again after a long break, however not sure if she is trying to repair the relationship that was broken or is she just being manipulative?",  Friend stops talking after an argument.

POST: Hey /r/relationships,

Here is my situation, I have recently entered a relationship for the first time since high school (some might say my first ever).  After being single for basically my entire life I am kind of having trouble getting out of the single mindset.

I really like my girlfriend, she has similar interests, very attractive, good major in college, the sex is really good, and we laugh a lot.  Still with all of this I find myself taken aback when I realize I can't pursue other girls.

I haven't had any slips so far, and I am trying really hard to not view other girls in a sexual way, but it can be quite hard when they start flirting with me.

So my question is, how can I work towards being comfortable being in a relationship?  I want to give this thing my best shot, since I think we are really good together.

Thanks!

TITLE: Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] of 2 years, issues after moving in together.

POST: So me and my boyfriend have been living together for about 4 months. We live with my daughter and we are both employed full time.
 

He is a good person and I love him, he gets along well with my 5 year old daughter. He is hard working, driven, and independent which are traits I value in a person. 

I'll get straight to the point and say we have had problems ever since moving in together. It started out as what I viewed as strange quirks and now his behavior has actually started offending me. 

I moved in to his home so naturally all of his things were here. I barely brought anything from my parents house. I brought one picture I wanted to hang and he was so weird about it. He said he didn't like the picture so it just sat on the floor for a couple months until I finally just hung it up. I just feel so uncomfortable/unwelcome in what is supposed to be my home. 

I cook, clean, and do all the grocery shopping/meal planning, most of the laundry and I pay half (I don't think he has cleaned the bathroom once since I've been here) on top of taking care of my daughter and working a full time job. If I don't do it the mess just stays there. I've told him about this, he says he will do it and help out but doesn't deliver.

He constantly wants to hang out with friends. We will go on a ""date"" and then almost immediately after he wants to make plans with friends. He invites me but sometimes it just gets old. I would like to hang out with him alone for a night for once but he always has to be drinking and getting rowdy. I've addressed this issue and he just says he doesn't want to do those things. I'm adventurous and like to explore and try new things sometimes that don't involve drinking and he is just so negative towards my ideas and doesn't help to make them happen.

TL;DR:",  Living with boyfriend of 2 years. He is very controlling and doesn't help to make plans with me. He often hangs out with friends instead of me. I feel uncomfortable and unwanted in his home. What can I do?,  Boyfriend is very aloof about relationship. He's not great but he's not terrible either./ Is it worth it to stay? I have all the bad things that come along with living with a partner but none of the perks.

The problems starting coming up when I was done with community college. Up until last year (fall 2013) everything was going amazingly. Then I applied to my local university and I ran into a problem. I was 3 units shy because one my courses was remedial. I did not know this when i initially applied. I was not informed of their decision until after summer 2013 was done.(this is important)

I get rejected and I decided to apply to spring 2014 for the university while taking a course during fall 2013 at my community college. I pass the course with a B and i receive my units. Unfortunately the university tells me, they don't accept grades from fall 2013 for spring 2014. they only accept them from summer 2013. So here i am, rejected again, and I can't apply to fall 2014 because the school has closed registrations for it. So once again i have failed to get in, but now it will be postponed even more.

I don't know what to do. I am being threatened to be kicked out if i don't attend that school, i am stressing out because where i live, (San Jose California, rent is extremely expensive and full time jobs are almost non existent.(without a degree). If i get kicked out I have never had a responsibility before in my life that involved money.(I.E RENT, bills) I currently have a part time job that i have asked for full time but will not give it to me.

We tried the friends thing for a while and then things got to a point where it was going to be us ""being together"" while we were both on breaks from college and then ""being friends"" while we were at our respective schools. It got messy when he started dating this other girl and I could tell she was getting feelings for him and he didn't care about her, so I told him that it wasn't fair to other people and that he couldn't have both situations (me at home, her at school).

 I told him that we could not contact each other for a certain amount of time. It's only been half of that time, but apparently he is taking the timeframe very seriously. (I'm really close with his sister, who is my age. She and I talked about this one night when I asked if he was moving on, which is what I want him to do). He was looking at possible jobs after he graduated over the summer and refused to apply for certain jobs or accept offers because they were out of state and farther away from me and he didn't want to move anywhere where it would put a strain on us getting back together.

I feel horrible knowing that he might turn down his potential dream job with some company just because he hopes we can get back together after that timeframe if up. How do I make sure he doesn't do something stupid like that without breaking the no contact rule I put in place? Is there anything else I can do to kind of help him?

POST: me20f/him21m. Together a year and a half, live separately.

Things were amazing at the start. He made all the effort to make me happy, initiated almost all contact, basically never made me forget I was loved.

Now, he is too comfortable in this relationship. I honestly feel taken for granted. He hasn't got his licence, (is getting it in a month) so I'm always the one driving, I cook dinner for him occassionally, buy him little things, tell him how I feel about him. He doesn't do any little things for me anymore.

(About the licence thing, I know it's stupid but I'm already getting upset about thinking about when he gets it... I'm absolutely convinced he will not do the amount of driving I have done for him. I get this sick feeling in my stomach knowing that I'd still be the one to go to him:( )

I don't want gifts or shit like that, I just want to feel appreciated and loved =( I'm tearing up now as I'm writing this... I love this kid so much. I know that he loves me, but he doesn't SHOW it anymore.

He said he'd take me to a jazz club. Never did. Said he'd take me to watch my favourite comedian. Never did. Hardly attends any of my family functions anymore simple cause he can't be bothered (He knows family stuff is important to me). I just feel like he does not make an effort anymore.

I don't want to break up with him, but I won't lie, I have considered it so much lately. Just because I feel so fucking unhappy over these little things. I feel miserable. And also stupid, because as soon as we are together we are amazing. Truly. And I think I'm overexaggerating. All these doubts and fights always arise when we're apart. I hate this feeling :(

How can I wake him up? Get him to appreciate me and show me he loves me like he used to? :( I'm sick of being the boyfriend in this relationship. I want to feel like the girl he'd do anything for again. =(

POST: Title explains the situation pretty well. I've already decided that I want to try make things work. For a variety of reasons that aren't important for the question I'm asking. I know I will see soon enough whether my decision was right/wrong. 

Is it possible for it to work? I feel like a lot of people would break up as soon as they found out. But I'm just looking for some examples or outside perspective. The popular opinion is that it can't, and I understand that. But is their examples of it working out for the better? Is it possible that it was a one time thing that was fueled by drugs and drink? (I guess I should say that she has said that she will never take drugs again and that she doesn't go out with those people anymore).

Time will prove whether I was right/wrong but I guess I'm looking for a little hope.

TL;DR:",  Been with girlfriend for 5 and 1/2 years. Cheated on me with drugs and alcohol. Already decided to try make things work. Is it possible for it to work out?,  Girlfriend cheated after drinking a lot and ending up taking drugs. I've decided to give her a second change. Is it possible I made the right decision?

TITLE: [18 f] My boyfriend[18m] is moving away for college

POST: Hey everyone. So my boyfriend and I have been dating since junior year of high school (so abut two years now). We had some vague plans to go to the same college in our hometown but he didn't make it in, so he's going to a school 8 hours away and I will be staying here (but living in dorms). The point is, he's too far away and because we are both very jealous (and sexually active) people, it's not feasible for us to continue our relationship long-distance.

So now I just have to get over him, right? But it's been hard. On one hand, I want to be ""over"" him and feeling good by the time school comes around (October) so that I can make new friends and focus on academics.

But the problem is, I'm leaving to go to my home country for one month (all of August). I figured that would be the best time to get over him, but we still have almost all of September before school starts. He and I both want to try to enjoy all the time we have left together, but is it really smart of us to kind of ""hold on"" for the month I'll be gone and then churn out the rest of our temporary relationship? 

I've been with him so long, and even now it feels weird and totally sucks that it's ending forever soon. But I still really love hanging out with him and probably wouldn't hang out with many people before college starts, anyways. 

I guess my request for advice is: what should my next course of action be? Should we break up and distance ourselves now, or should be try to hold on until summer ends? I know that breaking up will hurt me for quite some time so maybe I could use a month or two as a time cushion.

Really hope this stuff makes sense and I appreciate this community. thanks

TL;DR:","  boyfriend is moving away for college, we're both very jealous and it's not feasible for us to continue our relationship long-distance.

TITLE: NEED ADVICE: Have a friend who was supposed to graduate with associate's degree but our high school fucked her over.

POST: I have a friend who is in all college-level classes and is supposed to graduate with an Associate's degree. However, the counselor who is supposed to deal only with students who are graduating with their A.D. somehow managed to give her college-level classes but claim she cannot get her A.D. and can only obtain a general degree. That means that the sixty-two college credits she has earned are pointless. 

She is interested in knowing if she should drop the rest of her classes except for the two required senior classes. Or, should she keep them and graduate with a general degree and have sixty-two college credits to start college with. Dropping the classes will mean that her transcripts have 'withdrawn' on them and that might make her look bad to future .

She is simply interested in getting advice on the situation because it pretty much sucks that the last four years might end up being worthless.

TITLE: TIFU by asking our my best friend of 10 years

POST: So, the actual thing happened about 2 weeks ago on my birthday but I currently don't know what to do.

I've had a small crush on her for about 3 years now, but never wanted to risk messing anything up between us.

So it was my birthday and she called me and asked if I wanted to spend the day out with her, having nothing better to do I say yes. It started out with us going to the park and walking around for about 2 hours, then we went and watched a movie, and afterward we were hungry. We decided to go get some food, after about 10 minutes of talking and laughing at the restaurant table... I don't know what clicked in my head, but I decided to ask her out on an actual date...

The words escape my mouth ""Hey, uh, do you want to go out with me?"" 

She starts crying... She got up and ran out... And while doing so, she accidentally slammed the table and I got a crotch full of ice cold water...

I haven't heard from her since... Won't respond to my calls or texts... And school started back today and she avoided me like the plague... I don't know how to face her...

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] of one year are completely naive on how to deal with the stresses of a long distance relationship

POST: We've been dating for about a year and a half now, having started in high school, and now we're in college. We ended up going to different colleges, and with that came the stress of a long distance relationship. She is and was my first and only girlfriend, and aside from a short middle school fling, I'm her only boyfriend. On to the problem-

We both feel that we're 'growing apart'. Over the time from when we started college we've been able to visit each other for a weekend here and there, but never long term. This wouldn't really be that bad, considering when we first started dating we only saw each other for a short time during the week; we mostly communicated through an instant messenger. However, I think that the distance and different circumstances have highlighted a glaring fact- we really don't have all that much in common. When we were in highschool, we could hide this by talking about classes and the like, but now that we don't have any classes, teachers, or experiences in common, our chatting has dried to just about nil.

I am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing. I have an array of hobbies (not the least of which is dicking around on this website :P), whereas she tends to try something a bit on my suggestion, and quickly decide it's not for her, and go back to her pastime of rewatching TV shows she's already seen. 

I enjoy being around her, and going on dates is enjoyable. We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together. But I think that deep down we are sort of seeing that that might just be a byproduct of the fact that we don't have much at all in common to have any sort of passionate argument about.

TL;DR:","  Me and my girlfriend of one year and a half are completely naive on how to deal with the stresses of a long distance relationship. We don't have much in common, and our chats have dried to almost nothing.","  Girlfriend of 1.5 years and I feel like we are growing apart- is it just a normal feeling caused by a long-distance relationship, or is it a sign that we aren't meant to be long-term?"

TITLE: Me [25 F] with my [28 M] boyfriend of 6 months - I'm ashamed of my body-impedes sex life

POST: Throwaway because this is embarrassing. I've always had bad skin, and although my body acne is significantly better than it was as a teen, I still have breakouts and scars from prior acne on my chest, arms, back, neck and butt. I am very careful with what I wear (never anything shorter than short sleeves or open back, and NEVER any kind of bathing suit). I have a regimen to improve my skin, but the scarring is actually worse than the zits themselves - it makes my whole body look spotty and gross!

Anyways, because of this, I have always been EXTREMELY self-conscious of my body. Additionally, while I have lost weight, I am still somewhat flabby (skinny-fat, if you will), and I can only have sex with my BF in the dark when I am drunk (and when I'm sure he's had some alcohol as well... I guess so maybe he won't notice my body).

We are going on a beach vacation with his family this fall and I'm terrified. I wouldn't be caught DEAD in a bikini and I feel like a weirdo if I try to come up with an explanation as to why I won't wear one around anyone.

Long story short, I don't know if he's noticed the severity of my body issues, but I never let him see me naked in the light of day or sober.

Anyone else have similar experiences/suggestions?

TITLE: My [20 M] girlfriend [22 F] of eleven months, has been depressed and stressed lately. Her ex also recently tried to break us up.

POST: My girlfriend has been working really long retail shifts for the last two months and she's been getting extremely stressed out from it. She's been crying in my arms some nights because of it. Her ex also recently tried contacting her to get her to break up with me, but she told him to leave us alone and stayed with me.

I feel like she's been disconnected lately.  Messages I send her usually get a one-word reply.  She doesn't have the same passion for food or games like she used to.  Whenever I spend time with her in-person, she acts like she used to, but I think that she's hurting from the weight of all of these things in her life.

I've been depressed before in my life and I can see the same things going on with her that were going on with me.  I just wish I knew what to do other than be here for her. 
I really want her to be happy, and I've tried to help.  I've gotten her candy, flowers, all of the cliche stuff, listened to everything she has to say, spent time with her together going out on dates and dinners, lunches, etc.

I always try and be there for her emotionally.  I let her know that I love her and that she can always talk to me about how she feels.  She says that I'm the best boyfriend she's ever had.

She knows that she wants to be a background artist for a video game company, but she can't get a good student loan to go back to school.  She's been really worried about not wanting to end up in a dead-end job forever.  

I think she's really talented and she could go far, but I don't know how to help her with that.  I've showed her some indie projects she could submit ideas to get her started down that path, but so much of her time is taken up by work.

TL;DR:",  My girlfriend is stressed out from work and her ex tried to break us up.  I've tried everything I can think of to help her but she's still depressed and stressed.

TITLE: My SO [27/F] has a lack of communication with me [28/M], it's been mentioned before.

POST: So, today I tried to plan a night with my SO (of 1+ year), and she tells me she has all sorts of errands to run.  I usually go to the gym on Tuesday, but since I had to pick her up from the Greyhound station last night, she assumed I was going tonight.  She didn't tell me last night that she had made appointments for tonight, or else I would've grabbed my gym bag.  I did in fact tell her last night that I wasn't going to the gym.

This particular situation is not a big deal, I can just hang out at her place until she's done.  What IS a big deal, is that last week we had an argument about her total lack of communication.  I even said these exact words: ""for the love of everything that's good in this world, please, please, please try to communicated better!""  I repeated that at different times until I was blue in the face.  Also, it's worth mentioning that I brought it up in a lighter sense a couple weeks before that.

I love her to death, but sometimes I feel like I have to be a psychic and it's gnawing away at all the good stuff.  Communication is one of the most important aspects of any relationship, and, though she seems to know that, she doesn't quite know HOW to effectively communicate.

POST: My ex and I had a brief relationship (around 2 months) a little over a year ago in college. We ended on relatively good terms. Despite being crazy for each other, we were both at tough points in our lives. Sometimes it felt like we didn't have time for each other. So she wanted to avoid either of us getting hurt and decided to end things. In my eyes it came from no where, since I was at least hoping to give things a shot. But I also didn't do much to try and win her back. I never fully got over her despite dating other girls and doing my best to move on. We had brief encounters in the pursuing months and it proved that she wasn't over me either. 

We both graduated and after a couple months back in my home town, I decided to move to a new city. It just so happens that she lives in this same city. It's not the reason for me moving, I have many other friends that reside in that city, its in the same state as the school I graduated from, so most of my college friends live there too. But now that I've been in the process of securing a job and apartment, my ex has spontaneously started texting me again. She is now aware that I am moving up there and has been mentioning how much she would love to see me. 

I'm still not over this girl and I'm scared to get hurt again. I was in a really dark place for some time following our breakup and it wasn't too long ago that I finally felt like I was taking steps towards bouncing back. I'd be lying if I said the thought of us getting back together doesn't excite me, but I can't go down the same road as before.

Her father actively despises her for this, her twin brother is an addict, and her parents are seeking a divorce. Her entire life since that incident has been a nightmare, and it shows in her relationships which have ended in her getting used and cheated on. Despite this she is very tough and resilient, but i think that stubbornness has run out.

She is very depressed and tells me how she has had enough and doesn't care anymore. her tumultuous relationship with her father is at the core of this. She dropped out of high school and just recently got her GED to show her dad she is willing to give schooling a second chance. The agreement was she would go to school and he would give her her car back. But he went back on his word and just yells at her and puts her down whenever she brings it up.

So now she's jobless without a car to take her to work and school and basically incapable of sustaining herself because of it. On top of that her dad kicked her out of the house for getting a tattoo, while her twin brother is an addict who comes home fucked up on god knows what.

TITLE: TIFU By being embarrassed of my smelly feet.

POST: So, this was actually many years ago. 

I was still a virgin and had it bad for my female flat mate. There were 4 of us sharing the flat and one of the guys was a real psycho.

One evening we (me and said girl) were out at one of her friends for the evening drinking and getting stoned after a night shift (we also worked together in a casino).

When it got to time to leave she decided she would stay the night on her friends futon to avoid dealing with Mr psycho, I was invited to share it with her.

This was after a 10 hour shift in a hot casino wearing cheap imitation leather shoes. Now my feet don't smell like roses under the best of conditions so there was no way I was gonna climb into bed with this girl, who I was truly besotted with, with feet that smelled like ass. 

So I made an excuse and went on my way, happy with knowledge that she was happy to share a bed with me.

I stepped out of the apartment, slipped on the stairs and snapped the tendons in my right ankle.

Painfully and sheepishly and climbed back up the steps and asked them to call an ambulance for me (the hospital was far away, no-one had a car of money for a taxi).

At the hospital I had a 4 hour wait and stern lecture from the staff about wasting an ambulance.

That girl ended up being the one that got away, a few months later she was pregnant by her now husband.

I am now happily engaged to a wonderful woman, but we all think about the one that got away, don't we?

I'm considering quitting my job, selling the house, taking my emergency savings and moving close to my family where I could afford to pay cash for a new home similar to the one I'm in.  The problem is my job title is practically non-existent back home unless I start up my own gig, which would make this future motherhood thing much easier if I could work from home.

If I do this, I need to consider that my start-up might take a year or two to take off.  In which case, I'm looking for some reliable investment income that would just pay the bills and health insurance, let's say $2400 a month.  I'm planning on buying a couple properties to rent out, but I want to be sure to diversify with the additional funds I have.  Is it even realistic to think I can generate $1000+/ monthly from stocks/bonds/etc. if I were to invest only $50k?

Up until now I've been playing around on etrade like it's vegas... investing a little here, getting back a little there.  So far my 5 month return has only been $4k, but that was with only an $8k starting investment, and since I didn't know much I kind of feel I just got lucky.

Any help would be gladly appreciated!

POST: So my ex girlfriend and myself were close friends for an extremely long time and eventually we got into a relationship (30/12/15) and she broke up with me a few months back (2/02/16). 

I loved her a lot and I still do. She really screwed me over and I never got closure from the relationship. We ended on good terms but we now no longer speak because she dislikes me for some reason. I still see her around college talking and flirting with other lads and it really makes me angry.

I get really protective and obsessive over her and I want to get over her before I do something crazy that I will regret. Any advice?

TITLE: I [21/M] have ALWAYS been in a relationship for about 5 years - how do I begin to have a positive relationship with myself?

POST: So I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit for my question, but I figure it's worth a shot!

I have been in relationships with multiple women since I was 16 pretty much constantly. The longest I've lasted without any sort of commitment has been literally a week before I've managed to rope myself into something new.

I have just broken up with my most recent girlfriend [19/F] after recognising that I think what I need most in my life for myself at this point is to be 'okay' with being 'alone' for quite sometime.
I don't think I'm a terribly dependant person (aside from emotionally) as I have certainly made a solid path for myself. More I feel this is a fear that I've avoided and simply never faced.

I have never let myself fully 'get over' someone and let myself go through any sort of heartbreak. I literally dive into the next thing.

I'm very scared at the moment of being alone - despite trying to be rational that I'm a young man with plenty of life to see. I guess it's more fear of the unfamiliar and unknown.

So reddit, how do I teach myself to be okay with 'being alone""?

POST: (not meant as a serious dissertation; there is little weight or concern on the matter. i just have too much free time sometimes.)

for several months i was unsure whether it meant IRL, or the anniversary of becoming a redditor. 

i think an excuse to have a party and feel special is fine, especially for children, and to a lesser extent young adults. i feel that to use it to beg for meaningless scraps of attention is absurd and unattractive, but so many of them do it they reinforce each other. most times i find it mildly annoying and ignore it and the post, but i wanted to put my thoughts here one time. i realize it's a petty complaint, but i still wish people would behave more like adults. unless it's all teenagers doing it. if that's the case, my apologies. but for some reason i strongly suspect that it's not limited to that demographic. anyone else have a thought on the matter they'd like to share?

TITLE: Feel like me and my GF are stuck in a ""loop"", could use some advice.

POST: My GF (23) and I (21), have been dating for 2 years and we had been acquaintances for a year or so before hand. We see a lot of each other and spend the night together 80+% of the time, whether at my place or hers. 

We have had a recurring argument for a long time that comes up every 2 months or so about her perceptions our relationship, where she feels that I take her for granted, that she does so much for me that I don't seem to appreciate and that I'm not always there for her. Often the argument comes up after one of us has been away from the other for a couple days. I try to be supportive and talk it out with her because its important to me that I understand her frustrations and make sure it doesn't happen again but when we start getting to the root of the problem (this can take a very long time, since she is reluctant to talk about it) she tends to get more upset saying that explaining herself just makes her sound like the ""bad guy"". When I tell her that its really upsetting to me that she does this (It gives me the feeling that I've done something horribly wrong but it never gets resolved and I never get any indication of how to be a better BF for her) she shrugs it off and we go on until the next time this happens. 

In the mean time she has been busier and busier with school, spending little time with friends, since her free time is usually spent with me (her choice) and our sex life has been less and less active.

I just feel like we're stuck in a loop and at the same time our relationship is faltering in other ways. I'm not sure what to do.

TITLE: Definitely wanting to change my major but I would like some opinions

POST: Apologies in advance for the length and I would like to note that I do have plans to talk to various people at my university but I would like to hear from fellow Redditors who have perhaps been in similar situations.
Anyways, here's my situation:

I am currently a sophomore graphic design major. When I graduated high school I thought for sure that graphic design was what I wanted to do but after getting a little farther into the program and looking ahead, I've decided that it's not something I want to continue with.

For those wondering why I don't want to continue, I'm honestly just not as passionate about graphic design and the time commitment is causing me a lot of stress. I hate to sound lazy, but I want a major/to take classes that will allow me to have a life. I've even found myself wishing I had papers to write.

With that being said, I am not 100% what I would want to switch majors to, but I do have some ideas. At the same time, I don't want to completely switch to another major only to find out that once again it's not what I like. I am definitely finishing out this semester in my graphics classes and I plan on putting forth effort, but I'm not as concerned about whether or not my projects are ""portfolio-material.""

Here is what I am thinking about doing for next semester:
I have not taken a ton of general education courses so I am wanting to take a variety of classes that interest me and also fulfill general education requirements. Of the possible majors I am thinking of switching to, some of these general education classes do apply to them or fit in the same category. Is this a good idea? Like I mentioned before, I don't want to completely throw myself into a different major in the event that it's not what I'm interested in.

TL;DR:","  Currently a graphic design major, not as passionate about it, would like to switch to something else but don't want to completely throw myself into another major. Is it a good idea to consider changing my major?",  wanting to switch majors but uncertain as to what I want to switch to; should I take a variety of general education classes that interest me next semester?

First thing I do is call my dad, sheer excitement pouring out of my voice like an orgasmic Niagara Falls.

(Introducing Senor FU) Riddled with happiness I jump up for joy, pull my knees in (I swear I got some hang time) and extend them outwards.

My left foot lands on the floor, entirely on the left pinky toe. And I collapse.

Pain shoots up my left leg like Satan himself had just decided to test it as a new location for hell. As if he were sexually assaulting my foot with a barbed fishhook.

After an hour of laughing at myself I decided to go to the doctor, handed in my insurance information and they took an X-ray. Doctor says I might have broken my foot due to how I can't move my little toe, but it might be a fracture or, even better, just a severe sprain.

POST: When I was 18, I met someone playing an online game. We had a ton of things in common, one of which is we were both gay. (We're also both Canadian.)

We started talking; one thing led to another and we ended up jerking off on a webcam together. We both willingly did this a few times.

Eventually it occurred to me that I was jerking off with a minor, and might be illegal. Not wanting to end up on a sex-offenders list or spend any time in jail, I quickly ceased all communication with my friend.

Fast forward five years, my now 20-year-old friend manages to e-mail me. He says that he's thought about me a lot and thought I hated him.

I do not know if she has been dating either. I have found a really amazing women and we have committed to each other and I can see this new relationship going somewhere. My problem is that I do not want my ex to find out I'm with someone else by seeing us out or by hearing second hand. I want to approach this as the adults we are.

POST: Me 21f and Boyfriend 23m
We have been dating for 1.5 years. We are past the honeymoon phase but overall things have been great. He is extremely caring, makes me feel special and we are both in love. We've gotten through some rough patches in the past and I really want things to work out well... but I'm having a hard time getting past this:

He got in touch with his ex-GF from high school recently. I know he basically loved her and pined for her all through high school and didn't entirely get over her until he met me. They occasionally kept each other updated by hanging out when they were both in their hometown or fb messages. She often says ""I miss you"" etc. which makes me a little uncomfortable. To some extent she enjoyed getting the attention from him in high school and kept him hanging even though she didn't like him that way. I feel like she may treat him the same now when she says things like that. 

She emailed him a while ago that she was coming to visit him. He told me of it immediately. She hadn't given any details but made it seem like her trip all the way was just to see him. I was uncomfortable and wasn't even in town at the time and expressed that to my boyfriend. He immediately told her not to come see him because I said so. It was only then that she revealed that she was visiting her family there along with her current boyfriend and it wasn't a trip just to see my boyfriend. 

I was a little embarrassed of this... but still feel like my boyfriend shouldn't have so bluntly told her it was my fault! It felt like he confided in her something that was between us and it just felt wrong! I trust my boyfriend completely but am so scared now that he confides in her things that are personal to us. He still wants to stay friends with her and I won't tell him not to do that... they have been in contact since then too and I try not to let it get to me but I'm having a hard time getting past it.

What should I do, Reddit?

We have been in a long distance relationship for all of the time, seeing each other only a couple of weeks or days every few months. I have known her for over 7 years now, and I really am in love with her. On paper we are perfect for each other. 

The only issue is that we do not live in the same countries. I grew up in her/our hometown and left to go study in the states 4 years ago, and recently returned to europe a month ago for a phd program. she is right out of high school and wanted to start with college in her hometown. 

we just had a lenghty skype conversation in which our future was a prominent part of the talk. Since she is starting with her bachelors right now, and I am in my first year of a phd program, it seems as if there is no end of this long distance relationship in sight. I really do not want this relationship to end, I know that I will regret it forever, since she has been my crush for ages and is also the perfect girl. I am pretty sure these feelings are mutual. 

Here is the question: How can we restore trust in this long distance relationship that seems to never come to an end?

I didn't know how many she needed so decided to bring the whole box down.

I couldn't see anything because the box was so big and about half way down the stairs, I began slipping. I almost regained my balance but started running/slipping down the stairs until I got to the bottom, dropped the box(smashing the plates and smacked my face into the radiator, breaking my front tooth.

I work in a very small office. There's only 6 people in the entire company. Everyone can hear everything from each others desks.

My boss is away on a conference right now and the 5 of us are at our desks. So when there's a knock at the door that's very unusual.

So this man comes in, he's wearing this side opened singlet, I can see his ribs, he's got wild, messy hair and ripped jeans.

My first thought was ""Oh god. A homeless person has walked into the office and is going to ask for money"".

But then he says ""I'm here to see James"" (not real name).

James is the graphics designer and my boss' brother in law.

James is busy on the phone, so this guy starts chatting with me. Makes a comment about my star wars mug and we talk about the new movie. He seems like a nice guy.

James finishes with the call and says ""Ok, lets go outside and chat"".

15 minutes later James comes back on his own and I say ""Hey James, no offence intended to your friend, he seemed like a nice guy, but when he first came in I thought he was homeless and was going to ask for money"".

James responds with ""That's my brother in law. Your boss' brother"".

My face goes red and the entire office has been quiet since the incident.

He says he still loves me and wants to stay together, and that this has been due to his depression. I helped him find a better doctor and a therapist. But our patterns haven't changed, he's still passive and unaffectionate. We've talked about it several times and he's promised that he will change, but he never does.

TITLE: My [20 F] boyfriend [22 M] of six months is depressed and thinks everyone treats him terribly and I can't seem to help him

POST: My boyfriend seems to be struggling mentally recently. He is unhappy and negative most of the time. He's told me a lot of worrying things for example that his existence is sad, that he might have mental illness, and that he's a bad person. Nothing I say comforts him. When he tells me stuff I tell him that his feelings aren't wrong or made up but it's likely that depression or some other mental issue is affecting his perception somewhat, and that I don't think he's a bad person or his existence is sad, etc. He literally will respond ""I don't feel comforted by your words"", and the one time I suggested seeing a professional he got angry and shut me down. So, my first question is whether anyone has advice on how to talk to someone struggling with depression, and how I might be able to suggest a therapist without upsetting him.

The second thing I want to address is that he feels like pretty much everyone treats him worse than he deserves to be treated. 
From my perspective people treat him pretty well. He has had a couple ex-girlfriends that seem to have treated him poorly. Today he texted me ""People definitely treat other people better. That's just a fact. It's something about me"". Just based off our own relationship I feel like he tends to sort of victimize himself. He definitely feels like he gives significantly more than he receives. I didn't realize until recently that this attitude might extend to his other relationships as well. So my second question is to people who have had experiences with people who feel this way. Is this attitude likely to change? I don't want to call him sensitive because that seems very dismissive but I also don't think on the whole people treat him badly and I have a difficult time agreeing with him when he says stuff like that which I think bothers him.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend is depressed and thinks everyone treats him terribly. He also feels like he gives significantly less than he receives. Anyone have experience with someone who feels this way? How can I help him?,  My boyfriend seems to be very unhappy with his life and I don't feel able to help him. He also feels that most people treat him especially badly which I just don't agree with.

TITLE: Me [40 F] with my husband [40 M] . . . we have been married 17 years. He has absolutely no interest in going out on date nights, not even for our anniversary or for my birthday.

POST: I'm just hurting inside. Number one, he doesn't want to spend time with me without the kids. Number two, it doesn't matter to him at all that I would like some time without the kids. You'd think that even if he didn't want to go out, he'd do it at least once a year for me, you know?

We moved here, 400 miles away from my family, so he could take his dream job. Between work and school he is often gone 80 hours a week. One of our children is special needs with sensory processing disorder and anxiety/depression. I do most of the parenting while trying to run a freelance business on the side. 

My family would often help with the kids but without the family support and with him being gone it's so hard. And he won't compromise. He just doesn't ever want to go out on date nights. He'll happily go to a baseball game for work or go out golfing with his buddies, but he'll never do anything for me. And I get really sad that he doesn't seem to crave any alone time with me.  

Am I being unreasonable to want to get out on a date night? What should I do?

TITLE: Me [17F] with my SO [17F] of 1.3 years wants to break up because of distance. Need advice on how to cope

POST: Hey Reddit,

So this was my first serious relationship with this amazing girl and it was almost near perfect. Unfortunately life decisions are causing us to seperate in the upcoming months with atleast a 6 hour difference between us. This distance will not go away for atleast the next 6+ years and I totally realize sustaining a LDR with no end goal is very difficult.

She said said she would like to break up and become friends as we get closer to going our seperate ways. Initially, I wanted to atleast give it a shot and see what comes of it - and if we were both truly unhappy I would be fine with breaking it off. I understand now, that this will only delay the eventual breakup and I support her decision as well.

I'm having difficulty with realizing what this means though. It bothers me when I realize I wont get to know the little things in her life or be a priority anymore. It bothers me that eventually she will get intimate with someone else thats not me. She was the first person I would tell when something happened to me, now I dont know who will listen to the little things with the genuine interest she had. Again, this is my first long term relationship so I'm wondering does it really get better. Will I wake up one morning and no longer wonder how she is doing? For now, some mornings I wake up feeling physically sick realizing that we will be near strangers in a matter of months.

TL;DR:",  SO of 1.3 years wants to break up because of distance. I support her decision as well. It bothers me that eventually she will get intimate with someone else thats not me.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my SO [23 F] of 3 months - seems unenthusiastic when asking me if I want to hang out

POST: We hang out often, we thoroughly enjoy each other's company, and don't really have any issues in our relationship. Pretty vanilla. But a small thing that's been bothering me lately is how she goes about asking me if I want to hang out with her.

If she's going out to a party, or out with some of our mutual friends, she will typically ask me if I want to come along. But when she asks - and I think it's something she's unaware of - she doesn't seem like she really wants me to be there. For example, she never explicitly states that she wants me to be there, it's usually just ""Hey, there's a party"" or ""Hey, do you want to come hang out with x & y"". And if I say no, and I give some sort of reason, she never fights to get me to go. She never really shows any emotion when I say yes or no. She just says ""all right"" and moves on. I don't think she's ever explicitly stated that she wants me to go. How i've felt about it recently, is that she acts as if she's completely okay with me not going and that she's asking because she feels she's obligated to, because i'm her boyfriend.

I love that she asks and lets me know almost every time she goes out, but it just doesn't make me feel very special when she words it in that sort of way. I'm going to bring it up soon and tell her it bothers me, but I wanted some input from unbiased people beforehand. I might be looking too much into it, not sure.

TITLE: TIFU by meeting the girlfriend's parents...

POST: So, unlike most posts, this happened today. I figured it would make a good first post. 

A little background: I've been seeing my girlfriend, let's call her Sarah, so 4 months now, and we're both at uni. Sarah comes from a traditional 'no sex before marriage' family, but she doesn't seem to follow that rule. It was quite an important weekend as we're getting serious, and she wanted me to meet her parents.

I took Sarah out for dinner yesterday, and we stumbled back to her uni flat (where I was staying that weekend) after a few drinks to well, you know ;)... First thing we did wrong: we forgot to lock the door... 

So next morning, we woke up and when Sarah looks at her phone and starts to panic. It turns out she forgot to tell me her parents were due in half an hour. She jumps up and goes in the shower (her university has en-suites). A few minutes later I decide I should probably move, realising I didn't have much time, I got up, fully naked at this point, trying to find my bag to get some clothes on, when there's a knock at the door. I thought, stay quiet it'll be fine, & Sarah couldn't hear it over the shower. Next thing I know the door opens, time slows in my mind as I find her family (parents, and her 2 younger sisters aged 17 & 18) stood in the doorway staring at my semi-erect member... As awkward as this is it gets worse, Sarah then walks out the bathroom naked having forgotten her towel, to find me standing staring at the door in silence. She turned see what was there and well... I'm pretty sure she wanted to cry with embarrassment. 
Her family on the other hand, I'm sure her dad was ready to kill me, her mom and sisters were just staring at my body (what can I say? I'm quite well built ;) ).
After an uncomfortable amount of silence, they said they'd be back later and closed the door... 

How the hell do I get on with her family now!?

TL;DR:","  met girlfriend's parents, forgot to lock door, her family saw semi-erect member, awkwardness ensued, how do I get on with her family now?","  due to meet the gf's parents, forgot to lock the door. Next morning her family walk in whilst I was naked..."

TITLE: Outside perspective with a friend.

POST: I (30f) have a friend (25f) and we have been pretty close the last 3 years. She was my maid of honor in my wedding and we hit it off right away quickly becoming best friends. 
The last few months I have been noticing how incredibly toxic she is. Constantly saying she will do something and then fall through. I catch her lying and she denies it. When her love life is going well, I fall to the sidelines. 
When I bring things up to her that upset me she always turns it against me. She does this so often that I start to question if I really am a horrible person for being hurt that she is late, doesn't let me know she won't be able to come while I've been waiting, or being thankful enough. 
I need to find a way to end this relationship, but I worry as she deals with depression/anxiety (as do I) and when another friend finally called it quits she told me how she contemplated sucide. 
I really just need an outside perspective on this as I've been struggling for awhile.

TITLE: Sex Issues in an Otherwise Great Relationship

POST: My boyfriend and I (both 27) have been living together and dating for about two years (we started out as friends who lived together with another roommate.) I am a girl. Just need some advice, thanks. :)

The problem is that he has always had a much lower sex drive than I do. We have sex maybe 3 or 5 times a month, and when we do it is usually satisfying for both of us. But he usually just says he is too tired or that he wants to get up early so he has to sleep instead of sex, or some other barely-believable excuse. I basically just have to wait for him to initiate sex. He claims to be very attracted to me and I am extremely attracted to him. 

I still feel a lot of pressure to initiate sex and seduce him, even though when I do it rarely works which usually ends up with me being all excited for no reason. There is a constant conflict in my mind about whether or not to attempt any seduction and risk the rejection.

This whole situation is slowly eroding my self-esteem and I feel like I am acting like a different person more and more. I have talked to him about it but he takes it very personally (understandably) and I basically have to accept him how he is or break up.

Is this a bad reason to break up? Could this be caused by his alcoholism? Has anyone found any effective ways to deal with such a situation? Masturbation is not nearly as satisfying, emotionally or physically, as sex with my SO.

TITLE: Is it okay to talk to a dead friend's family members about him?

POST: I had a friend who died in a plane crash a few years ago. He was a pretty young guy, though 8 years older than me. It was very tragic and unexpected. His family has been good friends with my family for many years, and since we met when I was around 10 I had considered him a mentor to me -- he taught me a lot of things related to programming (which I was interested in as a teenager), helped instill a love of learning in me, and gave me a ton of life lessons in general all while making me feel that it was coming from a friend. All in all, he was a great guy. 

His parents still visit mine quite a bit. One time when his mom was at my parents' I brought him up, thinking I would tell her some of my memories of him and basically telling her how much I admired and respected him. She started bawling inconsolably. This was maybe a year ago. This weekend, they were at my parents' place again. Me, my girlfriend, my sister, and his sister were sitting and talking. My girlfriend's socially awkward, high-functioning autistic 15 year old brother has started very much getting into learning about computers, and I try and emulate my friend towards him. My girlfriend's brother somehow became the subject of conversation, and I brought up my friend. I'm not sure how his sister took it -- there was a fleeting instant of very strong emotions on her face, but she shrugged it off and kept the conversation going.

My questions is, is this a big faux-pas? Should I avoid bringing him up in the future? Reddit, what do you think?

TITLE: Me [34 F] with [28 M] seeing for 2 months, started communicating less then gave the we need to talk

POST: Hoping for the best here but want to see what others might glean from this. We have been dating for a little over 2 months, instant connection, spent a lot of time together the first month and a half. Then he got busy at work and side project and started being around less and responding intermittently to texts. 

I sensed something was up (assuming just stressed out) and started inviting him to more things and for him to stay over at my place more - with the intent of ""hey this will take your mind off stuff"" - ""not hey i am needy.""

Anyways, he was going to be out of town for the day and I sent him a text with a (tasteful and cute) photo of me and texted ""if you want to cuddle when you get back"" - no response. He had mentioned having issues with texts so I texted him a little later and was like ""did you get the photo?"" and he responded **""yeah, sorry it did. it's not a great time but we should talk about this""** and I responded that that would be good.

The next day I texted back that I wanted to talk and thanked him for bringing that up and said I sensed he was stressed which is why i was inviting him out and offering my company and he responded **""yeah. sorry these projects just crept up on me""**

So that is it, his responses were kind of vague so wondering what you all glean from it. I really like him and he has said the same about me, we haven't officially called whatever it is a relationship but i feel like it is, so this weirdness is really stressing me out.

TITLE: I [17] am starting to fall for my best friend [17]

POST: Lately I, 17 male, have gotten really close to one of my best female friends who is also 17. I have known her since freshman year of high school and we are both now seniors. I haven't ever had a romantic attraction toward her until within this week.
I have started to become more attracted to her because we have been hanging out more frequently, other than just IMing or texting each other. A lot of people have also asked the both of us if we are interested in each other or dating, and that has made me reassess the whole situation.
I don't want to like her because i'm afraid we will end up dating and then it will never be the same between us, if we break up
She asks advice from me about other boys that she has her eye on and thinks are attractive, so I'm pretty sure that she doesn't have any feelings toward me other than being her best friend.
She is also super indecisive about how she feels toward boys that she does like. At first she likes them a lot but then once their true colors start to show she loses interest.
I don't want to distance myself but I feel as if I am doing that already.
Should I tell her how I am feeling? And if so, how do I go about doing so?

TITLE: Am I [25M] being paranoid with the communication gaps w/ my SO [28F]

POST: My SO & I have been together since June in a LDR, with her studying a broad in Europe (met her online). She will be here for the holidays, so we will be together soon (which were are ecstatic & giddy for)

We text daily from sun up to sun down & Skype as often as possible. Our future is mostly already planned, but other things like kids will be discussed when she gets here. 1-2x a week there will be a 3-4hr gap minimum between her last text. During that time I still text saying how much I love her, how much she means to me, ask her how her day is going and such. Being that she is 5hrs ahead of me I always take that into account as for gaps.

I'm always worried about her being that I can't physically be there to protect, so that is always on my mind daily. When the long gaps occur I become even more worried, so I text her from every hour to every 30min asking her a question. I don't want her to think I'm clingy, since I know most women hate it. She knows how much I worry about her being that we are so far apart.

After 4+ hrs she replies saying ""I luv u"" ""miss u"" ""srry I wrried u"". I tell her it's alright & that I'm just glad to know she is safe...she tells me she loves me always right after.

TITLE: I (26F) have been recently sleeping with a friend (27M) who is behind my back now pursuing a relationship with a close mutual friend. (20F)

POST: I don't know how I feel.

I've recently gotten out of a five year relationship, of which the final 6 months he had a seriously full blown emotional and physical affair.

Coming out I felt great, I met a great bunch of new friends - a mix of guys and girls. About 5 months into the friendship, I started sleeping with one of the guys. We agreed it was casual, and neither of us would pursue it again. But he did last week, very much so. We slept together multiple times that night.

So I hear a conversation between him and one of the girls in our group about how he doesn't remember sleeping with me or not. I confront him, and he tells me he remembers 100% of the night, and never said that to her.

Him and this girl, over the days following, are all over each other right in front of me. Tonight, I over hear a conversation between her and another one of the friends, that he asked he on a date. She said she sees things happening between them next month.

I feel total used and in the dark. But don't know if I should feel that way. I've since heard he has no recollection what so ever about the conversation he had with her. 

I just feel like he's been selfish, liking this girl, sleeping multiple times with her friend, but still then asking her on a date... I'm so upset, and hurt. And I feel like this is a beyond weird situation. But do I have a right to be upset? I feel like he hasn't cared about her either. Whenever I hang with them if I were to walk in, I'll now always be the girl who slept with her bf.

They're all using the excuse that he was always the fat, unattractive guy who girls didn't like, and now he doesn't know how to handle his new found 'attractiveness'. I feel like we've all been through that though, and if I were in his situation, I'd make one of the two decisions and keep it that way.

TITLE: Something weird happened at a party last night - Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [28 M] of 1.5 years

POST: Last night my boyfriend and I were at my friend's house party. He was playing cards in the living room and I was hanging out in the kitchen but I could still see and hear what was going on. He was sitting next to this girl that we have met a couple of times before but don't regularly hang out with. At one point, she stood up, and apparently her legs were asleep and she fell back onto my boyfriends lap. He grabbed her hips and squeezed them and she sat there for like 3 or 4 seconds before finally getting up and he did nothign to get her off of him. I thought that was a little weird but was willing to let it go...

Probably an hour or so later I went upstairs to go to the bathroom. The girl who was sitting on his lap walked out right as I was walking up to it but just walked right past me without saying anything. I shut the door and went to check behind the curtain to check for murderers (old habits die hard) and my boyfriend was just standing in the shower crouched down. We both screamed and I asked him wtf he was doing in there and he said he didn't know, he was just really drunk. He was supposed to be DD though so he was only going to have a couple of beers and thats really all I saw him drink anyways, he was coming to the kitchen each time he wanted another. It just seems really unlikely that he was somehow drunk enough to be standing in the shower and have no idea what he was doing there. The rest of the night he played up the ""Really drunk"" act and he continued to drink a lot, to the point where he probably actually was really drunk.

It just seems really suspicious to me but he swears up and down he is telling the truth. When I ask him if he can understand how it looks from my point of view he says he wouldn't be upset because both of those situations were innocent, but I'm not so sure.

The first couple of days she had went away on the first holiday it was great, she would call me while her and her friends were getting ready and keep me up to date with how it was going and some funny storys here and there but then after a few nights it died. and me being somewhat clingy i was trying to text her still and got all wound up because i wasnt getting a reply. We'd normally text each other what we called 'cute texts' where we'd basically say how much we miss each other and cant wait too see eachother etc.

she came back for 2 days before she went on another holiday and so she invited me round hers for one. She was very tired and snappy and did not have a lot of patience. She can normally take good banter and i was just acting like normal and winding her up but i was called an asshole and she slept for most of the night.

I shouldnt of probably went round but she then went away on the other holiday. The only regular contact we had was us trying to keep our snapchat streak going... which consisted of a blank picture of whatever was infront of us and no real conversations.

ive told her i missed her a couple of times and rung her once but yesterday i sent her a snapchat saying ""miss you xx"" and she replied with ""stopit xx"". she seems to becoming ever more frustrated with me and i really miss the girl.

TITLE: First online dating experience. Rating: used

POST: Edit (at the beginning because I can't read--go me!): I'm 20. The guy in question is 23. I've known him for two months. 

So I decided a few months back to join a dating site because I had seen plenty of success with it among friends and thought I would give it a try. I wasn't planning on anything serious forming from it because I have a tendency to seem like a different (read: cooler, more relaxed, etc) person online. 
So weeks passed, I talked to some fairly cool people, enjoyed getting a chance to talk to people with different personalities and interests, and then one person messaged me and we instantly clicked. The similarities were astounding: communicating style, interests, political, philosophical, and social beliefs in line. We met IRL, hit it off, hung out a few times, and then he spent the night. We met up 5 times before that, so I didn't think it was moving too fast, plus the physical attraction was there.
Here we are a week and a half later and I've barely heard from him. He cancelled our last date (hang out? chill time? whatever you want to call it) in favor of going to the bar with his coworkers, and I've attempted to make plans since with no response. 
I suppose the main question here is am I right to feel used? I don't tend to jump towards extreme explanations but it follows, in my mind at least, that his motive in this was sex, and once that was achieved he moved on. It hurts because I thought we really had a chance at a friendship at the very least, due to the ease of conversation, how natural it felt talking to him, things like that.

TL;DR:","  Met a guy online, hit it off, hung out a few times, but he abruptly cancelled plans and has not responded to any attempts at making plans since. Is he just being distant or is there something more going on?","  Met a guy online, we hit it off, slept together 5 dates in and now he hasn't talked to me or responded to attempts to make plans in a week and a half.

POST: My ex and I had a very unhealthy relationship sexually, there was a lot of guilt involved. So in my current relations hip I still have all that guilt and fear. I thought time would fix everything, but that hasn't really worked. For a while I felt better, but now I have gone back to being scared every time she touches me. I am still attracted to her. But the fear gets in the way. I don't want to make it worse, but I also don't want to lose her or have her  resent me, and I feel very guilty for even thinking about this, but I am wondering if a break from sexually relations might help.

TITLE: What would you do in

POST: Me and a few friends are planning on going to Europe shortly and Asia for about four and a half months. The plan would be to start in Belgium, only to see Tomorrowland (a huge music festival). Then we would head to Amsterdam to explore the tourist attraction, this ends the Europe portion of our journey. From there we would fly to India and stay for two weeks, next, Nepal for two weeks. Fly to Laos for two weeks, then make our way into Thailand and spend about a month there. After that we would head to Cambodia for two weeks, then Singapore for three weeks. We would end the trip in Australia and stay for three weeks before heading home. A little less than five months on an ~$12,000 budget, lets say $10,000 to be safe. Where specifically in each country would you go? What would you do? What would you want to see? All of us are very outgoing and into nature. We want to do it all, Full-Moon parties, hiking, scuba-diving, sky-diving, visit some monuments and nature preserves, explore some caves and ancient ruins. The group of us is also not against spending time with locals to learn about culture, traditions and day-to-day life. I've done some research about each country so I have a rough idea of what I'd like to do. But to be able to hear some stories or personal experiences from you guys would be greatly appreciated!

POST: I met this guy eight years ago when we both started playing the same instrument. Ever since then I've always a bit of a crush on him. I've dated other guys and he's dated other girls, but these last few months when we have both been single, I reaaaallly fell for him. Like, pining over him. ( I realize how stereotypical this sounds coming from a teenage girl, but it's what's happening.) Today, after months of mixed signals, a negative prom response then apology for said response, many turned down date invites, and flirting on both our parts; I finally poured out my feelings for him. I expressed how amazing I think he is and all I got in response was a ""thank you gurll"". He outright told me he thinks of me as his best friend and that's all. So I realize I need to move on and get over him without spoiling our friendship (such as distancing myself and not talking to him). I think at this point I'll always just be his friend and nothing more. Reddit, how do you suggest I get over my feelings for him? Because honestly right now, I'm a mess.

I thought with patience and reassurance from my loyalty would help him to learn to put down his guards and trust again throughout the years.....but it hasn't..

His jealousy and paranoia has taken quite a toll on me and my relationships....everytime i go out he thinks im cheating or being deceitful...and i have been nothing but loyal and honest with him...and he will still never fully trust me...

TITLE: I (28M) broke up with my (25F) girlfriend of 9 months last night and I'm completely heart broken. All I want to do now is get back together with her but I'm not sure if that is the right thing.

POST: This is the first long term relationship I've had. I dated a girl shortly in highschool but then I joined the army. I was too busy training and deploying and living in a state I hated so I never made an effort to date back then. After the army, I went to college and dated a bunch of girls but never found one I was happy with.

During my last year of college, however, I found a great girl that I hit it off with right away. She had a boyfriend at the time but eventually dumped him and moved closer to where I lived. We became bf and gf and she has pretty much slept over at my house every night since she moved. 

I'm the type of guy that needs a lot of space and alone time and it has been a reoccurring issue in our relationship, where I want more alone time but she is unhappy when we are apart. I decided to sacrifice my personal space to make it work because she is so great but it does make things hard sometimes.

Another thing that had been bothering me, the most important, is that I didn't know if I was in love with her. We would always say I love you to each other and it always felt right, but then part of me wonders if I'm actually in love and that I might be too inexperienced to know what love is. I often thought about breaking up because of this. 

But now, after last nights break up, I'm absolutely crushed and heartbroken. There's nothing I want to do more than tell her I love her with all my heart and get her back. I really feel this right now but I don't know if this feeling will last if we get back together. I don't know what to do.

We were usually having a good time, laughing a lot, talking about stuff, but recently her behaviour towards me changed quite a bit. She responds to my questions with short answers, tries to ignore my jokes, conversations feel awkward and overall it looks like she is trying to keep distance from me. I can occasionally catch her off guard and things are back to normal, but only for a short period of time. 

To me it feels like she likes me or falls for me(or whats that word), but she doesn't want to end her current relationship. Could it be the cause of her behaviour? Or what else? How do I change things back to normal?

POST: I've been in plenty of short lived relationships before but I just can't seem to differentiate if they are real feelings or feelings I'm forcing myself to have because I am lonely.

I have a really big trust issue because of my mother being a cheater and dragging me into her other relationships when I was young. Also, being in the military I see how quick people are to cheat on and lie to their SO.

I am a really emotional yet reserved person, if that makes any sense? I also have anger issues, which I have been working on but it isn't an easy journey. I try to keep a distance from people because of these reasons and I know I can't be in a happy relationship unless I am happy with myself.

Even though I feel that way, I still feel null and void of so many feelings. It makes it hard for me to truly connect with someone, because I feel like I do it out of loneliness or boredom. I've been through a lot in life already so I think way too much for my own good and I'm a lot to handle.

I'm not trying to rush for a true love or anything like that. I just don't know if I'm even capable of realizing when I really have feelings for someone.

So there we were, shopping in the mall when he randomly asked me ""What does prostituted mean?"". I was taken aback since I know what type of books and videos he watches, so I wouldn't expect him to hear this word. But nonetheless, I begin to explain to him what 'prostituted' and 'prostitution' mean.

I start to explain to him that people really love sex and what 'sex' actually is. I continue to expound that some people love sex a lot but don't have girlfriends/boyfriends/SO/etc to have sex with. Therefore, there are people who offer themselves in return for money or other favors for sex in return. And therefore, they're prostituting themselves.

He has a dumbfounded look on his face after... He then asked me Why would people be ""prostituted"" to the fullest extent of the law for stealing then. I then notice the sign across from us stating 'you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for theft'.

I lose my cool here. I yell at my brother ""YOU LITTLE SHIET, ITS PROSECUTED, NOT PROSTITUTED. LEARN TO READ DIPSHEIT!""

TITLE: How do you fit social drinking into a healthy lifestyle?

POST: Hi Loseit!

This subreddit has helped me make some drastic changes to my lifestyle, but there's one thing that I have a constant struggle with that I need a little advice on. I tend to eat around 1200-1300 calories per day and exercise daily (cario + weight training). My goal is less numbers-based and more about feeling healthy and getting in shape, as I am already at a healthy weight for my height. In contrast, my SO (in the ""obese"" range at 6'1"" and 235lbs, used to be 180lbs freshman year, but gained all the weight after he joined a fraternity due to the drinking culture) constantly says that he wants to lose weight, but so far he has only been making minimal effort by means of eating a little better and going to the gym a couple times a week with me. 

We're both in college and in Greek life, so something that's central to our social lives is drinking. During this past semester, I've been mostly sober, but it's getting harder and harder to tell my friends why I'm not drinking because they don't take me seriously. On top of this, my SO feels like we should drink with our friends since it's our last semester and begs me to drink with him, but he rarely stays within a reasonable number of drinks, often averaging 7-8 beers or mixed drinks in a night. 

Does anyone have experience dealing with situations like this? What can I do to get my SO to stop binge drinking and ruining the minimal progress he makes each week? And how do I help him to see that making changes to our lifestyle is the best way to lose weight? Any tips or advice would be great because I've been stressed out about this for weeks!

I'm posting this here in hopes that I'm not overreacting over something completely stupid.  I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for about four months.  He has been posting pictures of his gorgeous coworker on his instagram, she's posting back hearts, and it's starting to make me feel sick.  It would be one thing if he had told me that he's in love with me and I suppose I wouldn't feel so insecure - I'm pretty laid back, but she's really hot, and it's just striking me as being not cool under the circumstances.

I was thinking that I would nicely say, ""I can't help but notice that you're posting a lot of pictures of that girl.  I don't mean to let it bother me, but it makes me feel like she's important to you in some way which makes me feel pretty awful on many levels"".  I don't even know.  Part of me just wants to peace out.  I'm too old for this and I already feel like I've had my heart trampled.

POST: Quick background: We met via a dating app and after a few days of chatting decided to meet up for brunch (her idea) two weekends ago for a first date. I was bit hesitant about brunch for a first meetup due to the time commitment in case it became awkward/uninteresting etc. but it turned out to be one of the best first dates I've been on. Conversation flowed really naturally and we had a lot in common and overall we both had a lot of fun. 

We agreed that we should do it again and after a couple of rescheduling conflicts (we both have pretty busy jobs) met up for a bite drinks after work last Thursday. Again, conversation was great and we had a fun time and even talked about what we should do next time we went out together. 

I texted her Sunday asking if she wanted to check out this cool bar we both heard of (one of the places we talked about going to on date 2) and haven't heard from her since. I consider myself pretty good at getting social cues and taking hints, but am wondering if somewhere along the lines I just screwed this up. I've been on plenty of dates before, so unless i completely misread her vibe, i know when they go well and when they don't and every indication so far was that it was former. We're both really busy at work so that could definitely be a big factor as to the non-response, but at the same time she's been pretty responsive to texts before. The last time i heard from her was Friday, when we exchanged a couple of random texts during the workday. I sent the last text that day so it's been two messages with no response.

At what point do i just move on and assume she did a 180? Is it worth texting her again? I just dont want to fall into the trap of being that guy that is constantly texting her as the next one will be the third text i send to her in a row.

TITLE: Skills Verification Exam for Programming position?

POST: So I have a skills verification exam for an entry level programming position coming up soon, and Im curious what it's like and what questions are asked. I did incredibly well on every programming class I took (Computer Science major) and have a really good handle and understanding of C++ with a good bit of C and C#. However, It's been a while since I've looked at some/many topics and given the time frame it's not practical for me to refresh myself on 2-3 years of programming. The things Im fuzzy on I know that I would be like ""Oh Yeah!"" the moment I got inside MSVS or went to actually start working on something but on a pen and paper exam I wont have the resources or time to make that happen. Just trying to get an idea of what I have in store for me.

TITLE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend [32M] and I no longer like his caress.

POST: I'm sorry if this in the wrong sub. My boyfriend and I are in a dead bedroom. We used to have great sex like six times a week. It was passionate, hot and heavy. It was wonderful and amazing. I don't think I've ever ""made love"" until I was with him. We have a great relationship. He is so caring and sweet. He always wants to cuddle, cooks for me, surprises me with gifts, and just other nice things. When I'm with him I feel like the only person in the world to him (lame I know).   
  
Sex now has been dwindling. And now it's four times a month, or three times a month. This month it has only been once and the month is almost over. I feel bad for counting but I this is something that I have been deprived of for almost a year. We have talked about it a few times on why his sex drive is down. He now has a stressful job with is very understaffed. I understand that but he masturbates so much. Now, I know it is much easier just to have wank than to have sex. I'm guilty of it, you the reader probably is to. I've tried many things to try and initiate sex, sexy outfits, new sexy underwear, some role play. I'm tired of masturbating and I'm now so irritable. Lots of little things just set me off and I know I need some sexual relief.  
  
Now I've come to the point where his touch no longer excites me. I actually don't want him to touch me. He usually grabs me. He'll grab my ass, my tits, and my whole body in a sensual way but it always goes nowhere. Now I don't want him to touch me. I don't like when he does, I almost always pull away.  
   
My question is how do we get back to normal? Is this normal that I don't want him to touch me? Is the only solution to break up? I don't want to break up, we just signed a lease together.  Everything is so great, he's so much more than my lover, he's my best friend.

POST: For the last 1 year and some months, she's been doing wrong things from my back and hiding it from me. Things like: flerting with other guys, taking semi-nude pictures with her girlfriend, talking with people i've already said i don't want her to talk to, etc. And then, when i ask her if she did any of this, she goes ahead and says ""no"". So i take out my proofs, like ""it's on your fucking phone! I saw it!"". And then she proceeds to complain about me getting too much into her personal live, stalking her and stuff. Well, the only reason i do that is because she keeps fucking up.

Now, she already said to me a million times that she's going to change for better, and that i should give her ""one more last chance"". I honestly already gave her more last chances that i can remember right now. Her last fuckup was flerting with a guy on skype, saying things like ""we should watch this tv show on bed together, i would love it"". This was the last straw to me and now i want to break up, and once again she says she will change. Now, should i give her another chance?

TITLE: Stupid lie... what to do?

POST: My girlfriend (27) and I (M 26) have been together for a little over a year and are now living together. 

Our relationship is going great, but I lied to her and now I'm not so sure about what to do.

A while back when we were back home (home for me, we live in her hometown 10 hours away from mine) we were at a party with a bunch of my friends. She asked me if anything ever happened between me and a specific female friend and I said no.

The truth is, between the ages of 18 and 21, we slept together maybe 4-5 times total. It was never anything between me and that friend. More of an ultimate backup if we both didn't have sex for a long time.

Because of the living situation, we see that friend maybe once a year. Also what happened between us was so long ago and so minimal that I don't know if I should just come clean or not.

Looking back, I think I lied because when she asked I realized I should have mention this before we arrived at the party and I didn't want to blindside her.

Now I'm torn because I'm not sure how she would react if I told her. Plus everything else is going really well between us.

TITLE: Choosing apartments - Living above a store/restaurant

POST: Me and my girlfriend are planning on moving out mid-july to beginning of August. Finding the right place has really been a pain in the ass. It's only the beginning of the month, but we found two suitable places:

Apartment 1: Looks recently renovated and very clean. The sinks and the appliances were very new.  The landlord seemed very kind and caring about the building. However, one of the big drawbacks bugging me is that it's located above a store/restaurant. The entrance was separate, but around the corner in a weird spot. It's also a bit smaller than I wanted, and lacked storage space. There are no laundry facilities in the building but there is a Laundromat one only a couple blocks away. 

Apartment 2: This one was very large for a great price. Although do like it as well, my girlfriend is a little iffy about this one. Some things were a bit beat-up, mainly the hardwood floors. Older appliances but I don't mind. The landlord was kind but I'm not sure how well kept thing will be in the long run. The building in no way looked dirty, but it did look like things could be repaired here and there. There are a few small chips and cracks on the walls, which worries us because we live in a city where bedbugs roam. We worry about those and other bugs coming in that way. I do feel like our view of this one is skewed because we viewed it before they had a chance to clean and paint it.

Our other option is to wait out for other units to become available elsewhere. I'm just afraid of leaving things too long as places have been snatched from me the same day I viewed them. Both places are in the area we like, but I feel like it's a bargain between new renovations vs. size. 

What do you think? Apartment 1 or 2? Or wait out for another option? Has living above stores/restaurants been a problem for anyone else?

TL;DR:",  Me and my girlfriend are planning on moving out mid-july to beginning of August. We found two suitable apartments but one is located above a store/restaurant.

TITLE: United First Class Upgrade bait and switch

POST: On 3/31 I went to upgrade the outbound flight on myreservation to First Class- in the amount of $190.98 each for 2 seats (total $381.98).

Immediately after checkout I went to select seats and saw that I could upgrade my return flight to first class for $50 per seat ($100 total). i checked out with my credit card for the second time and selected my seats. I verified on my credit card that there were 2 pending charges from United: $381.98 & $100. I noticed today that the $100 charge has changed to $381.98. 

Upon calling customer service and speaking to 2 different people for over an hour, I was told it was a glitch in the online system that showed $50 first class upgrade and they could not honor the price. 

I was told the system would not allow them to honor the $50 per seat upgrade. I suggested that in lieu of a refund, I would accept a travel credit in the amount owed to me ($281.98), but they said I had to send feedback through their site.

I fly exclusively United and am a very loyal customer, and I am flabbergasted that such a huge company would bait and switch me like they have done. Showing me $100 then jacking it up to $381.98.

So I've had multiple people come up to me and say ""You have a great voice"".  Not a great singing voice, just a nice, easy to listen to, talking voice.  The range of my voice is also pretty good as well, able to hit high and low notes on command.  I have even had a few people tell me that I should ""go be the voice of something"".  

I alway just kind of laughed it off, but the other day I thought maybe I would see if I really do have a unique voice.

POST: So several months ago I met a friend through a MMO.  I played with her and her husband and we gradually got closer as friends over time.  A few weeks ago, it comes out that she enjoys erotic role playing and asks me if I want to try it out.

Things go great, but I then ask about her husband and what he thinks about all this.  She says it's cool and that he is totally fine with it.  We do with several more times and she even goes as far as to tell me what her and her husband have done on several occasions.

However, this is a problem now.  I feel like I'm starting to get jealous of her when she does the same with other partners.  When she talks about what she does with her husband, I don't feel anything though.

TITLE: I [22 M] have been told by my friend [24 M] (of about a year) that they have feelings for me. However, I am not interested and they are not getting the message.

POST: So, I'm a leader in an on campus club at my university. About a week ago my friend, Cameron, (who is male but uses female pronouns) has recently told me that she has developed ""*deep, real, and excessive*"" feelings for me over the course of the past year. 

I simply explained that I am straight and not interested, that it doesn't change our friendship, and I take the confession of feelings as a compliment (as to not try and make things weird between us because she is my friend). A couple of days go by without contact or seeing each other on campus (it's finals week and everyone is on weird schedules) but eventually we see each other in the cafeteria. We have a short chat and part ways until as I left she calls out my name and blows me a kiss from across the room, which I had no real response in mind other than just to nod and walk off. In the past couple of days when we've seen each other, she's been very close and personal (more so than before she announced her feelings) and has constantly been complimenting me (also did not do before this event). Ever since the talk, she's just been over the top flirty and making me feel more uncomfortable.

Basically, she doesn't really gets the message that I'm not interested, even after I plainly spelled it out. I'm not sure how to go about this, because I'm also trying to be a friend and not come across as mean or a jerk (and I'm supposed to be a role model to my campus group).

TITLE: My [22F] ex [22M] little brother [8M] keeps messaging me asking when I am coming to hang out again. I don't know how to handle this because I don't want to be mean to the kid

POST: Hi Reddit, so this sounds kind of pathetic issue but I have no idea to do. I am dealing with an 8 year old child who absolutely adores me who is my exes little brother. Whenever I would go over to his parents' house he would want to play with me. He really likes me and he would always ask when I was going to Marry his brother. He would always show me his work from school and ask for my help. He has two other sisters who adore him as well, I always noticed they like their little brother a lot more than they did my ex. My ex and his sisters do not get along at all  

My ex and I broke up because he cheated on me when he went on a business trip to Las Vegas (probably another lie he told). His excuse was ""I had to get some pussy somewhere"". He was gone for a week and we had sex twice on the day he left. So if he can't save sex for a week then I don't know what to tell you. 

His brother keeps texting me from the home phone (it's the household cell phone, it is there for someone to call home if that makes sense). He asks me when am I coming over to play, when are we going to play video games again. The whole deal and I feel really bad for ignoring him. He really likes me and I would love to hang out with him/babysit him again sometime. That would mean having to potentially see or talk to my ex and I can't stand him. I can't stand the sight of him. 

How do I deal with this?

FOLLOW UP:  Thanks for all of the tips.  I was taking all of them to heart. It was quite an experience today.  Mainly because I didn't end up getting them pulled.

They were constantly checking on me asking how I was then finally the dentist comes back and says that they have to send me to a different office to get a different type of xray, and that I would have to pay out of pocket.  WTF? He said it was important because he was not sure if he would be comfortable pulling my teeth because they would be really difficult to get out.  So my wife drives me over to this other office where we get the x-ray done then head back.  Once back he takes a look at the xray and says, well I am not confident that I can get one of them out, and the others will be difficult but I can do them.... btw I am already livid.  He says I should really go to a surgeon and see what they think, so I say ""OK write me a referral and I'll go get a second opinion on all 4 teeth""  Suddenly he backpedals saying, ""well I think I can do three of them"" to which I reply ""You think?

TITLE: Can a Traumatized Dog be Helped?

POST: One year ago, I came home to see a skeleton of a hound dog stumbling all over my pastures.  I didn't have anything to catch her with, but I am a sucker for animals in need and tried anyway.  It took an hour of walking up and down the same fence before she just collapsed and I ""caught"" her.  We took her to the vet for two broken front paws, but nothing else was wrong with her.

She was so scared of everything, the slightest sound made her take off literally shitting herself.  A whisper could make her cower in the corner and pee everywhere.  My neighbor also told me he'd seen her thrown out of a truck the day before.  So I kept her, afraid she would be put down if I took her to anyone else.

It's been a year of taking sweetly, lots of food and treats, going on walks, befriending my other dogs, and sitting and petting her for long periods of time.  *A year.*  She still won't come to anyone but me, and she only started coming to me in the last couple of months, and being very nervous when she does.  She's still terrified of noises, movement, and pee's around anyone else.  She runs so much to avoid (even though they're not interested) my family and friends that feeding her three times a day still has her looking like a skeleton and sleeps standing up during the day to be ready to bolt again.  We had to triple reinforce the fence to keep her in because she continuously rams it to get out in a panic, cutting herself up once in a while, when one of us walks into the yard.  She doesn't even make eye contact, and flips out when she bumps into something like a chair.

I still don't want her to go elsewhere and risk a bad or no future since I know she is really a sweet and loyal dog under all the mess, but I am moving to start over in a couple of months and want her to come with us and start over, too...

Is there anything more I can do for her?  :(

TITLE: Any advice on taking back possession of a recovered stolen firearm while on misdemeanor drug probation?(FL)

POST: More than a year ago my home was burglarized and i had some firearms stolen from me. In the months following I was arrested for misdemeanor pot possession(wrong place wrong time). Instead of fighting the charges I took Pre Trial Intervention (PTI) which means i plead NOT GUILTY and enter a 12 month probation program which if I complete the charges will be dropped and with a little more lawyering my file sealed. Recently two of the firearms were recovered, one by a local agency and the other at a pawn shop in the next county. For me to get the firearm back from the pawn shop, I have to buy it from them for the money that they spent on it. The detective in charge of the firearm told me it would be okay for a friend or relative to pick it up I just needed to let him know who would be coming for it, but I also didn't inform him that i was currently on PTI. I'm just not sure of the legality of taking back possession while on PTI or even having someone else pick it up for me, and the last thing I want to do is get somebody else in trouble for doing me a favor. 

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation or able to offer me any insight on what to do next? Would a lawyer be able to inform me of the laws without much of a payment? Its already going to cost me a few hundred dollars to get back my own property that was stolen from me and its not really worth it for me to put out much more for something that i dont think i need representation for.

POST: My girlfriend 27 has grown up with a very strong set of beliefs that there should be no sex/foreplay/cohabitation till marriage, subsequently she has never had a solid relationship, has never had sex or fallen in love. To put things in perspective, she had recently achieved (her first) orgasm one night I had helped her though her cloths.

So here we are dating... going out to dinner a few times a week, making out on the couch like teenagers. If I press her too far sexually, she then regresses back and that is not done for a few weeks. Meanwhile I am thinking, that I will never be close enough to marry her if we are not progressing the relationship (foreplay, spending the night, maybe even moving in with each other at some point).

--------------------------------------------

When I asked her values she states the following. :

""I dont want to be test ridden like a car"".

""If I am going to act like the wife, why not become the wife"".

""Its harder to just walk away when you are married"".

""I would feel less of my self if I was living with someone who did not marry me"".

""Marriage is great for taxes"".

Like this is some formula for a relationship, minus the love that would somehow fall into a good relationship.

I dont see any of this shit above.. I want basic love, love that would flourish into a normal sexual life, and progress into a strong relationship, then marriage.

I currently feel none of this and here is she talking about heavy, outdated formal dating. Dont get me wrong I like this girl, but every time she talks about this I drift further apart.

TL;DR:","  Girlfriend has strong traditional no sex/no cohabitation/no foreplay rules till marriage, has never had a solid relationship, wondering if traditional no sex/no cohabitation/no foreplay rules actually lead to marriage?","  Current (relationship novice) girlfriend is making me jump through all the traditional dating to marriage hoops like its some sort of magic formula for a successful marriage, I am not feeling any of this and see it as a receipt for disaster."

TITLE: I [25M] was using GFs [24] phone for gps and another guy was sending cutesy texts, now she wants space.

POST: Hey guys

So last weekend my gf and I went camping and we were using her phone to gps out of the woods back to her place. While I was plugging in directions her phone buzzed with a series of cutesy texts from her coworker (pic of his cat saying it misses her, pics of him and what he was doing that weekend). 

A little backstory.. I recently moved over 1k miles to take a summer job and it was a bonus because the job was closer to her, we were long distance for over 3 months and one night she frantically called me because she felt like she was emotionally cheating on me with this same guy. She said nothing happened he just tried to make moves on her while they were out with other coworkers, and she told him to keep it professional.

Fast forward a month after that and I see these texts, so I get a little upset and we talk about the relationship. She tells me she she's never done anything with him although she enjoys his company, and doesn't really respond to the texts. While we're talking she mentions that she's clueless about serious relationships (I'm the second longest at 7 months), is confused etc etc, and comes to the conclusion that she loves me but wants some space.

Now this was yesterday and today she's texted me that she still wants to try, but I can't help but think it'll feel like a forced relationship, or that she'll continue to not take the relationship seriously and I'll get hurt.

TL;DR:","  Was using GFs phone for gps, another guy was sending cute texts, GF now wants space. I'm worried it'll feel forced or that she'll continue to not take the relationship seriously.","  Relationship on the rocks because gf still talks to someone she ""emotionally cheated"" on me with, what do?"

TITLE: I passed the pre-employment polygraph, but I'm still worrying.

POST: Sorry for the wall of text!  This is, of course, a disposable account due to the sensitive nature of my dilemma.

I'm in the process of applying for a non-sworn position at the sheriff's department in my area.  I have gotten most of the way through the process, including having had my polygraph a couple of days ago.  I passed, which makes sense because I was truthful.

Here's the rub:  I revealed some information during that session, and I don't know if it will disqualify me from getting the job.  
I consider myself a generally good person- I'm no saint, but overall I don't think I've done anything too awful.  (BTW, I'm female, in my mid-30's.)

Here's the item I'm worried about:   15 or so years ago, in the Napster/Limewire days, I downloaded a file.  I don't remember what I was looking for- anyway, this file was named something innocuous and I had no idea what I was getting into.
Turned out it was child porn.  As soon as I realized what it was, I turned it off and deleted the file.  So, it wasn't deliberate, but it doesn't change the fact that I have seen (""viewed"") child porn.

I was honest about this in the polygraph, and I think my results reflected that I don't purposely watch anything like that.  I've also been much more careful on the Interwebs ever since.

The examiner told me that everything that we went over, will be included in her report to the department.  I really hope that this, or anything else I revealed (minor theft, experimented with pot years ago) doesn't disqualify me; I'm having a hard time not worrying about it.  The background check is next; I should pass that with no problem.

Does anyone have any words of advice?  I need to stop thinking about this!   Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:","  I passed a polygraph, revealed some information about possibly having viewed child porn years ago.  Still worried about it.  The background check is next.

TITLE: Need help with landlord and lease

POST: I have a question about a lease my roommates and I signed. We are living in a house off campus that is usually rented to college students. 

Our lease says in one section, "" Landlord agrees to furnish the following appliances, if any: 2 Stove, 2 Refrigerator, 1 Dishwasher, 1 washer/dryer, and A/C""

However, our house only has one stove and one fridge. I emailed the landlord company and asked them to provide the other kitchen with appliances since the lease says she should provide them for us. Her response is as follows: 

""Hi X,
There will not approve of any change in the lease terms and the rental amount.  I understand your lease states 2 refrigerators and 2 stoves.  But, the refrigerator and stove in the smaller kitchen was not purchased by _____ Properties, it was left by the previous tenants years ago.  Each year the new set of tenants agreed to keep the appliances but recently the appliances have been working, so that is why they were removed from the property... After the work is completed in the kitchen, I will see if we have any appliances (maybe a refrigerator) available at that time.  
Thank you,
Y""

I'm thinking, the landlord wrote the lease and we signed it without making any changes. Is this not materially complying with the terms of the contract? Since she wrote it, shouldn't it be construed against her (if it that clause is even ambiguous)? Is it a material eviction to not have the second kitchen working? There are six girls living in my house so we would really like to either have the fridge provided or the rent reduced by the amount of the replacement.

TL;DR:","  Landlord wrote lease saying she would provide the second kitchen with all the necessary kitchen equipment. However, the house only has one stove and one fridge. Is this not in compliance with the terms of the lease?",  Our lease says the landlord needs to provide us with two fridges and stoves but we only have one of each. Landlord won't give us the other two.

TITLE: Me [28 F] with my boyfriend [32 M] together 5 years: he's a dreamer who can't seem to get his act together, otherwise a good relationship but is it time to break it off?

POST: I've been with my partner for 5 years and we communicate really well and enjoy each other's company, but in this last year I've been wondering if this is actually workable for the long term.

While I'm not interested in marriage and kids, I am interested in building a life together and it seems challenging to do with him. Last year he quit his job because it was unfulfilling and I was supportive of him taking the time to find out what he wants to do. The year has gone by and it's hard not to notice that he hasn't made much progress. His biggest breakthrough has been that he wants to create art and doesn't care which means it takes to support himself. Even settling on a career in art wouldnt bother me, but he just wants to create art and is not interested in making a career out of it. Doesn't want any kind of career it seems, but I find myself embittered by how selfish that feels, because I work so many hours.

Long story short he just refuses to think about any practical parts of life, how to sustain a life financially (maybe because he is willing to get help from his parents when he needs it?). In the meantime, I want to be able to plan trips, live together, invest in a dog, etc. Every element that requires planning seems impossible. I get frustrated by the thought of everything falling on my shoulders, but I also appreciate the emotional support and distraction he provides me from my career-driven life. We've talked about these differences a lot but just keep hitting a dead end. We care about each other but also are not sure if we're too different.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend is a dreamer who can't seem to get his act together otherwise a good relationship but is it time to break it off?,  Are we just too different: Me a career-minded planner and him a free spirit? How do I decided whether it's time to break up after 5 years?

TITLE: Reddit, when did you realize that the world doesn't revolve around you?

POST: This problem seems more and more trivial every time I think about it. Now that finals are coming around, I keep thinking back to my freshman year in college. I had just bombed an exam and it was consuming my mind. It was all that I could think about, failing the class, ruining my GPA, hurting my odds of getting into a professional school. Shortly after my exam, I went to volunteer at a hospital nearby for the afternoon. It was a slow day, but eventually I got called to the maternity ward to discharge a patient. Most of the patients at this hospital, like the one I was wheeling out, were Hispanic and didn't speak very good English, but occasionally I would get a little small talk. On the way into the elevator she asked me how my day was, and with my thoughts on my exam, I said, ""alright."" ""Just alright?"" she asked. I explained to her how I was really worried about an exam I just took. She smiled and nodded understandingly. She asked me what college I went to and after I answered she said, ""Oh, I applied there last year, but I got pregnant so I had to withdraw."" I was thrown for a loop, she was about the same age as me. After she left with her parents, she tried to give me a tip. We weren't supposed to accept tips, but she insisted I take it, so via protocol, I took it and gave it to the office, and they added it to the student scholarship fund. When I returned the wheelchair to the nurse's station, I overheard them talking about the patient I just discharged. I commented on how nice she was. They filled me in on the rest of her story. She had just spent a month in the neonatal infant care unit because her baby was born premature, her healthcare wouldn't be able to cover most of the costs, the father of the baby had skipped out, and she was turning 19 next week. I was stunned. With so much on her plate, she had the courtesy to ask me about my day and without money to spare, she had insisted on giving me a tip.

TL;DR:","  In college, had an exam that consumed my mind, volunteer at a hospital, overheard nurse casually ask me about my day and give me a tip. When did you realize that the world doesn't revolve around you?","  I was a bitch about failing an exam.

Every time my ex breaks it off with me, I feel my world crashing over and this repeats itself where I can't get myself out of bed and call in sick from work. 

Each time we get back together, I truly believe that it will work out this next time. I would trust that he wanted a serious commitment. It would start out great, full of energy, love and affection. Then after this huge fight and a break, he said we should take a longer break to grow. He is afraid of missing out on life because he is young. That is his mentality. I would lash out by saying he just wants to hook up with multiple women. But we are both not the type for one night stands. 

I would fantasize about planning trips together, maybe even moving in with each other, etc. and he would rather say things where he doesn't mind living in another country for a year. That's the type of things he would say that would send me into so much hurt and anger. 

Throughout the relationship, I'd feel extremely insecure and anxiety because he was never sure in the end about us. This cause me to be crazy and lash out over little things and controlling.

TITLE: How to tell my (18F) SO of two years I(18M) used an escort (and regret it) but it has now made me never want to leave her?

POST: Some background: I've been having an existential crisis lately where I don't see any point of living other than to reproduce and die. (I don't want to put the burden of life onto someone else either!) I discussed it with my friends and came down to ""enjoy your time here while you can"", so I decided I'd focus on the things I love, which are videogames and sex.

 With my GF and I going to seperate colleges in a month, I figured that this would be the end and I would be able to finally get my sex life going and have some fun. (We will be 12hrs apart by car)

 So now that I'm overseas I thought I'd visit an erotic massage place and enjoy myself. I recieved unprotected fellatio for 20seconds before I suggested that she wrap it up. We then had protected intercourse. 

 It was not very enjoyable. It made me realize sex is not just about pleasing yourself or your partner but its about the special connection you share. I really regret not rubbing one out before I left that day.

 When I got home that night I realized I had betrayed my SO's trust and I cried thinking about it. How it would hurt her knowing I did this. I realized how special she is to me. (I'm tearing up as I write this.)

 I sent her a message that night telling her how much she meant to me and I would stay in a long distance relationship so that we could move in together and that I will stay loyal to her for four years. I meant it and I mean it forever, this experienced changed me for the better. I'm out of my existential crisis now, I realized that my purpose is in life is to build a great one with her, together.

 How can I break it to her? I'm a very honest person so I can't go on seeing her each day knowing I took advantage of her trust. I return to my country soon.

(And I'm going to get an STD test even though i show no symptoms, just in case)

POST: My boyfriend (23M) and I (20F) have been together for one year and seven months. We both have been cheated on in our past and vowed to never do that to one another.

In the beginning I could tell he was insecure and had trust issues from past relationships. I kept building him up and reassuring him. 

About seven months into our relationship he texted me under a new number pretending to be somebody else and I had responded to the flirtatious text. I had to regain trust in him and he was able to move forward. I have never cheated on him. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I have had a feeling things weren't right. We haven't been seeing eachother as much even though we talk everyday and profess our deep love for eachother daily. I saw his phone had texts from two different women that were very flirtatious and that he's seen them multiple times. 

I confronted him and he begged and pleaded for me back and to forgive him like he forgave me. He claims that I have been distant (even though I make time for him) and that hes scared of me moving an hour away for school. He also says he did not have sex with them although one text from one woman asked if she could still come over to his apartment later. 

I made him leave a voicemail to one who he claims was his ex that cheated on him. He told her to never text him or call him back as he messed up a valuable relationship. He says I'm the woman he wants to marry, the love of his life, and that they don't mean anything. How do I trust him? What do I do? I dont know what to believe.

My dad worked for a few production companies in London and often got to meet celebrities through work and as social friends. He managed to get tickets to go see a Pantomime in London which Ian McKellen was starring in as Widow Twankey. The show was a rendition of Aladdin.

After the show we got to go backstage to see the cast, and as a 10 year old I was super exited because I was going to see fucking Gandalf in person! Holy shit I was pumped! 

We get into the backstage area of the venue and inside a big dressing room where all the cast were getting out of their make up and costumes etc and sat down in the corner laughing away with Roger Allen was indeed Sir Ian McKellan, who was eating a[ Pot Noodle] on a saucer in a dressing gown and high heels (part of his show outfit)

My face lit up when I saw him, my dad walked me over to say hi and to sign the booklet about the show with his signature.

As my dad said who I was he stood up and said 'Ahhh!! Splendid to meet you young Mr_Murdoc!' But as he lent over to shake my hand I accidentally reached out for his and knock his Pot Noodle all over him and his dressing gown. He jumped with an 'oh my!' and began to wipe off all the noddles and sauce I just got all over him. All the other cast members were laughing like crazy.

He laughed it off as well and said it was alright and to give me the book so he could sign it. We ended up talking about some of the films he did and how I loved LOTR's and X-Men etc... Left with all their autographs which I still have (see below).

POST: It hurts very much every time he breaks up with me. This situation is taking a toll on me and I'd like to hear your thoughts about what's best to do.

Generally, this is what happens: we have an argument and it ends with him breaking up with me. He either goes completely silent or leaves the house for a few days while I am crying/begging him to stay. I know I shouldn't. Twice, I really thought it was over, had stopped all contact with him and he reached out to me.

Last week, right before a camping trip, he threatened to break up with me before the end of the Summer and acted like nothing happened the next morning, being super nice to me. I feel frustrated, because it's like I have to tiptoe around him, he gets angry very quickly, sometimes calls me names in the heat of the moment. He acts nice with me infront of his friends, but otherwise we rarely have one on one dates. I don't mind that he needs alone time since I need a lot of that myself, but it is annoying that he doesn't want to help out with house chores. Furthermore, we aren't sleeping in the same bed nor does he seem enthused to get intimate. For the last part, it might just be my impression since I don't know how I feel about that myself with everything that has happened. 

I don't know what to think: are relationships this messy and am I just making too big of a deal out of this?

Finally, I feel very vulnerable since my job contract ended unexpectedly about a month ago and maybe that puts more of a restrain on the relationship. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts about whether this relationship can be fixed or not. Feel free to ask questions if I left out some important details. Thank you for reading me.

A week ago Sunday I went out for a 4 mile run as I am currently in the middle of a 10k training program. I started the run with what felt like a tight left glute, but I wasn't concerned. By mile 3 I was feeling some pain in my left hip (nothing super concerning), but finished my 4 miles because it had taken a lot of mental fortitude and willpower to get out there that day and I wanted to finish.

I hobbled home and did some massage and stretching. Decided to rest up and heal. I skipped my scheduled Tuesday 3.5 mile, then the Thursday 2 mile, and now here I am going to skip my scheduled 4 mile run again because the pain hasn't really gone away. It's a dull, achey, pinching pain, maybe a 3 to 4 on the pain scale? Feels deep, but not in the actual joint itself.

I've never experienced a sports injury like this before, and so I'm here wondering when and if you would see a doctor about this. I'm kind of crabby, because my race is at the end of June and I really want to at least perform moderately well on my first 10k.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my friend [19 F] known her for a couple years. I like her

POST: So I've known this girl for a couple years (about 4) and day by day i realize she's everything I want in a girl. But I don't know what to do about it because I've never had a girlfriend before and never really been intimate with someone. 

We went to elementary together but didn't really talk much. Afterwards she moved and to another country and came back when we started 9th grade. 

we went to the same school through 9th - 12th grade. I liked her back then too but didn't realize it until now how much she means to me. 

When we still were in school we didn't really talk over the phone much because we hung out at school and some times in the weekend. The problem is that none of us texts a whole lot so communication is kinda weak now and I don't know how to tell her that i like her without risking our ""friendship"". Although it should be noted that she's a very kind and understanding person so I don't know what her reaction will be.

She's the kindest person in the world, she's funny and caring and is the only person who manages to make me genuinely happy without having to fake it.

Sorry if this sounded like a rant but I have so much going through my head while now knowing if she even cares about me.

Thanks for reading.

TITLE: Me [17M], Picking between long-time friend [17M], her [15F] sister, or her sister's [15F] friend

POST: I'm in Grade 12 at high school, staying for another year next year.  I don't get around and have had practically no relationships.

I have known a girl [17F, GR12] for 4 years.  Let's call her Jess.  We've always gotten along very well but have never been romantically involved.  She is really fun to be around.  I didn't really notice she was attractive until this year, (eh, big school).  I sit with her and a few others at lunch.

I'm in a class for a musical at my school. There are 79 students in the class, including crew and cast.  I am playing the male lead.

Jess' sister [15F, GR10] is in the class.  Let's call her Jill.  She is a nun in the musical. Not a major role, but she does have some solos.  I only met her in passing last year.  This year, I have gotten to know her better.  Whenever we talk, she seems to laugh at all my crappy jokes and might(?) be flirting with me.  She started conversations with me on FB.  She is really attractive.

Jill's friend [15F, GR10] is also a nun.  Let's call her Amanda.  I had never spoken a word to her until this year.  I like everything about her.  I try not to stare.  She has a beautiful singing voice, and may have been a female lead if she wasn't busy being a dancer (outside of school) as well.  We talk every day during class, and always seem to have fun around each other.

I want a serious relationship, I don't know who to pick.  Also, I can't pick one, get rejected, and go for a different girl.  Amanda would tell Jill if I asked her out first; Jess would tell Jill if I asked her out first; Jill would tell either if I asked her out first.  

Once (if) I decide I will post any updates.

TITLE: Update: Me [26f] wants to get back together with my ex [41m]

POST: Update: So the ex sent me a text last night saying that he didn't understand why I had an okcupid profile when I wanted to try and get back together with him, he said that it seemed like I was more ""lonely and sad"" and not a person sho was still in love with him. I created my profile about 2 weeks ago and haven't been on any dates, because he wasn't communicating with me; meanwhile he reactivated the account I met him through right after the break up, and has been on dates.

I tried to explain to him, that I haven't been using the account at all, and haven't  been on any dates, and I brought up the fact that he never deleted the account he had originally (we had talked about eventually getting hitched, so to me it seems like he kept the profile because he never planned on getting hitched). 

He is also convinced that I have narcissistic  personality disorder, which is devastating for me to hear. I have gone to my shrink about this, and my shrink said   no that I don't have this, and that it sounds like my ex is projecting. I told this all to my ex, in an attempt to open communication and to get him to drop this ""diagnosis"", and I even got a second opinion from a counselor that specializes in personality disorders,who also said that I don't have npd, though I do display signs of defaulting into co-dependent behaviours. Even though 2 medical professionals have said I don't have npd, my ex continues to say ""that's classic npd"" when I say something contrary to what he wants.

He is also, negating anything I say as lying, or thinking only of me, or of changing  the subject.  I know I'm not perfect, and I know I caused him a lot of pain, it's just so hard to try and apologize and fix things between us so that we can move on and rebuild, when he takes anything I say and twists it into the opposite of what I intended it to mean, and that when I try to explain in different ways he says I'm lying or back tracking

TITLE: Whats the worst that can happen?

POST: So tonight I walk back to my apartment defeated and utterly lack the will to live right now.
I'm an Intelligence Analyst for the Army National Guard. I hold a Top Secret Clearance. and Im 20.
I'm already on diversion because when I was sober, I drove a drunk friend home, who happened to have weed on him when I was driving him home, to then be pulled over by the police.
I'm on a 90 day diversion, 1 UA a month, everyday I call to see if my 'Color' is called to go take a breathalyser test. Tonight, I decided to have 2 shots with a friend (it takes alot to get me even buzzed) who is getting married in a week and I can't make it. Luckily enough, my other friend who was taking us to a place to meet other friends, got pulled over with an open container and breathalysed, and thrown in jail.
I (being the good natured, newly renewed Christian I am(couple months,trying to turn a new leaf)) told the officer what happened the whole night. 
explaining that I'd be totally F**ked if anything else happened to my record while on diversion. TS clearance- gone, ADOS job to pay bills - gone, and 1 of 2 other things would happen... A:I'd lose my clearance and HOPEFULLY be allowed to reclass to a different job, and owing the $20k, or B:Be kicked out of the military for not having the job they gave me, and still owe them $20k for the enlistment bonus.
Either way I look at it.. I'm fucked because doing the good thing and telling the cop I had something to drink and cooperating with him about the night.
So my question is.. Why shouldn't I leave the country and just travel the world and leave all my family and life behind to travel and read the bible......

TITLE: Me [20/M] with my girlfriend [20/F] 6 months, met girlfriend on night out she's with her (guy/girl) friends, she tells me to go back t0 my friends, blames me for not wanting to see her

POST: Ok so I go with my friends on a night out, girlfriend goes with hers (both are friendship groups have girls/boys in), I bump into her by accident early on in the night, we have small talk for a few minutes, both of us are laughing (having fun), then she tells me to go back to my friends. I haven't offended any of her friends or anything, there's nothing me or my friends have done wrong - just to get that straight.
'You should go back to your friends', I keep the conversation going, wanting to stay with her a bit longer, replying 'yeah in 5 minutes (etc. etc.)'. Eventually I just go back, respecting what she told me to do and not wanting to question her in front of friends (I always avoid getting friends involved in disagreements with relationships - we both do).

On top of this she has introduced me to her friends like once - I always respect peoples privacy and keeping friendships separate, but when my girlfriend doesn't want me top hang around with her and her friends, feel devalued by her.

At the end of the night, I question why, apparently it's my fault as she didn't think I wanted to see her. I make it clear that she was the one who told me to go back to my friends.

We've also had an issue with meeting each others friends too, she has met all of mine, knows them well etc. But I have barely met hers. I told her a couple of weeks ago, that I wanted to meet her friends. She told me that she would let me meet them etc. etc. It's not like it would be hard for me to meet them - she hangs out with them all the time.

Opinions on why she is doing this? Where do I go from here?

Everyone just looks out for themselves. I'm tired of it. People are greedy and will pretend to care just to get what they want. 
It's been this way my whole life it seems. This is why I shut down and close myself off from people. 

I'm not so jaded as to cut myself off from everyone forever, but I'm going to be more careful. And I AM going to take a few days for myself. I'm going to be ""selfish"" for a 2 or 3 days and not bother with anyone. Cut off communication for the most par. Just kind of whatever. 

I keep falling into the same trap. Though this time it wasn't as harsh as previous times and didn't last as long. It only being ""online people"" that I haven't known long makes it better in some ways but makes me feel a bit more dumb for putting myself out there like I did. 

People just don't give a shit. Greed rules over all.

TITLE: Friend [30M] and I [25F] have feelings for each other but he has someone else. How can I deal with this and not feel envious?

POST: Well, he and I have told each other we have feelings for each other but he's sleeping with someone else and still is. I don't want this type of relationship. But I see him very frequently and I see him with her frequently as well. Every time I see them together I feel really sad. I go along fine and happy because I don't see that very often but when I do it's ouch! 

I have distractions and hobbies and such, and no I can't go no contact as I have many parallel things that I have to do with him. 

I've had as little contact as I could with him, not talking much and only about things we have to communicate with. He has no social media which is good. 

I'm not so much jealous but more envious of the closeness and how he shares his life and stories with her. We used to be like that and this happened, and I've tried to still be friends but my feelings got in the way. It doesn't seem to be bothering him outwardly, which kind of hurts. Because of that I went to as little contact as possible. He did ask me if I hated him and wondered if we were still friends. 

I would like to balance between being the friends we used to be and not being envious over his relationship. I don't know if this going to as little contact as possible is something that is a mature thing to do, and if I've hurt him if he has to wonder if I hated him. I really would like to resume our old friendship, I loved it, but hate the envy and sadness I get now. Any advice would be great. Thanks!

TITLE: Need advice on cheating.

POST: Alright some back information, I'm 18 female I've been in a few really great relationships with some really great girls! I'm currently in one (it's been 2 months) and I have to say I couldn't be happier. My girlfriend is the greatest thing I could ever ask for and more than I'd ever expect from a person. I'm not unhappy at all, not bored at all (of the sex either.. that's just.. amazing), I have no issues really with the relationship and how it is!

That being said.. why do I think about cheating? I know I have a really *really* high sex drive, but hers is rather high as well. It works out great, and I can't complain at all about what/how she does. 

I just have always, in every relationship, felt an urge to cheat. Not to end my relationship, but because *I know* that it's bad. That's why I want to do it? I'm just looking for opinions here, maybe someone else faces the same thoughts? I have dreams that I can control and I'll dream of my girlfriend all the time but some nights I'll cheat in my dreams. There's just this feeling that hits me where it's like.. ""yeah.. I'd do that. It's bad.. but I want to.""
As a side note maybe, it's always been part of my ""fantasies"" to do bad things. (sex with a teacher..coach..married woman..someone else cheating with me) Maybe I'm just attracted to the bad things?

TITLE: Hey Reddit, I have the opportunity to retaliate against someone who has wronged me. What should I do?

POST: Earlier this week, something of extremely high value went missing from one of our work facilities. I used an e-mail to make a public announcement that it was missing and I was looking for it. Today, I discovered hard and undeniable evidence of who had last seen/touched my property.

When I asked the culprit in a casual and non-confrontational manner, he denied ever seeing it and said that he ""feels my pain"". Then I informed them of the evidence against them, and he admitting to having taken it.This made him visibly nervous. I told him I don't care why he did it, and I just wanted my property back. At this time I am the only person that knows he is the culprit, and I told him that I would keep it that way as long as he immediately did what I ask. 

But now I am having second thoughts. This guy knew exactly what he was doing to me when he took my stuff, because I straightforward told him the repercussions of my loss. For lack of better words, he completely fucked me. Then he had the audacity to look directly into my face and say that he didn't have it, but he felt bad for me. Obviously he didn't feel the need to worry about my problems, and I don't see why I should care about his problems. 

This is someone I see every day. We have the same professional network, peers, and superiors. Basically, all I would have to do is let any of our colleagues know the identity of our department's thief. I am a well-liked and respected member of this ""community"", and somebody that tried to screw me would instantly be outcast. I think that this is fair punishment for the amount of stress and anguish that was caused to me, but that's just my opinion.

TITLE: My(22F) mentally unstable friend(24F) wants to have a baby ASAP. Should I talk to her? (x-post relationships)

POST: My friend Danielle was engaged for 4 years in what I can only describe as an extremely toxic relationship (gaslighting and cheating galore in both directions). She finally broke up with him a little under a year ago, and quickly began dating someone new. I have only met the new guy (Mark) a couple of times, but they seem like a far better fit and like they are happy together.

Recently Danielle told me that she wants to get pregnant in the next few months. I didn't say anything about this at the time, but there are a few reasons why I think this would be a bad idea.

Firstly (and least significantly), her and Mark have only been together for about 5 months, and she started dating him really soon after she broke up with her fiance.

Secondly, she isn't mentally stable. I'm not entirely sure what she has been diagnosed with, but it is something like borderline personality disorder or extreme depression. This manifests itself in the form of panic attacks, neurosis, depression and narcissism. She claims that she cannot afford medication, even though we live in a country where prescriptions are incredibly cheap, and you can get free repeat prescriptions. Her not being medicated has led to her being fired or quitting her last few jobs.
I don't think she realises just how expensive and mentally draining having a child can be. I think it's important that she focuses on getting well before considering having children. I don't think it would be fair to bring up a child in the environment that she can currently offer it.

Should I talk to her about my concerns, or would I be massively out of line for doing so? I'm not sure that she would react well or take what I say on board. I know another of my friends agrees with me, and would probably have another point or two to add, so I could potentially have back up if I were to talk to her. I love this girl and want what's best for her. We have been good friends for about 10 years now.

TITLE: My dress finding story.

POST: So I did a thing today. (I post the pictures earlier today)

About a month ago I was coming home from Therapy and feeling crappy and me and my mum went to a wedding dress shop (the one that used to be renaissance) . We just tried on some dresses. As you can guess they were big and poofy and they were all nice but they were all missing something. 

So my mum got me to try on one and I'm like it fits my criteria (princess sparkerly and strapless) but it had some detail that I didn't like. Anyway I tried it on and fell in love. It was beautiful. It was a stock dress so I could have it for £800 (which is my budget) ultimately we said no. 

So I've been thinking about it a lot and my mum said we could go back and look. I said it'll never be there, cause it was a stock dress and I couldn't afford it otherwise. 

We went in and the women recognised us. She was with another client. We said we were back to see if she still had the dress. She said she did! And the other girl had put it in her top three!!! In the end the other girl decided against that dress and left without buying one. 

I tried it on again and it was still perfect (I've actually lost boob weight since I last had it on. But the woman assured us it's able to be altered and it's the size that she would give me) 

I lamented that I hadn't gone shopping with Out my bridesmaids. And she said that I could bring them all in so they could see me in it. Which I totally want to do cause.....

I brought the dress!!!! I have a wedding dress and this feels more real than putting the deposit down on the venue. 

Sitting here listening to mine and FH love playlist. (That includes such romantic songs as Roxanne by The Police) It's strange though cause I look at the pictures online and I hate the dress and I'm not fond of the pictures of me. But in the mirror and on I feel like the prettiest princess that ever lived. 

Have fun wedding dress hunting.

TL;DR:",  Went to a dress shop trying on dresses. Found one that fit my criteria but it had some detail I didn't like. Went back and tried it on and fell in love with it.

POST: Link to original post (sorry its long, I'm on mobile): 

So not just 20 minutes ago I had her in my arms, we were enjoying our show that we are watching together (white collar, 10/10 would recommend if you haven't watched it). The episode we are on ends, and I then I stop it from auto switching to the next episode like I always do so we can either decide to talk or watch another episode. I had literally completed this short task, and began to turn my head like I was going to talk with her (although this time I was going to kiss her), when she announced that she better be going. She said she had more studying to do for finals and wants to get to bed early (completely understandable, it IS finals week).

So that obviously threw me off from kissing her. But in a last effort, I asked her to stay for just a few minutes to talk, which we normally do before she goes anyway, but she insisted that she really did need to go. So no kiss tonight.

Here is where I need advice again. We only have this week till we will be away from each other for winter break. We don't know if we will be able to meet up once more or not. So what do I do, hope for the best? Hope we can meet up one more time, and if not, just leave it? Meet her right before she leaves for break, give her a kiss to think on? Should I try and call and talk to her tonight or another day this week? Should I just give up and not get my hopes up?

Near the end of term, she wanted to give me a hug. As she closed in on me, I turned around and walked away. I later wrote a letter to her asking her not to talk to me and to leave me alone.

As I've gotten older, that letter and my actions make me ashamed of myself. I never apologized to her or even looked at her for the next 2 years.

Well, we met on reddit. We facebooked, PM'd skyped, texted, everything. We talked almost all day everyday. I loved him and he loved me. He was the only person I trusted enough to tell everything to (self-esteem/body image/ depression issues), he was the only one to make me feel happy. He would always tell me that I was it for him. That he wanted to marry me and I was his soul-mate. 

Well, we broke up. He told me he would fight for me and that he'd make me trust him again, but he never did. Instead he ""fell for"" my now ex-best friend. Less than a week after we broke up. He's already moved on and I'm miserable wishing that we could be back together. Now I feel worthless and like I meant nothing to him. That our year meant nothing to him. 

It's like being treated like crap for all your life, then suddenly finding that one person who treats you like a queen or goddess. Then, having that person stomp on you then wiping you off of their shoes like the piece of crap you truly are. 

How do I move on from this?

TL;DR:",  First love/first heartbreak. Ex-bf of close to 1 year moved on and stomped on me then moved on. Feeling worthless and like I meant nothing to him. How do I move on?,  Ex-BF (first love) told me I was his soulmate. Now he wants my friend. I feel completely worthless and I have no idea how to move on.

TITLE: I'm only 20, but a rocky, abnormal start to relationships has left me jaded. What do?

POST: (20, Male, University, busy with academic work and a couple of hobbies, good friendship circle etc.)

It's really hard to describe my feelings towards relationships. I've had plenty of crushes, have acted on them, and have been turned down or used emotionally (I was very naive at the start of university). Now, this isn't going to be some pity-party. That'd be silly. But I must admit that the prospect of relationships is kind of drifting out of my head as a possibility. To me this seems perfectly logical - if the only thing I've experienced has been, at most, girls who really can't decide whether they like me 'in that way' or not, then why would I see things any other way?

But here's the kicker. I know plenty of people drift quite seamlessly into relationships, even if these opportunities are rare. I know they're quite simple and straightforward, but my past experiences have left me quite jaded and cynical to the possibility of this being true.

I'm not a virgin, and have had a couple of flings earlier in university. When I lost my virginity, it was enjoyable (in a 'finally!' kind of way), but ultimately embarrassing (including her telling me I'm 'weird', then sort of kicking me out of her flat (have no idea what I did wrong...)); and I guess I kind of have a negative experience. The second fling was a bit messed up too (was with a long-time friend), but far more enjoyable/awesome - only her being 'on the fence' made everything really awkward after the fact.

What I'm trying to get at is, I have yet to actually have any kind of decent, 'normal', genuinely nice sexual relationship. Coupled with some memories I'd rather forget, I am left probably worse off than having no experience at all.

I'm sure all of this doubt will kinda vanish once I'm actually *there*, *in* a relationship and I get to find out what the fuss is all about, but naturally, the process of getting there (e.g. meeting new people, and so on) is made harder by a really rocky start to relationships.

TL;DR:","  20, male, University student, has had a rocky start to relationships, and has yet to have any kind of decent, normal, genuinely nice sexual relationship. Feeling pretty jaded about relationships now. What do?",  Bad sexual experiences make me in a worse position than I would be without any experiences at all - this makes me cynical about what a 'true' relationship would be like. What do?

TITLE: I [24/m] feel guilty I did something and wonder if/when I should tell her [20/f]

POST: I've very recently started dating this girl - boyfriend/girlfriend wouldn't even be accurate labels. About a month ago I took her out for a date and it was quiet, though it seemed it went quite well (this has since been confirmed).

I soon asked her out again, but she didn't get back to me for some time. I thought this was her shy way of letting me down gently; I've been turned down that way before and failed to recognize it the first time, being quite the socially unaware fool. I felt dumb for not being able to evaluate such an obvious thing and thinking she'd been interested in me - it'd be good to mention I'd had a change in anti-depressants at the time, so my mood was all sorts of whack.

I fell back into a depressive slump for about a week. This passed and I started considering asking her out one more time in person to see if my impression were reality or due only to poor self-esteem.

But, after failing to work up the nerve for that, I sexted a random girl online, had some fun, and then I found my courage the day after and asked for a second date. We set something up, and we've been on a few more since then.

The issue is the guilt has set in and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to confess it at some point - not now, we're not that deep into a relationship, but in the future. I understand the general consensus: it's not an issue, technically I'm single, it's not like we'd yet explicitly discussed an exclusive status, dating multiple people isn't unacceptable in the very beginning, etc. etc. But those thoughts aren't who I am, and she's a sweet, shy girl so I suspect it's not who she is either.

TL;DR:","  Recently started dating a girl, sexted random girl online, feel guilty about it and don't know whether to confess it to her now or in the future.","  Sexted a random girl online a couple weeks after the first date but before the second, feel guilty, I want some perspective, and I wish someone would agree that what I did is at least a little wrong."

TITLE: TIFU by winning the raffle.

POST: This happened back in Highschool. Grade 10, to be exact; I'm Canadian, so that should be 16? Anyways, I was in PhysEd when our gym teacher gave us raffle tickets and told us to sell them.

Well, I procrastinated hard, to the point that I didn't try selling anything in the two weeks, until just the night before. I started freaking out, and after managing to sell half my lot, I said ""Screw it, I tried."" Well, just before giving the remaining tickets, and money to the teacher, I got nervous, so I bought three more tickets. ($2 a pop)

The next day is the day of the Highschool basketball game. I don't care for it, so I head home. I come back the next day and all my classmates are giving me dead pan stares. The teacher stares through my soul and in the most serious voice, he asks, ""Where were you yesterday?"" I'm confused, and told him the truth.

I find out that of the three prizes, I won two. The first being courtside seats on a freaking couch they pushed into the gym, as well as a private box of pizza and sodas for myself and one friend. Second prize was an authentic, Vince Carter signed basketball.

I lost the couch prize, but the teacher saved the ball for me. The entire class was pissed, and the teacher just exclaims, ""You're fucking lucky as hell, you know that?"" (He was a chill dude)

I was leaving the school, and was about to tear apart the packaging to play with the basketball, when the same teacher and a few others exclaimed and ran to me. They started having a betting war right in front of me. The price went as high as $100.
I declined the offers, and just took the ball home and showed my parents. They offered to keep it stored.

I didn't want to, I know Vince Carter would have wanted me to play with it, but when everyone makes a big deal about it, what can you do as a kid? I'll take a picture of the ball when I can, it's still with my parents. I've moved out when I married.

TL;DR:","  I won a basketball signed by the great Vince Carter at Highschool. Everyone was pissed and a betting war ensued. I declined offers to keep it, and took it home with my parents.","  I cheated and ended up winning the majority of the prizes, getting pretty much everyone mad at me. I now have a sweet basketball."

POST: * Hi everyone, myself A (23) met N (22) while we were both traveling overseas in South America. A from NZ and N from Eygpt. We hit it off incredibly well and spent the next few weeks travelling together. It was a very intense and passionate albeit short experience. That is a year ago, since then we constantly have talked and skyped with each other. I haven't been able to get her off my mind, and nor her me - so she says.

* We both agreed that as hard as it is we both do want each other to be happy and we would try to be happy for each of us to date someone. As we previously established long distance was never going to be a real possibility. We both looked into making the move and it seemed unlikely -  we both had plans. My plans fell through due to various reasons and now the plans I did have are not there anymore.

* Recently, N just got into a relationship with someone and I didn't realise how much it would affect me. I haven't been sleeping right, it's all I can think about. We have talked about it a few times but it is difficult. I don't know if I am confusing my emotions but all I want to do is head over and be with her now. I proposed this idea to her and she seems kind of willing but hesitant for that it may not work out, that she just started going out with someone, what happens when I have to leave it might make things harder etc.

POST: Yes, I know this may be the wrong place to post, and that there's one specifically designed for teenagers. But hang on a second. This is a series of messages we've been sending back and forth.

Me: Hey, next weekend, would you like to go out with me? Or if you're not free, the weekend after? :)

Her, the day after: I'm so sorry I just saw this now but yes I'd love to! I should be free x :))

Me: Alright, sounds great :) x how about [location] on Saturday?

Her: Sounds like an awesome plan:)

Me: Okay, cool. Can I pick you up at yours? And at what time?

*no response*

Me, a day later: So are you still up for [location] on Saturday?

Her: Of course I'm still up for it <3

Me: I'd like to pick you up at yours, if that's alright -- what time should I pick you up? X

*no response*

Now, at this point, I realised that I might have been a bit forward, asking to go to hers on the first date (the idea being I'd get her flowers). Fair enough.

Me, two days later: Hey, if you still want to go -- how about meeting at [different location] instead of at yours? x

*No response*

Me, on the morning we were supposed to go out: Oh, okay. Nevermind :/

Now, the last couple of messages weren't read at all by her, so it could be that she just wasn't available. But hang on a minute, she's been posting quite a bit on social media during the time, so what's that all about?

Also, this is completely different to what's been going on previously, where we would be talking regularly and often. So this is quite decisively against her normal behaviours. What's going on?

TITLE: 28 [F]: No butterflies when meeting 34 [M]. Confused.

POST: I [28/F] met this guy [34/M] the other day for the first time after talking for almost a month. We met online, and clicked instantly. Since then we talked on the phone almost every night and slowly grew to really like each other. When we met for the first time, I felt no butterflies... just an instant comfort feeling. I didn't feel like that intense, nervous, immediate infatuation. We did end up having sex, and the entire time we were together, he just kept remarking on how ""good different"" everything was. 
I'm very confused. I purposely searched for guys that are not my type: passionate ""bad boys"" who party a lot. I've had a string of tumultuous relationships where the guy idolized me, fell in love with the idea of me, and once I fell from that pedestal it all crashed and burned. But, he's different. Very different...

TITLE: My (28f) boyfriend (29m) very rarely will reciprocate oral sex to me despite my efforts to talk about it

POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now and I would consider us to have a healthy relationship EXCEPT that he does not meet any of my needs sexually. Both orally and otherwise. 
But my biggest issue is oral because the thing is that I go down on him on average about once a day. No joke or exaggeration, sometimes I do it more. And I enjoy doing it for him, truly, which is why I continue even though I don't feel like I should until I start to get more action from him. 
Now, I've tried talking to him about it in numerous ways. I've gently asked what he would do to my pussy next time he goes down on me, and other gentle applications of the subject. I've tried flat out asking him why he doesn't go down more often. I've asked if it has anything to do with my hygiene, tried offering ways to change anything I'm doing, and I'm always met with that he ""loves"" going down on me and that my lady parts are ""totally clean"" and then what happens? We get frisky and he has me go down on him and then I get nothing. And if I bring it up that moment he gets defensive and says things like ""sorry I'm not a better lover for you"" when he has the chance to be right then! But doesn't take it.

What can I do to change this?,  my boyfriend very rarely goes down on me and I have tried in my opinion very mature tactics to get it back with no avail. And I'm getting desperate for a way to get through to him!

TITLE: My [21 M] girlfriend [19 F] of almost 5 months didn't get me a birthday gift? Is it unreasonable of me to be upset?

POST: I've been dating a girl at my college for almost the past five months now.

My birthday was two weeks ago, during our spring break. Before we left for the break (she came to my hometown for a few days), she told me she was getting me a gift, but that for some reason, she likely wouldn't have it by my actual birthday. I figured it was being shipped or something and told her that was no big deal, and that I was just happy that she was getting me a gift. 

On my birthday, we went out for a nice little brunch at a French Restaurant to celebrate. After the meal, I thought we would split the check – which is what we normally do on dates – but she said she would pick it up. I thanked her and she wished me happy birthday. We spent the rest of the day together after that, went to an art gallery, etc. It was a really nice day.

But since then, there's been nothing on the gift front, not even a nice card. I realize that she may have ""gifted"" me the meal on my birthday, but if that's the case, I guess I'd say I'm not thrilled. After all the meal was like $30 total, and $15 isn't *that* much more than it would have cost in a split of one of our weekly dates.

I would have probably broached the subject already, but there are a few reasons I haven't yet. First off, this past week has been really stressful for my girlfriend, and I don't want to add more to her plate. Further, she's also been pretty financially strapped lately, and it would be pretty awful of me to ask her to spend more money. 

What do you think reddit? Am I being unreasonable? How can I handle this in a way that is delicate but also effective? Should I wait until she gets another paycheck?

TITLE: Was what Penny Arcade did to Paul Christoforo the right thing to do?

POST: I guess I'm taking a pretty big risk with my account reputation here...

I just felt like I had to ask the question. I, like everybody else, think Ocean Marketting's PR stallion is a class-A asshat, and I understand that Paul was *particularly* stupid in acting that way towards Mike Krahulik, but I can't convince myself that Mike acted in the right here.

Penny Arcade, and Mike Krahulik through it, command IMMENSE authority with the internet and the entire gaming community--so much so that I feel it could threaten to spread into other realms of this guy's life. Mike decided to power up the internet hate machine, and [some are already starting to feel the backlash.] As Dave observed many times in the original email chain, the Avenger is a fantastic controller, and now the product's sales are going to be affected by misguided hatred.

That controller was originally designed for the disabled. Is Ocean Marketing responsible for their new product's infamy because they had one awful, reckless marketer associated with it? Moreover, is there the possibility of Paul's actual life (read: not INTERNET life, like the rest of us) becoming endangered because of this and mob mentality? As Facebook, MySpace and Twitter prove to us, his identity and face are no secret, and there are now many, many, MANY people who dislike Paul Christoforo.

Later that night when I got board looking at the main apps I started diving down into Apple's bloatware. Apps like passport, news stand, game center and of course, Voice Memos.

TITLE: TIFU by drinking coffee

POST: This happened 12 years ago--I was 14. I was in the 8th grade, and before I left for school that morning I decided to have myself some coffee. I never really drank it before then, but thought, why not? Well, with my mom yelling that my siblings and I were going to miss our bus if we didn't hurry, I grabbed that big-ass cup of coffee I poured and chugged it like there was no tomorrow. Roughly four hours later (about 10 a.m.), my stomach is killing me--at this point, I am certain that a good vom session is imminent. I tell my teacher that I'm going to be sick and haul ass to the restroom (thankfully it was unoccupied). I rush into one of the stalls, get down on my knees, flip up the toilet seat, and take aim thinking I am about to barf like the Dickens at any second. Instead, I let out the wettest fart of my life, which coincided with an awful ass-plosion. Yes, I did not vomit--I shat my pants. And let me tell you, I shatt'em bad. My only reprieve was that I was still wearing briefs and hadn't yet switched to boxers. In shame and terror, I eked my way to the nurses office and told her I was sick (I actually just told her I vomited up a storm, rather than admit the truth). She calls my teacher to tell her I am going home; my mom arrived with 20 minutes or so to pick me up. (By the grace of God there was no stank or leakage). I walk upstairs to my bedroom, legs tightly clenched, and proceed to carefully remove pants and underwear; I stuffed all evidence into an old pillow, which I tossed into the garbage and immediately emptied. I cleaned myself up, took a nap and didn't take a single sip of coffee for a long, long time. To this day, the smell of coffee makes my sphincter wince.

TITLE: Quit drinking - no weight loss?

POST: So, I gained approximately 30-40 lbs after turning 21 - just the past year and 8 months. I would say a good deal of that came from drinking and the drunk eating. Additionally, I moved off campus for my senior year and found it easier to eat out or grab fast food for lunch and dinner rather than cook for myself or go to the dining hall on campus as I did my first three years. During my last semester of college I was easily drinking every day. Typically Sunday-Wednesday were ""light"" nights varying 2-4 beers, with Thursday-Saturday being heavy nights where I may have 8-10 drinks or more in a night. After graduating in early, I have drank maybe 3 times total and each time it was only a glass or two of wine. I've also been more responsible about not eating out (though still not perfect) and exercising.

Now, I'm wondering why I haven't seen any weight loss. I've been trying to take the ""Ease into it"" approach, but it seems like even just cutting drinking I should be losing weight. Beyond that, no late night taco bell and mcdonalds runs, or pizza/pasta for dinner every night should be showing on the scale too right?

TITLE: How do I [20F] manage this possibly-mutual crush on a coworker [19M]?

POST: 6 months ago I started working in the back of a restaurant twice a week to make some extra money.  I'm the only female in a staff of all males, and I've developed a crush on one of the boys I work with.  This is all sorts of inconvenient and when I first started liking him I figured I would try to get over it quickly since I don't really believe in mixing work and play.

Well, that was months ago, and since then the boy and I have managed to become quite close.  We go out after work with other coworkers, play video games together, and text a few times a week.  Definitely not best friends, but we sometimes joke about being bros.

Recently he's been way more flirty than usual (me being the only girl in a kitchen full of 18 year old boys inevitably leads to some flirting regardless) and asked to hang out alone once he returns from vacation after Christmas.  I would really love to do this and would love for this to mean he likes me, too, but am afraid to say something because 

a) if he does like me back, I'm not sure it's appropriate to be involved with a coworker (even though there are a few other boys in the kitchen who are dating female servers) 

b) if he doesn't like me back not only do I risk losing our friendship by letting him know I like him, but he might tell some of our other coworkers and the whole work environment could get quite awkward.

So do I let him know I like him?  Do I keep quiet about it and try to make it go away?  Do I wait and see how hanging out alone goes?  I feel slightly dumb about this because I'm very good at being direct with boys, but since he's a coworker I don't know how to handle this and I'm starting to like him A LOT.

We went out to the football field to practice for the contest, and as I got there, I had realized I had forgotten my marching shoes. Our director was coming out onto the field, so, in the panic I was in, I decided I had no choice but to take my shoes and socks off and go barefoot.

Everyone was either amused or horrified by my decision.
I did this for 20 minutes. I could not feel my feet at all after a while. When I couldn't stand it any more, I asked my director if I could just wear my non-suitable shoes. He was angry at my forgetfulness, but when he saw my multi-colored feet, he felt pity for me and let me wear them.

Since we have papers saying everything is OK he can't make any claims, I assume? Might want to add that he didn't ask ANY questions during the whole etat de lieux, basically walked around the flat and we followed him...but he never asked any questions, at all.

He claimed his flat back without proper notice too (email instead of registered mail) and we left within 5 weeks, so we made it easy for him to come back to France after getting himself fired in the US for something stupid and losing his work visa.

He didn't ask for any money yet but I'd like to be prepared in case this comes up. I'm a tad sad since, for once in my life, I tried to help others even tho it doesn't benefit me at all...and bam, we're running into such issues.

Thanks for your advice!

TL;DR:","  Landlord claims flat is broken after moving out, papers clearly say everything is fine, no damages reported at all, would like to be prepared in case this comes up.","  checkout papers are stating no damages, landlord now claims the bed is broken. Can he make any claims? KKTHXBYE! :D"

TITLE: My younger brother is getting bullied and has become anti social, I need advice on how to break him out of his shell again.

POST: I am eight years older than my brother, I'm in my mid twenties and he's just a teenager, but recently he has been getting picked on a lot in school. He's always been a really strict rule follower and if kids tried to cheat or skip class he would tell them not to, and I'm assuming he would tell the teacher. I'm not sure if it's because he has a learning disability, but he has had a hard time realizing that he is losing friends because of it. He has started getting picked on because of his height and weight even though he is quite skinny. 

To try and help him feel more comfortable in his own skin I've been helping him eat better and start weight lifting (I have a bachelor's of science in exercise physiology and a minor in nutrition). While he's become more confident physically, he still struggles making friends and understanding how to fit in. I've had him come with me to social activities, but there is only so much I can do because of the age gap. 

Sorry that this is such a long brick of text. But

TITLE: Me [17M] trying to be as best as possible to my anxiety prone [15F] girlfriend .

POST: I just recently started dating Penelope, who is two grades behind me. We met at our highschool during choir and musical; and, as youthful relationships typically begin, we are just wild about eachother.

My question is dual-faceted but I extend it to /r/relationships with the idea generally being that I am making an honest attempt to cross the schema gap to be the best boyfriend I can be.

First and foremost, the most obvious difference between us is our age disparity of two years. This isn't a huge problem between us, but might be an issue in the future, (parents raising eyebrows, peers being skiddish, etc.) So, what are my ethical obligations to her, (being the older of the two,) how can I traverse the two-year gap so that we have more common ground, and what do I do about negative societal judgement?

The second factor contributing to my ignorance is that Penelope happens to have pretty bad social anxiety. She arbitrarily experiences episodes where she believes that I'm lying and that the relationship isn't real, and has difficulties talking about the way she feels. She experiences occasional anxiety attacks as well. Her anxiety isn't advanced enough for me to consider it a serious hindrance to our relationship, I knew her for a couple months with that knowledge before making the decision to move forward into a romantic relationship. What can I do to make her feel less embarrassed about her anxiety when it strikes? As somebody who does not experience the same issue, what should I know to be more educated and empathetic going forward?

TL;DR:","  Me and my anxious girlfriend are two years apart in age, and she has social anxiety. What can I do to make her feel less embarrassed about her anxiety when it strikes?","  New girlfriend is two years younger, (a decent gap because we're still in highschool,) and experiences strong anxiety. What should I know, and what should I do in these regards to improve our relationship in the future?"

TITLE: I (23F) struggling to breakup with my boyfriend (28M) due to his panic attacks

POST: I don't believe in staying with someone because of a health reason. 

My boyfriend who is a lovely person, but not the right fit for me in the long run due to various reasons including different interests and him seemingly forgetting to put effort into our relationship has panic attacks. 

He shares a very personal story which I greatly appreciated him trusting me with about how when the last girl he was seriously seeing ended things with him, he had a panic attack and ended up in the ER. He had to take a week off of work and had a very difficult time, eventually getting a psychologist. 

He has since stopped going to the psychologist.

I do not see things going well with him. I'm bored with the relationship and were about to enter long distance which I'm just not down for. It was suppose to be our last night together and he fell asleep early. By chance I ended up staying in the city but I was so fed up by the end of that night I decided it was over. 

I am extremely worried about breaking up with him. It's not that I think I am his God given world or anything like that at all. For all I know he could want to breakup too. 

We previously got in a large fight when we were drunk and I broke up with him. He said some extremely mean things about my health and I got up and said this is not what I need. 

He broke down crying and couldn't breathe on his bed. I ended up staying the night and calming him down. 

Things got better since but I can't see this relationship lasting forever and I don't think it's fair to stay with him.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? 

I'm his first serious girlfriend in 8 years and the first girl ever to meet his family. 

The last girl he had a breakdown over was a FwB who he said he fell in love with. 

I've made him promise before that if we did breakup and he got sick, he had to let me know if he wanted and I would want to help him. I do not want to see him suffer and he knows this.

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend has panic attacks and I'm not sure if I should stay with him or break up with him. I'm afraid he will suffer and I don't think the relationship is worth it. What should I do?,  boyfriend previously had massive breakdown post last girl he was seeing. I'm the first girl he's seriously seen since and when we talked previously after drinking he had a breakdown. I don't know how to do this.

TITLE: Me [23/F] having trouble accepting my BF's [23/M] religious beliefs

POST: Today after a conversation about religion, my SO of two years told me he sometimes worries that I think his beliefs are 'silly'. I didn't want to sound like an asshole and said that while I didn't share the same beliefs as him, that didn't mean that he's 'silly' to believe. 

...But honestly, as an atheist I try to put the idea that he believes in a god at the back of my mind because it's only once in a blue moon we talk about religion (he would never bring it up, he accepts completely the fact that I'm not religious) and it's something that I have a hard time accepting and it's the only aspect of our relationship that I just avoid talking about.

He then said he sometimes thinks that if I could change one thing about him, it would be his beliefs. I didn't really know what to say to this and sorta fobbed him off, not making eye-contact and said I love him the way he is (which is true).

**My question is: Does it make me a bad person to admit that of COURSE I would change this about him if I could?** We were discussing the idea of what happens after death - I had said I couldn't think of anything more terrifying than continuing to exist for eternity while he said he couldn't think of anything worse than ceasing to exist - which completely baffles me and for the first time I realised that our views are polar opposites and will most likely stay that way. He believes there's something more than just chemistry that makes him 'him' and that he wouldn't want this to just end after death.

I feel like a horrible person for admitting to myself that there's something about him that I'd like to change, while he's perfectly happy accepting the fact that I'll never hold any religious beliefs..

TL;DR:",  BF of two years has religious beliefs that are completely opposite to mine and I'm having trouble accepting them. Am I a bad person for admitting that I'd like to change them?,  SO is religious and I'm not - does it make me a bad gf to want to change this if I could?*

TITLE: Meeting my [21F] boyfriend's [20M] parents for the first time. Dating for 3 months, friends for about a year. Should I bring a baked good?

POST: So, for Thanksgiving break, originally my boyfriend and I planned on driving down to his hometown, and then I would fly to mine soon after. It worked out because his hometown is on the way to mine, and he lives in a city so there is an airport.

When his parents found out, then asked him if they could meet me (I've never met his parents, been dating for 3 months). They said I could visit and sleep on the couch for a few hours before my flight instead of sleeping at the airport. I wanted to be hospitable to them for being so kind without even knowing me. My question is, should I bring them cookies? I already made the cookies to be honest (I like to bake), but now I'm having second thoughts. I can always give the cookies to friends before I leave if need be.

Being desperate for an answer, I tried googling this. Most people asked about bringing flowers. This is something I would never do. I bake pretty often, so I didn't think cookies would be a big deal, and flowers seem too extravagant. He also has 3 little sisters (under 12) so I thought they would really like cookies. Plus it's Thanksgiving, and you know- food is a big thing. But one of the comments on a thread I read said ""Don't act desperate"", and that scared me. I don't want to seem desperate, even though I really do want his parents to like me. They are pretty conservative. I don't want to seem too far one way or the other (not too standoffish but not too desperate). Thoughts?

TITLE: I [24/M] think I may have caused a grandmother's death for rejecting her granddaughter [20/F]

POST: Last Wednesday I hear that my grandma's friend's granddaughter is coming to my town to attend a nearby uni as an international student. I keep hearing things from my mom saying she's pretty, smart, etc. and that her side of the family takes an interest in me (in hopes of marriage). My dad is a very wealthy man in his native land and I attend a reputable school in the states so I guess they like me. 

On Wednesday night I meet her and she is drop dead gorgeous. The craziest part is that her looks aren't even the best thing about her. She has traveled quite a few places in her life so she's very well-cultured and open-minded. We will call her Barbara. 

Perfect, right? Cept I'm in a really great relationship right now and wouldn't trade it for the world. So I tell Barbara about my girlfriend as I am introducing her to a mutual friend that attends the same uni as her. I also mention how I will be visiting her next week. 

The next two days pass and I'm off to visit my girlfriend (we are doing long distance). On the morning of my departure I hear that Barbara's grandma fainted. Later that night I hear that she had passed away.  

I feel like a narcissist saying this but I can't help to feel that her grandma's death is my fault. I know for a fact that Barbara told her mom and grandma that I already have a gf and that id be visiting her this week. I can't help to think that I caused the grandma's fainting and death. 

Right now I feel terrible for being far apart from Barbara, who is all alone in a foreign land and starting school. But then again I owe my girlfriend a good amount of dates since I have not seeing her for a while. I plan to go back in a few days but am tempted to go back earlier.

What should I do? How should I feel? What do I tell her the next time I see her? I feel so lost and confused.

TITLE: How can we get on the same page about our future?

POST: I (27/f) am going to lose him (26/m) because we can't seem to get on the same page. We've been together for a year and a half and I think deep down we both want the same thing but we keep missing each other and I can't even explain it much less understand it fully. 

He wants someone he can build a life with and will be his intimate partner as well as his business partner. He wants to make future plans for the financial security of his family and he wants that all to start now. I want that too but he doesn't think I do. He is not convinced by the words that I say, but I truly mean them. 

He doesn't want to live with me right now or even spend a lot of time with me because he's soooo busy with work and educating himself on future security. Among other reasons he is a man who needs quite a bit of space. I can't commit to his picture of a long term future together if I don't even see myself in it in the short term. I don't feel that there is a real commitment now, how can I skip steps and plan a long term future? And I can't seem to get him to grasp that point. 

To him business and personal life are one in the same. I separate the two. I certainly cannot be his business partner if I cannot see myself as his life partner. We're currently separated because we don't see eye to eye and I am afraid of losing him. I might have already lost him. I have never felt so right, so good, and so whole about someone in my life. He is it. He is amazing. WE are amazing when it works and we have so much to give and learn from each other. There is a powerful connection there.

TITLE: My Crush [16F] is throwing me [16M] for a loop. Need Insight!

POST: 2 months ago she got out of a bad relationship with a guy who treated her like crap. She is funny, outgoing, and very energetic. Occasionally she is a bit flirty with some guys.

We talk every night over text, and we have a class together. We always tease each other, and joke, and laugh. Some of our discussions are really deep. She has told me a lot of stuff that she hasn't told too many other people.

She said at first that she was not looking for a relationship, but recently she said she is looking for a guy who can show her that he deserves her, because shes tired of being treated like crap.

Today, for example, she wanted me to share a chair with her while we worked on our project together. She would look at me and laugh, whisper into my ear, and get real close to me. She would rest her head on my shoulder. We were teasing eachother the whole time, but she seemed genuinely flirty.

But when our other group member took notice and asked if we were dating, she quickly and blandly said no, like it was nothing. This isn't the first time either.

She sometimes talks about enjoying the single life, but also asks me if she will ever fall in love, and about how guys are always interested in her. Some nights she will give me a full layout of info, others she seems aggravated and ends the conversation shortly.

A lot of times she tells me about how great I am, and that she would be dumb to lose such a great friend. But when relationships emerge in the conversation, she usually say something like ""I hope you find the right girl, youre such an amazing person"".

Its just so on and off, and I need a few pointers.

POST: My girlfriend is Malaysian and has been studying in the UK for the past 3 years. We have been in a relationship for 2 ½ years now.

Her visa to stay here is coming to an end later this year, then she will be forced to return to Malaysia despite opting to stay here if she had the choice. We have gone down the job route, to the point that she was offered the job here, but the employer failed to get a license to issue Visas on very petty grounds.

I (and others) have suggested getting married. It is something we've discussed before, and we are both happy to do it except that she refuses to get married before she goes back as she feels like she will just be doing it so she can get a visa, rather than because she will actually be married. She's happy for me to propose in 6 months, but not before she returns. The problem for me is that the delay will mean we are not going to be close to one another for at least a year, perhaps longer, other than for short visits (we both will be working full time).

Right now, I am positive and optimistic about our situation as I think that we can make it work, but two people living in entirely different cultures on opposite sides of the world might mean that we change a lot.

So this is a pretty short post, but basically I only have one more semester left in college. This has sparked lots of emotions and confusion of what we should do.

TITLE: Should subreddits with niche appeal be allowed to become default subreddits?

POST: For the uninitiated: Default subreddits are subreddits with a certain number of subscribers which makes them visible to people who aren't signed into reddit or haven't added or removed any subreddits.

I'm finding some of the default subreddits (i.e. atheism and politics) tend to be very off putting, it's not even about the principle of what is being argued or discussed but the way in which it is and the communities comments behind them.

Basically they're offputting and can scare away people who don't agree with these set of narrow principles these sorts of subreddits offer. So if you're religious you might be put off, if you're a Republican or conservative in general you might be put off, so on and so forth.

Subreddits which are more neutral and encourage intelligent discussion tend to be far more welcoming to all, subreddits such as videos or funny's are neutral anyway and would probably be a good 'hook' for new users.

I hesitate to recommend reddit to friends because they might see some of the incredibly narrow and arrogant opinions expressed in certain default subreddits and just associate that with me, which is not something I want.

TL;DR:","  Should subreddits with niche appeal be allowed to become default subreddits? If so, how should they be handled to make them more inviting to all reddit users?",  default subreddits should be picked based on the quality and neutrality of their content and not on the amount of circlejerking and subscribers.

His area has many job opportunities in my field, and we are both certain that this is a positive move for both of us.

My mother is convinced that I need to move back home to quickly pay down my student debt (which will be less than $10k). I see her point, and initially agreed - we had this conversation while my boyfriend and I were in an argument, which was a result of the distance, and has since been resolved. Currently, my mom thinks I am 100% moving back with her and my dad [53M].

I don't have a strained relationship with my mom, but our relationship certainly improved when I moved out to go to school. When I do visit my parents, I spend the most time with my brother [17M], who will be moving out to go to school in the fall. I don't think my dad has an opinion of where I go, so long as I am happy.

My mind is made up about where I want to go - I have given it a lot of thought and after weighing my options, my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together. I'm afraid that when I tell my mom what I've decided, she will be hurt and object. I've never had to approach such a topic with her before, and am unsure how to proceed.

TITLE: My [20f] roommate [20f] chews with her mouth open

POST: This ones pretty self explanatory. Best friend/roommate and I have been living together for 2 years. Her chewing has always annoyed me but I've never said anything, but recently a few friends commented behind her back that her chewing was annoying. She has talked before about being a mouth breather, meaning that it's easier for her to breathe through her mouth than her nose, which is probably why she chews with her mouth open. 

I've held off for so long, but I felt kinda bad for her when some friends said her chewing annoyed them. I started to wonder if it might be easier for her to hear it from me than, say, some guy who's dumping her after a few dates or something because her chewing is a turn off. (I know, that's a more extremes situation that's not likely to happen but you know what I mean.) she's a pretty sensitive girl and I don't want her to feel bad. so... Should I say anything? Should I just ignore it like I've been doing? Thanks guys.

TL;DR:","  Roommate chews with her mouth open, friends say her chewing is annoying. Should I say anything or just ignore it like I've been doing?",  roommate chews really loudly to the point of multiple people noticing. Should I say something as her best friend or keep quiet to save any hurt feelings?

I am not into wild parties every night, but one every weekend (or at least every couple of weekends) is a priority for me. These are my problems:

* Tech school students are not that much into partying
* I am international so I basically have no idea how to be cool with Americans
* (because of these two) I don't know how to find the wright people to hang out with (geeks --- wright people --- wild animals)
* I heard that some weirdos rat people for no good reason, like drinking a beer in the room or coming back from a party drunk, and this may seem like no big deal to citizens, but I am on visa and they will find any reason to kick me out, so how do I stay away from those guys
* (Q) are there places where each type of students usually hang out?

Could you give me advice on how to deal with these problems and stay away from the dark side at the same time? Thanks!

POST: A few hours ago I nocked over a can of paint while me, my brothers, my mom and my step dad were moving things around upstairs so we could paint the roof and walls. It splattered all over their racks of clothes and the floor. We filled up the bath tubs with water and put their cloths in them and put soaked towels on the floor.

TITLE: TIFU when I danced with a girl and tried to make a joke

POST: This happened within the past 36 hours, so it's more of a T½IFU

In my hometown there is a Swiss hall that has annual events.  During the day there is Swiss style wrestling (which I compete in) and at night a dance with plenty of food and drink all day.  At the dance I was trying to build up some manliness to ask a cute girl to dance, and lo and behold, she sees me standing awkwardly a few yards off and beats me to the punch.  I have known this girls family vaguely for many years even though I see them several times a year at the hall.   So we're dancing and having a good time, and she is much better than me.  The music mainly consists of slower dances.  I keep stumbling around (I'm not even drunk) and try to crack a few jokes.  I say that I should cut of my toes so that I stop stepping on hers.  She gives me a strange look and a half laugh and we keep on dancing.  Later that evening I am talking with my best friend who is that girl's cousin.  He hears that I was dancing with her and asks if I knew she had a prosthetic leg. I most certainly did not know this.  Later I would find out that everyone but me was aware of this.   I now understand her uncomfortable reaction to my 'joke' and why she asked her sister if she wanted to switch dance partners.

Here's the thing, I know she is busy and probably tired but can someone be so busy as to not spend a second seeing how their significant other is doing? We met online and she lives in Mexico while I live in the U.S., so I understand a that it is harder to communicate. We used to message everyday and now I'm lucky if she messages me back and if she does, she stops after a short while. I do text her to see how she is doing but I feel like I'm annoying and needy and wait for her to go first. I realize this all sounds a little selfish of me but it is clawing at my mind and I am literally crying myself to sleep over this. Does she hate me? Did she find someone else? Am I as boring as I think I am? I don't want to ask her because I'm afraid I'll make her feel bad and make me look like a crazy needy freak.

TITLE: I [24/F] feel so lonely despite my relationship with [20/M] 1 yr together

POST: Sorry I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I'm feeling so horrid right now. 

I have been with my current partner for 1 year now, and I have given up alot to be with him (moved to another country, even). When we first got together we had the most beautiful relationship of my life, I had never been that content with anyone. 

Fastforward to now - he's asleep, clueless of any problem and I'm lying here wanting to cry...same as every night for the last week. 
We barely talk any more, he comes home from work in the evening, plays his phone for a few hours (despite my requests to spend some time together/watch a movie/anything) and then he goes to sleep. When we do talk, I feel like it is meaningless small talk (""oh its hot today!""), and not lighthearted conversation like we used to have/like couples should have. 

...he won't even be intimate with me, and pushes me off when I hug him, saying I'm being clingy and annoying (I probably am by this point, I'm desperate for answers). I have explained how I feel to him, and he tries to assure me he still loves me. I ask him why we have changed and he denies that anything has changed, or says he will try harder but then the next day its back to the same old...

Sorry to sound like a neurotic headcase, but everything is different, and I don't know why. I feel like he doesn't love me anymore, and I'm beyond depressed about it. And in turn, worrying that by having this depressed and unhappy attitude will push him away even further because I'm not my old happy self. Its a vicious cycle - I can't pretend to be happy because I feel wretched, and being unhappy around him is sure to make it worse. 

NOTE: He doesn't have time/opportunity to meet any other girls so I'm not worried he's cheating, since he comes straight home from work every day/his only mobile is our shared one.

TL;DR:","  Been with my boyfriend for 1 year, everything is different now, he doesn't love me anymore and it's putting a strain on our relationship. Feeling very lonely and depressed.

POST: This happened a couple of hours ago, and i'm still a bit nervous about all this. I'm what most would consider a hardcore gamer, and as most people into this, they usually cherish and collect their favorite games and such.

Today I skipped work because i woke up feeling like something had banged on my left side, hurting all over (ear infection, it's a reoccurring thing, I need to get this checked more often than not.) and decided to stay home and rest a bit more.

I stayed home all day and at about 6 my dad rolls around to pick me up to go to the ER to see what's going on with my ear. During the following hour and a half I spent on the ER to get this checked and pick up the prescription the doctor gave me, I get home and find some clothing on my porch, lying on the path to my entrance. My dog was feasting on some plastic bag and at first I thought it was just some kids who'd have thrown a bag of old clothing onto my yard.

As soon as I get up to my room though, things took a dire turn for me. I froze, looking baffled at what was right in front of me. My monitor was all crooked and the cables were off, and I look to the left and see this gaping hole where all my consoles were. Then it finally sunk into me: Someone robbed my house.

TITLE: My SO(24M) didn't get into the school of his choice and I(21F) don't really know how to be there for him because I'm happy.

POST: Okay, to start off, I know my title is making me sound like an uber bitch. Please let me explain. 

My boyfriend, lets call him Bubba, have been together for almost four years. We've been friends for almost seven. For the past two years I have been living with him and his Mother. My Mom and I had a very bad relationship, so his Mom graciously invited me into her home. For the most past, we really love each other. We do fight, but I can honestly see myself settling with him. He's the most generous man I've ever encontured. 

Back to the question, Bubba applied to a very prestigious school. I can't afford to leave the city yet, so I was just going to move downtown and go to school there. This would mean we would be close to three hours apart. I know a lot of people can make long distance relationships work, but I knew I couldn't. It's been making me miserable thinking about not being with him whenever I want. Plus, we have two cats and he would be taking them. I didn't want to split them up because they love each other. 

Today he found out that he didn't get in. Of course, he is crushed. He's now doubting his intelligence and the fact that he went back to school. He took off a few years and when we started dating I motivated him to go back. Since he has been back, he has been excelling in every class. Everyone thought he would get in without a problem. To make it worse his sister got in and his parents, unintentionally, tend to compare them to one another. I want to be there for him, but I'm happy. I feel like a sick bastard saying that, but I am happy. I didn't want him to leave. I figured he'd go off and find someone much better than me. I'm being very selfish, I know...
How do I sincerely be there for him without coming off fake?

TL;DR:",  My boyfriend didn't get into the school of his choice and I don't know how to be there for him because I'm happy. How do I be there for him without coming off fake?,  My boyfriend didn't get into the university of his choice. How can I emotionally be there for him when I'm happy.

My stomach started to hurt a little but I said what the fuck and went for the nice greasy pizza when it came out.
So about five minutes after I finish my pizza I get the brilliant idea to go down on my fiance. She gets in front of me and pulls down her pants and I start to please her. I stop for a second because I think I have to burp. NOPE. It wasn't a burp it was vomit. I threw up the pizza and energy drink I just had into her pants and it ran down her legs. She just stood there and took it. The pain and embarrassment crippled me to the floor and I just laid there and wept for a few minutes while she cleaned herself up.

TITLE: I have an urge to kill one of my cats.

POST: We have 2 cats. One is a fantastic indoor cat. The other one is lives outside. This cat was a gift from a friend who got it from a shelter. It was injured and overall nasty. No big deal, we took it to the vet and nursed it back to health. This is where the weird stuff starts.

The cat did nothing but sit behind the toilet and shit on the floor. We tried to teach it to use a litter box but it would just go back to pooping and peeing on the floor. Then it got violent. It started hissing and jumping at the kids when they would go into the bathroom. The climax was when it attacked a child while she was just playing video games and ignoring the cat. The cat ran to her and started scratching and hissing at her. I threw it outside.

This cat now just sits on the deck looking in the window and meows until we feed it. After feeding it leaves for a few minutes and starts the meowing again. More compassionate people than I have let the cat inside but it immediately stands at the door and meows to go back outside. 

I feel an irrational amount of resentment for this cat to the point of wanting to put it down. It has seemingly no redeemable qualities and has caused much damage to our house as well as attacking the children. If I were alone I would have done it already. I still may.

TITLE: Rising senior. Can anyone recommend me a major/career based on my description (warning long)?

POST: I'm torn as I have many interests but none of them seem to lead to a good career. If I am capable of being an engineering major but I don't particularly like the sciences but I prefer the arts, should I pursue it anyway to have a well paying job? Same goes for being a pre-med student although the whole process seems way too long.  

But that's the thing, as much as I love art, I have zero talent for creating it, just appreciating and consuming it, especially film.

From Lars von Trier to Paul Thomas Anderson, Kim Ki Duk, and Dardenne brothers to name a few, I love studying film. My other interests are equally lacking in job prospects such as philosophy, religious studies, women's studies, and literature. 

I have average GPA so I can't into top top schools, so I'm already set on my state flagship. I've already taken all the standardized tests. The only thing left is choosing a major or a department to apply for.  

Here are some of my numbers that reflect my academic abilities.

3.5 unweighted (but 3.2 during my last year due to laziness). 

4.3 weighted (pretty much every class has been IB or ""pre-IB"" w/e that means) 

2300 SAT. 780 Math + 740 Reading + 780 Writing

800 SAT II Math II, 720 Biology. 

AP Exam: 5's and 4's on BC Calc, European History, English Literature, English Language, Chemistry, Spanish Language. (Govt + American History from first 2 years) 

I've found ^ none of the classes to be interesting. Only class I enjoyed was a philosophy elective when I became obsessed with existentialism, Sartre and Camus (but this seems to be a typical first year kinda thing).  

personality wise, I'm very good with people and socializing, although I prefer to avoid public speaking.

TL;DR:","  I'm a rising senior who has no talent for creating anything, but loves studying film. Can anyone recommend me a major/career based on my description (warning long)?",  decently smart (hopefully? but everyone likes to think of themselves as intelligent so take this as a grain of salt)

TITLE: My [26 M] GF [22 F] says she loves me, doesn't mind if I don't love her back

POST: I have been dating this girl for about 7-8 months.  We have had some conversations about how neither of us is looking for anything too ""serious.""  I just got out of a very long term relationship about 6 months before I met her, and have had difficulty with relationships since then (ex was mentally abusive and relationship was terrible).  

I try to be a good BF, take her out, make her feel special, and am generally a nice guy.  She means a lot to me, is one of the sweetest people I have ever met and is a really genuine, caring person.  

Long story short, she recently told me she loves me. I was sort of dreading this moment, responded sort of awkwardly of course with a ""thanks"" (not joking, I said thanks). Its not that I don't care about her, I just don't feel that emotion towards her and don't really expect to. I am not a very emotional guy, and have only told one person before that I love them.  

To my surprise, she just said ""I know"" when I told her this.  She wasn't expecting me to say it back.  She said she doesn't mind at all that she loves me and I don't love her, because she knows how I am.  Not gonna lie, this blew my mind.  Now I'm struggling with the feeling that I am somehow wronging her, or taking advantage of her, because she is more invested than me in this relationship.

I feel like I'm a decent catch. I have two college degrees, a great job in my field, workout 5-6 times per week (and have ~9% body fat and a bit of muscle definition), pay my bills on time, and have a few thousand dollars saved up to buy my first house. I also smoke pot almost every night. 

I'm responsible about it. I don't smoke and drive, I take care of my business for the day before I smoke, and I try to minimize tar inhalation as much as possible. Also, I now rarely drink because I simply prefer to smoke.

I'm about a year out of my last relationship and feeling really good about myself. I've gone on a couple dates from OKC, but have yet to find a good match.

I know pot is a deal breaker for at least some women and am wondering whether I should quit in order to increase the number of potential matches. I also feel like there are other reasons to quit like health, job opportunities, etc. But the main one for me right now is to eliminate it as a deal breaker for potential relationships. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be considering quitting right now.

Should I change my lifestyle? I don't necessarily see smoking as ""wrong"". But I don't love being a pothead either. What do you all think?

TITLE: Just want to be loved by my wife again. Insights welcomed!

POST: Me (M29) and my wife (F29) have been married for just one year, and had dated for four prior. Over this past year, we were lacking in the intimacy department. This was my fault, I foolishly thought that our emotional connection was enough and didn't need sex as much. I was quite wrong and now understand that. 

Anyway, this led my wife to feel rejected by me and she fell out of love. After this came to my knowledge, I have changed the way I look at our relationship, and have readjusted my priorities in it. I want nothing more than for us to work things out. 

Recently she had an affair with her boss (who is 50 years old and also engaged), and says she has real feelings for him. This sounds bad I know. But I understand how it got to this point.  She is trying to give us a chance, and things are getting better (sleeping in the same bed again, I get a kiss goodbye in the morning, spend time together after we get home from work etc), but she still has feelings for him, and seemingly slightly less feelings for me.  We had a fight about it, I yelled (which I have never done in an argument during my adult life), but I told her that I forgive her even though it hurts. 

She says she cares a great deal about me, but is having a hard time loving me again after being rejected so many times.  

We're starting marriage counseling next week, and she seems optimistic about it.  I guess I wanted to get other women's thoughts on my situation. What do I need to communicate to her, is there anything I can do to salvage our marriage.
