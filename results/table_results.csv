TITLE: Me [22M] not in a relationship, but dating a [22F] found out she had a relationship with someone and i'm not to fond of it. Can someone help me out and fix my insecurity issue?

POST: We are both black, and I found out the girl I have been dating used to date exclusively only white men.  Like exclusively until she met me.  Her only partners have been white men.  I mean, I am not cool with this.  I am not into the interracial dating scene and this is really an issue with my psyche.  I know this is racist.  I get it, but this is really bothering me.

TITLE: Is the extra attention you're getting actually slowing down your progress?

POST: Hi all! I'm 25/m 5'8"", been dieting and exercising for about 12 weeks now. Dropped about 20 pounds, starting at 240 and currently standing at 218 this morning. When I started, I stayed away from a lot of social gatherings and just focused on my program. Well honestly I was just a bit self-conscious about how much I gained. I also have a skin condition on my face that causes rashes to break out a lot. Anyway, I skipped out on a lot of birthdays, graduations, etc. Around week 8 I felt confident enough to start going out again, the diet has pretty much eased the rashes on my face and I'm more clear than I have been in awhile. My friends noticed my weight loss immediately. These days I'm starting to attend more gatherings and kind of regretting it, haha. I find it hard to stay away from all the drinks and snacks that come along with it. From starting at a pace of 2-5 pounds lost every week, I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 weeks. Thankfully I haven't gained.

TITLE: Buy a New Home, or Pay off the Old?

POST: My wife and I have been saving and clearing debt for the last 2 years in order to start home shopping this September.  Currently we're unable to sell our existing condo as it's worth about $80k (we owe about $99k).  The difference is about the same as our new home deposit.

After some number crunching - we realized since clearing all other debt - if we were very frugal, we could pay off the condo entirely in a little over 10 months. (Combine income of about $140k pre-tax)

While we don't want to wait another year - having an additional 100k in buy power + possibly the ability to use the condo as a cheap equity line for new home needs sounds appealing.

POST: Hello r/legaladvice, I'm moving to a new town for college in Florida and signed a lease yesterday for a room within a 4/4 Apartment in a larger apartment complex for students, through a private company/corporation.

I was given the last available room within that floorplan but was refused disclosure of who my room mates are until after signing (dumb idea, I know). I was assured they were ""random people"" which is in fact not the case, it's a group of 3 people who know each other and come from a different culture, I already contacted them and it was made clear to me that they'd rather not have me there.  There are several other problems with the apartment/room that are now starting to show also, such as a lack of power outlets in the walk in closet (I was told I could put a fridge in there) and a few other things.

I haven't taken possession of any keys yet and my lease doesn't officially start until August, all I really did was sign off on the lease, a few addenda and a guarantor form. What's my legal standing in this instance and is there a way I can break my lease? If need be I can pay some fines but there's no way I could pay off the whole lease or something to that extent. 

Any help appreciated!

POST: A girl that I've known for a few years and I began hooking up recently. I'm extremely attracted to her; we have tons in common and just generally get on great and have become very close. However, the kissing is just..awkward. 

We both have different styles and both want to seem to lead. We acknowledged it and tried to work on it. I kissed her my way and she tried to follow suit but we just weren't synching up and couldn't get into a rhythm. She got paranoid then and wouldn't kiss me the way she usually goes about it.

She's pretty much conceded that it's a deal breaker and that we just don't have sexual chemistry. I'm not so sure. Yes, it was awkward but I wanted to work on it and hopefully we'd eventually get there, and I was still turned on during it.

TITLE: Venting. My dad [54/m] is being a jerk about my engagement [23/f] and it's really awful

POST: I just got engaged to my awesome boyfriend [24/m] of 2 years. We met in my last semester of college and are so incredibly excited to be taking this step together. My mom is thrilled, his parents are awesome and super supportive, and our friends and family have been nothing but kind.

Then there's my dad. He's always been the type of father who's incredibly loving and supportive as long as I am doing things he approves of or need him in someway (which, growing up, was basically all the time. I was a quiet kid.) He is great with my boyfriend to his face, but when it's just me and him alone he won't call him by his name, asks me why I hang out with him so much, and says that I'm sacrificing my career for my fiancé and that I'm going to just become another baby-making heifer (his words). I've asked him to stop several times. I don't even know where this is coming from - I graduated from college two years ago and will start grad school this fall. 

Tonight he did something that just tore me apart. My fiancé is foreign (currently back home for the month) and I skyped him and his folks from my parents' house. My parents have never met or spoken to my fiancé's parents. When I told my mom to come say hello, she went to get my father and he just LEFT THE HOUSE. Didn't say a word. It was awkward to cover for him. Then, when he came back, I was talking to a girlfriend on the phone and overheard my mom asking him to apologize. He said she couldn't make him do anything and he LEFT AGAIN. He called my mom an hour ago to say he was staying at his mothers for the night (not unusual, he's her caretaker, but still). 

I don't know what to do or say or even what kind of advice I'm expecting. I'm just hurt and angry. I don't know. This really sucks. I'm fed up with his crap.

POST: Throwaway cause she knows my account. 
I'll start by saying I am a very introverted person that is constantly surrounded by people. I work in HR and have 3 roommates and rarely get a moment to breath. So I recently got a chance to take a lengthy vacation, and I want to use it to take a cross-country road trip I've wanted for a long time. My plan is for it to take around 3 months, I'll be stopping at several national parks, big cities, and visiting my brother. 
The issue here is that I told my best friend about it and she has assumed that I want her to come as well, since she's recently graduated and this would be a good time for her. While I love my best friend, this is defeating the purpose of the trip. Best friend is extremely extroverted, does not understand the concept of wanting to do something alone. She's also rather princessy, and would likely complain about a lot of the hikes/nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, and enjoy some peace and quiet for once in my life. I know that 3-months in each other's faces would probably cause a fight, and that's the last thing I want to deal with on this trip. Is there a way I can tell her this is something I want to do alone, or should I just bring her and hope for the best? Would I regret going alone and halfway through, wish I had some company?

This is important because the wanting to really meet at least once and get down to business was great.

TITLE: Why don't self posts get karma?

POST: I understand that they used to and that people [complained] because there were lots of ""vote up if"" type posts that were getting karma. Removing karma from them, however, does not appear to have changed things. They've always been reported and deleted (none are on in the pages [archived by archive.org] for the time before it was removed). They still show up from time to time (despite it actually saying right above where I'm typing this ""*Beginning your title with ""vote up if"" is violation of intergalactic law.*""), then they get reported and removed.

However, one effect that this has influenced is the creation of rage comics and an increase in screenshots. I've even noticed that increase just over the last year. Now, I'm not saying that they wouldn't happen if self posts got karma, nor that they are always inappropriate, but it is evident that there are some things that would be better as self posts that are instead posted as screen shots or rage comics and it's hard to not think that the lack of karma for self posts plays a part in this.

So, I think we should revisit this decision. It seems to me that self posts add original content to reddit and should be encouraged. This very, and very popular, subreddit is a perfect example. It accepts nothing *but* self posts. [IAmA] is another perfect example of a popular subreddit that is affected by this that is also quite popular. So, is there any reason we shouldn't start letting self posts get karma? If there is not, what kind of karma would be the most appropriate for them?

POST: Hey Reddit,

Long time lurker here. Need some advice on how to approach my situation.

Basically, last week, my boyfriend (27M) of one year broke up with me because he doesn't feel satisfied about where he is in life and he wants to focus on school/work/life/whatever in order to make a positive change. In light of all this, he felt like he couldn't give me the attention that I wanted/deserved in a relationship. But I suggested having a serious talk about how I could support him through this transition. He was saying things like ""pushing me to hang out every weekend isn't really supporting me"" and ""I need to focus on myself."" Fair enough. I couldn't really say anything to change his mind after that and we broke up. For good. Or so I thought.

Recently, he's been texting me and saying that he loves and misses me. He said that he wants to meet up and try to work something out because, in his words, ""I miss having you in my life"" and ""I realized that you mean a lot to me and what we have is hard to find and build.""

As much as I would love to immediately take him back, I'm worried that he would just break up with me again for the same reasons. It seems like he freaks out when things in his life start to get stressful. I feel like the reason we broke up in the first place was because our relationship was becoming a source of stress for him (I recently had to move a couple of hours away from him, which certainly made things harder for us). 

He wants to meet up this weekend to talk about getting back together. He's going to see a therapist soon, so that might offer some perspective too. 

I realize that staying broken up is a viable option. But I also want to give him a fair chance to explain himself this weekend. What kind of questions should I be asking him? How will I know that he truly wants to take the necessary steps to make our relationship work? What should I be doing?

It's been fun and romantic but I'm definitely a monogamous person at heart, so I've been just seeing her. I wouldn't expect the same, but I guess once we sleep together I'd hope for the same. Anyway, we were supposed to hang out last night and she texted me in the afternoon saying she slept with someone else and felt bad. I was upset (mostly just took a hit to my self esteem) but was really calm in my responses to her. I said I wasn't quite sure why she told me about it and she said it was because she was covered in bruises which made my stomach sink. She's definitely into rough sex and it just made me think, you're not telling me because you wanted to be honest with me as much as you wanted me to know you had good sex? Of course I didn't say that. It just kind of sucks to hear this. So I asked what she wanted with me and she said she wants to progress into a relationship eventually. But I feel like things just got incredibly weird between us. Am I overreacting by feeling upset by something when we never defined the relationship? Or is it sort of inappropriate for her to be telling me this? I can't really figure out where to go from here and I haven't responded to her since she said what she wanted.

TITLE: (37M) Suddenly having real trouble finding love... But it's not what you think.

POST: Hi, RA folks,

I spent my twenties in a series of long-term relationships. When the last ended painfully, I had a ton of healing to do. She had been my great love and seemed so out of my league, I'd never be able to truly replace her. I felt a huge amount of painful pressure to settle down and prove my worth to the world, and it felt like I'd lost my big chance (BS, I know).

I spent my early 30s trying to date seriously, but mostly just having shortish relationships, freaking out in some way (clearly unhealed from my big breakup), and respectfully ending things. The last one of those ended about two years ago. I then took some single time to get therapy and work on that reticence to bond with people, and it's worked. I ended up moving to a new city for a fresh start. Since then, I have had a couple of very short flings, but nothing serious.

Most of my loves have been friends first. I've tried internet dating but never had a good coupling come from that. Back in the day, I always seemed to be meeting someone and having magic occur. Now, it doesn't.

A lot of people would say ""Your 30s are different; you're not as social, you've got all these extra responsibilities, your friends group is smaller..."" but given my lifestyle (as a creative professional in a big city with a big group of similar friends), none of those statements ring true. What's more, in my 20s, I was damaged goods—dealing with a litany of undiagnosed and untreated mental issues, often out of shape, unmotivated, and overdoing the partying. 

These days, I'm a changed man... I'm much happier, I'm fit, healthy, and decently attractive (in my own strange nerdy way).

TITLE: [M/29] Does the traditional no sex/no cohabitation/no foreplay rules [F/28] till marriage actually lead to a stronger marriage?

POST: My girlfriend 28 has grown up with a very strong set of beliefs that there should be no sex/foreplay/cohabitation till marriage, subsequently she has never had a solid relationship, has never had sex or fallen in love. To put things in perspective, she had recently achieved (her first) orgasm one night I had helped her though her cloths.

So here we are dating... going out to dinner a few times a week, making out on the couch like teenagers. If I press her too far sexually, she then regresses back and that is not done for a few weeks. Meanwhile I am thinking, that I will never be close enough to marry her if we are not progressing the relationship (foreplay, spending the night, maybe even moving in with each other at some point).

------------------------------------------------------

When I asked her values she states the following. :

""I dont want to be test ridden like a car"".

""If I am going to act like the wife, why not become the wife"".

""Its harder to just walk away when you are married"".

""I would feel less of my self if I was living with someone who did not marry me"".

""Marriage is great for taxes"".

""I need to be engaged before we do anything more than we are currently doing"".

""I know you want to buy a house, but I wont move in unless we are married (once we are married I want us to buy a joint house together so were both on the title and the partner could never say ""this is MY house"".

""We could sign a prenump if you want"".

--------------------------------------------------------

Like this is some formula for a relationship, minus the love that would somehow fall into a good relationship.

I dont see any of this shit above.. I want basic love, love that would flourish into a normal sexual life, and progress into a strong relationship, then marriage.

I currently feel none of this and here is she talking about heavy, outdated formal dating. Dont get me wrong I like this girl, but every time she talks about this I drift further apart.

TL;DR:"," My gf has very traditional views on sex/foreplay/cohabitation till marriage, has never had a solid relationship, has never had sex or fallen in love. I want a strong relationship before marriage, does this formula work?"," Current (relationship novice) girlfriend is making me jump through all the traditional dating to marriage hoops like its some sort of magic formula for a successful marriage, I am not feeling any of this and see it as a receipt for disaster.",6.125,1.51953125,92,-0.1409912109375,128,wins

TITLE: Why do people make such a huge deal out of going through someone's e-mail? Who really cares?

POST: The people who get caught up, that's who. If you're not getting caught doing something you're not supposed to, what's to be mad at?

Why do people decide to give each other their passwords for things like that to begin with? Because the people in question are trying to prove to one another that they can be trusted, and that they trust the other person.

""I've got nothing to hide from you, go ahead and check,"" is pretty standard nowadays it seems. The only people who seem to be getting mad about it are the people who are too DUMB to use that same e-mail account to do something deceitful!

It's not an invasion of privacy if you GAVE SOMEONE YOUR PASSWORD, strictly for the purpose of them entering it on-line, to log in to your e-mail account. Unless you made specific stipulations that they would only access your e-mail ""IF/WHEN...."" then you've got nothing to complain about. And, IF anyone feels like their SO is trying to impose such restrictions in the relationship.. it's not a good relationship.

If somebody reads your shit and you get caught up, OH WELL, should've covered your tracks better. So, before you begin whining about how so and so is to blame for this and that, remember that you were the one who did the bad thing, and while now you have all this anger because you feel your life is fucked, it's nobody's fault but your own.

TL;DR:"," If you're caught doing something you're not supposed to, and you give out your password to log into your e-mail account, why do people get so worked up about it? And, if you feel your SO is trying to restrict your relationship, why not just cut them out of your life entirely?"," If you don't want someone to read your e-mail, don't give them your password.

TITLE: TIFU by competing in a poetry slam on drugs.

POST: Years ago and all that. 

I was at a music festival I've been going to for years, and competing in their poetry slam which I had done a number of times and had started to get recognized. 

Now, I had just got a wisdom tooth removed and I was on painkillers. 

For those of you who have never seen a poetry slam, it's multiple poets performing pieces and there are a number of judges that give you a score, top ten or so go to the next round, two or three rounds, and you can win things. These events are hosted by someone from the local poetry scene and they MC the event. 

First round, I nailed it. Did a very long piece called Meladies that I'm rather proud of. It was a long double entendre about picking up girls and writing music. It's tasteful but boy is it suggestive. I was 3rd place out of maybe 20 in the first round. 

Second round, I go immediately after a girl who did an amazing and moving piece about equality and fair treatment. 

It should be noted here that the co host of this particular slam was a rather attractive poet that I most definitely had a thing for at the time. She even seemed a little wooed by my first piece! Score! 

So it's my turn, and me, trying to get some cool points with aforementioned co host, say ""Man let's give it up to these hosts, they're killing it."" 

Dead silence. Awkward. 

I do my second piece, nothing in particular, just some rhythm and rhyme. Decent scores, snaps during it and all that. 

Then the co host girl gets up and says ""Uh did you say hoes or hosts?"" 

Apparently I slur my words when I'm on drugs. I already looked like a man slut after lines like ""I can cop two in a pinch, at the same time like, wanna split a seven inch?"" and ""So I started rhyming, bumping that back seat rhythm, cus I have a way with words, then I have my way with them."" Then I call a girl a hoe after she does a passionate piece about equal rights.

TL;DR:"," competed in poetry slam on painkillers and had a thing for co host, said drugs affected my performance, said co host slurred my words, called girl a hoe."," Called a girl who just did a very passionate poem about equality a hoe because I was on painkillers, thus ruining my chances at winning the slam and my chances at getting some action.

TITLE: I've been asked to take part in a TV show about drugs, on drugs, would you do it?

POST: A well known TV channel has approached me and asked me to be on a special debate show about drugs. They say that it's looking into the therapeutic value of a certain drugs and there will be lots of experts on the show who support legalisation of said drug. 

The producers claim to want to get the opinions from ""The Street"" and say that we'll be given enough time (in an interview with a news-man) to put our own views on the subject across. Everyone in my country takes or has taken this drug and the fact it's illegal when the real social damager alcohol is still available seems pig headed by our government. 

I currently run my own business, so answer to no boss. However, although I initially agreed to be in the show I'm now starting to think that I might be misrepresented or that I might regret the whole thing in later life.

On the plus side, I'd like to be the person who says ""The Emperor's wearing no clothes!"" and stand up and make a statement for the people of my society, who I know think pretty much the same as I do. 

So would you do it?

TITLE: Something to keep my mom busy?

POST: Long Backstory:

My mom's best friend died about six months ago, our 12 year old Sheltie. About a month ago, she decided she was ready to get a new dog, so we adopted a beagle/pug mix puppy. Between getting up at 5a.m. to go to school, studying/doing homework, working out, and having a social life, I didn't have much time to help take care of it. My mother and second eldest sister are both disabled, so they can't work, and were suppose to take care of the dog that *they* wanted. Between them two, and my eldest sister, who is a home-health-aid for my mom and lives with us, she apparently was too much to handle, and I was harrased by them to help more, even though I didn't have too much time. They also didn't consider the fact that I'm alergic to dogs, and could hardly touch her. Anyway, the dog was always biting my hands, but no one cared... until she bit my eldest sister. They just returned her because of this, and my mom is upset... because, even how much she complained about it, she loved the dog. My eldest sister's cat absolutely loves my mom, and is always cuddling with her and not my sister, which also causes problems, but that is apparently not good enough. She is now mad at *me* for not helping out, even though I'm alergic to dogs and break out whenever one scratches/bites me, something the dog was notorious/returned for. I know I went on a tangent there, but I'm trying to ask, what are some things that will keep my mom busy?

TITLE: My [22M] girlfriend [22F] says she wasn't initially physically attracted to me. What should I do?

POST: Just like it says on the tin. My SO of 2.5 years recently admitted to me that she didn't initially find me attractive, although she claims that changed after she got to know me.

I certainly understand that a person's overall attractiveness is a function of their personality, and one's level of attraction to a person can change over time, I'm very upset that she never felt any *physical* attraction for me. 

It's great that she's ""attracted"" by my personality and all, but I can't help but feel that this isn't good enough. I thought she was physically attractive right away. I feel pretty terrible about myself that she didn't feel the same way. I don't want to go on in a relationship where I feel that I'm not good enough for her.

I still love her very much, and I know she loves me. I'm pretty crushed at finding this out, and I don't know what to do about it. It seems to me that she was immature to think she could have a satisfying relationship with someone she didn't click with physically. I want her to be happy, so I can't help but wonder if we need to break it off so she can find someone who actually works for her physically.

Is this an overreaction? I think I'm emotionally compromised because I'm so upset about this. So I'm hoping for advice from a few smart people here.

What should I do? Is there a way of understanding what she's told me that doesn't make it sound so bad? What am I missing?

POST: Last post: 

So I heard what you guys said... Again. I talked to her about it but she was pretty set about doing it over 1-2 months. I argued with her a bit saying that it will create drama since she'd be replying to him less and less over a course of time. This did happen before as she ignored him because she wanted to indirectly say that she didn't like him. Anyways, I told her I could tolerate her doing it over a course of time but just last night, she told me that she cut him off. 

Now, she's pretty sad. Her main reason for being sad is because she had lots of memories with him and now, she doesn't have anyone other than me to talk to everyday. She says she feels lonely and I don't know what to do. (Her dad is very controlling and rarely lets her go out to see her friends) 

I feel extremely bad about telling her to cut him off.

TITLE: Advice on upcoming Half Marathon: to run, or not to run?

POST: I should really say run/walk, I am no where near advanced enough to simply ""run"".

I'll try to stick to the ""need to knows"" and keep this short-ish...

I trained last fall for a half marathon, I ended up not run/walking in the official marathon(financial issues) so instead went to a park where I normally do my thing, I ran/walked the 13.1 miles on my own(my time was 3:11:17). That was in October. November I barely ran (maybe 10 days total, including a 10k, but most of the other runs were 1.5-3 miles). I did not run at all in December or January, and I started running 2-4 days a week mid way through February and have been consistent with that up until last week when I dropped the ball(kind of messy break up).
So I haven't ran any more that 3 miles since November, and am feeling really unprepared for this half marathon I am signed up for on March 11th. I have a friend who is amazingly supportive and wants me to go for it, but I just feel I am going to make a fool of myself(we have a 4 hour time limit) or worse, end up hurting myself. 
I know only I know my own body in the end, but with the information at hand, any advice, opinions would be greatly appreciated. I am teetering in the middle so I thought some advice from strangers that know something about running might be able to help.

TITLE: Should I [21/F] ask the guy [24/M] I'm seeing to take down his ""single"" status on Facebook?

POST: I've been seeing a guy pretty consistently (about once a week) for around three months now. I'm pretty inexperienced in terms of relationships, and I brought up exclusivity way too early (at around the 4th date), because we started doing physical things, and I wasn't that comfortable doing them without exclusivity. When I asked then if he was looking for exclusive things, he sheepishly said, ""I don't know."" But then he said he really respected that I didn't want to do physical things without exclusiveness--that it was rare for this time and place... (um, ok.)     

     

Anyway, it seems like he's been leaning more toward exclusiveness in the last two months. When I found his okc profile, which he hasn't signed on to since Jan, he said, ""maybe I should take that down."" I think I shrugged in response, and said a half-hearted, ""yeah."" He also said, ""I'm not seeing anyone else, if that's what your'e afraid of.""      

Recently, I texted him, ""do you want to see other people?"" and he said, ""not necessarily. I mean, I'm not approaching people in grocery stores anymore."" (That was how we met...)      

I was like, ""ok,"" or something like that. I honestly don't even know if I want to be exclusive with him, it's just that things have gone further physically than I'm comfortable with without exclusivity. (I lost my v-card to him...) It's not that it means that much to me or whatever, I just feel like because it's the first time I've done it, I'd like some exclusivity.      
  
Sorry for the ramble! Anyway, I just wanted some opinions on whether it's reasonable to ask him to take down his ""single"" status on Facebook. Not to put ""in a relationship,"" but to just leave it blank.

TITLE: At what point is lack of sex a reasonable cause to end a relationship? (25M, 27F)

POST: I'm 25 and male, my girlfriend is 27. We have dated for over a year and a half and we don't have our own places so it's relatively rare to get a chance to fool around, maybe once or twice a month. She's a virgin (though had two previous boyfriends in which she had manual and oral sex), and the handful of times we tried to have vaginal sex she would ask me to try repeatedly but immediately cringe and push me away because of the pain. She insists she doesn't have any kind of medical problem, and always eventually says we will try again next time.

This is my first proper relationship and I don't want to just throw it away since I have no idea how long until I'm in another. I also don't know how common this kind of problem is but by now this aspect of the relationship makes me angry. I don't see how I could  explain that she needs to start having sex and enjoying it, or break up. Also I'm worried about feeling that if the relationship is ended I'll feel that I've wasted time hoping the negative things would sort themselves out. Just yesterday I found out that a female friend I was attracted to started dating someone else which bothered me more than it should have, from the sense that doors are closing.

TL;DR:"," GF and I have fairly infrequent opportunities to have sex and she's a virgin, I don't see how we can continue a relationship without sex and I'm worried about feeling that if the relationship is ended I'll feel that I've wasted time hoping the negative things would sort themselves out."," 1.5 year, first relationship.

TITLE: Co-worker[F29] is leaving her job shortly. Should I[M26] pursue this?

POST: So here's the situation. I've worked with my co-worker (Rebecca) for about 4 years now. We don't have the same job, but we regularly work together. We'll often start talking about work related stuff and then get side tracked talking about personal stuff for half an hour or longer. 

Over this time I developed feelings for her – we have a lot of similar interests and I really enjoy spending time with her. I haven't acted on them though, as I wasn't sure if the feelings were mutual and I didn't want to jeopardize our working relationship.

Recently Rebecca has decided to quit her job in order to pursue some life goals that our company couldn't accommodate (sorry for being a bit vague here). 

Since she told me this, we've had a couple of conversations that lead me to believe that she might be interested in me. First of all, these conversations have been completely non-work related and the tone was a bit different (hard to explain). Secondly, a co-worker who sits near me overheard a bit of the conversation and said she was totally into me.

This along with some other stuff (she's called me her 'favorite <my occupation>' on more than one occasion) leads me to believe that she might be interested after all.

On the other hand, she's a very friendly person and we haven't really interacted outside of work and work functions.

I'm very inexperienced in this domain, so am I crazy? I'm typically very oblivious about reading social cues, so I wanted a second opinion.

If I do pursue this, given that we already know a decent amount about each other, what's the best way to approach it? Is asking her out for coffee my best option here?

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for a few months. We were hanging out at her place and she went out to pick the pizza I bought. My girlfriend doesn't feel ready to have sex yet so I thought I would quickly jerk of while she was gone to save me feeling frustrated later on in the evening when we normally watch movies and makeout. 

My girlfriends lives in the granny flat bit below her parents house so we have a ton of privacy. I was happily jacking of to my girlfriends underwear thinking she had locked the door on her way out. Turns out she didn't and her mother walked in (without knocking) and caught me right in the middle of everything. She screamed and my girlfriends dad ran down to see what was going on. 

It would have been comical if it wasn't so fucking awful. I was trying to explain myself and her father was yelling at me. Long story short I ended up running because I thought her dad was going to kill me.  

I got a text a few hours ago from my girlfriend saying she didn't think we should be together anymore.

I am beyond devastated. I love my girlfriend and don't want it to end like this. At the same time this is all so fucking embarrassing I don't think I will ever be able to face her family again.

I also left my bag and my laptop at her house and I really need to get it back asap. My bag has a bit of weed in it and I am concerned her parents might find it. I don't know how to ask to get my bag back while still being sensitive. I was thinking maybe I should apologise to her parents?

POST: Hey, guys!

First of all, my friend was in a seven-year relationship, and he was cheated on for two years, and he recently found out (about six months ago). Finding out destroyed him completely, and he only recently began no-contact with his ex-girlfriend.

Now, he and I have had sex three times sober, and a few more times drunk. We're close, and it just sort of began. He's always there for me, and me for him, and we help each other a lot with everything that could be going on. He also takes his time to make sure I feel good, have eaten, telling me I'm beautiful and wonderful. Recently, he told me I deserve the best and that I'm amazing, and that he would love to take a chance at happiness eventually, and that I'd be perfect, but that he isn't ready yet. I also give him plenty of advice about his situation whenever he asks, and I've seen him make progress, slowly.

The problem is, I've started to develop feelings for him, and I don't know what to do about any of this. I'd love to just tell him, but I know he's emotionally unavailable.

POST: My Gf and I have been dating for as year as of the 7th of July. I moved in with her about 2 months into dating and it was good for a while. We were really good friends for about 5 years but we were both dating people at the time and it just didn't go anywhere. But now we are together and things haven't been going as planned.

We would always fight, make-up, and do it all over again. A lot of the problems were with my self consciousness and anger issues. I have worked a lot of them out to try to have a good relationship with her. We are extremely happy with each other about a week and a half per month.

So now, our lease at her apartment is up and we are renting a house together. We were both really excited about it. We move in on the 29th of july and our lease ended on the 8th of July. So there is a 3 week gap and we are forced to stay with our respective parents during the time. This is because we have two dogs. The dogs can't stay at my dad's house, and I cant stay at her dad's house. So we have to be separated. 

This is where the problem started. I would always want to see her but it just didn't seem like she ever wanted to see me at all. Then, the other night it all came out. Turns out she stopped caring about our relationship a while ago and she just didn't care at all anymore. She says that she loves me, and I know she does. So we decide that moving in together again wouldn't be the best decision.

TITLE: (21f) wondering if my feelings for my (22m) boyfriend are lessening or if it's caused by depression

POST: Hi /r/relationships.  

For a bit of backstory, I've had a really difficult time recently - deaths of loved ones, family drama/tension, breakup with an abusive ex boyfriend, just an overall awful year.

I've been with my boyfriend about 9 months.  We were friends for years before we dated and developed an interest in each other.  Our relationship has been pretty happy so far, a couple of blips/arguments but nothing too significant.

Lately I've been feeling more depressed than I ever have in my life.  I used to be pretty easy-going and cried maybe three times a year.  Now I cry every few days and everyday tasks are hugely difficult.  I've lost interest in a lot of my favourite things - example, I'm a classical pianist who has practiced 2 hours every single day since I was five years old, and I haven't touched my piano in months.  I am going to counselling regularly and don't often tell friends and family about my feelings, instead preferring to just deal with it on my own.

Last week I did break down and tell my boyfriend just how bad it was.  He was amazing and kind and comforting and even cried with me while I told him what was going on.  One thing I can't tell him, though, is that sometimes I feel like I don't feel anything for him at all.  Sometimes I feel a lot of love for him, sometimes I feel like I just don't care.  This isn't just limited to him, though - lately I've been feeling almost no affection for my parents or sister and I have very little interest in seeing my friends.

What do I do, Redditors?  With this cloud of depression hanging over my head I just can't trust my feelings at all.  I'm seeing a counsellor regularly but it just doesn't seem like enough to deal with all this.  Anyone ever been in a similar situation?

Also, feel free to ask questions and I'll try to answer them, I'm not sure if I left any important details out.

TITLE: TIFU by falling in love with a lesbian

POST: This happened last summer at UConn. I live in Connecticut.

My bestfriend has a girlfriend, who has an apartment at UConn. I like to drink and got really drunk walking around after we tried to sneak into a bar without paying the upfront tab.

We tried to get in through the kitchen. It smelt like buffalo wings, I led the way.

Non-sequitur. 

We got kicked out almost immediately. Being my drunk self, I lost my friends and made new friends, which I believe were frat boys. 

Drunk dancing like the left shark in the Super Bowl and started talking to hot black girls. They say they have a lesbian friend. Drunk JJ only hears Barney Stinson(I love HIMYM) say ""Make a lesbian straight. Legen-dary."" 

Meet lesbian friend, hook up and dance, fall in drunken love with a girl who is cool. For the first time in my life, my hook up meant something. We talked and I actually liked this girl. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later to a random dorm. She's hooking up with another random dude. And another dude. 

She hooked up with 3 other dudes after me. I don't think she was a lesbian. 

Drunk JJ doesn't care. She jumps on my lap and starts kissing me again after these other dudes. I liked it till I get that I'm being played.

My heart was broken until I realized there's a lot of lesbians I can turn straight. 

After leaving this random dorm, I got attacked by a deer. A deer in the middle of UConn's campus jumped me. I ran away and lived to tell this story to reddit.

POST: Hey reddit, 
Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a relatively short period of time, only about 6 months. Met and started dating pretty quickly, all within about two months. We get along great together, share a lot of interests, goof around a ton, and genuinely care for one another. 

From the beginning it was known that he and his ex gf were on good terms, no hard feelings and she would actually come over to his apartment a lot to hang out with his roommates because they were still good friends. At first this bothered me, but he assured me that it was nothing to worry about and I began to feel a bit more comfortable.

Now he has been hanging out with his ex's roommate (21 female), mostly when me and him aren't together and also at her apartment. Not sure if this is legitimately something to worry about, but for some reason this rubs me the wrong way. I really don't have trust issues with my boyfriend, and believe that he would never cheat on me or anything. I just feel like this relationship (between him and the roommate) would solely be based on his relationship with his ex, and is a person who they have in common and probably talk a lot about. It makes me uneasy, because she obviously would have a bias to talk positively about her roommate/friend, which could in turn make my SO miss his ex. 

Upon writing this, I see how I could come across as jealous- i think it's more of me being insecure. I really just need advice on how not to care about this situation, or steps I could take to feel more comfortable about this relationship my SO wants to keep. 

Thanks for reading guys!

POST: First post :)

I am in college and live in a house literally bordering university property. Next door to us is a stand-alone apartment building with about 8 units inside (unaffiliated with the school).  

Recently, a middle-aged (white trash) couple moved in with their 3 dogs.  Their apartment building has a small yard about the size of ours, however they always walk their dog over to our yard for them to poop, and then they leave it there.  Most of the time I see it through the window, and just as I get up enough courage to go confront them, they're gone.  Today, I came home while they were in the yard, gave her a ಠ_ಠ and asked her politely ""if you're going to let them go here, please at least pick it up"" to which she said ""okay"" and yanked them all on their leashes back to their building.

3 hours later, they're back at it, and not picking it up.  What can I do?  I thought about some sort of pet repellant, but I figured that I don't want to hurt the dogs or make their owners even more abusive to them for not pooping, but they seem to not care that it's property.

As I said don't have many friends, also never been in ""a relationship"" and am a virgin (part my antisocialness, part haven't tried, part don't want someone hanging on me 24/7).. And I feel really shitty about it. Like I'm way falling behind other people my age in these departments. 

I've tried to push myself to ""get over it"" and just deal/be around people more but ugh. Some days I wish I had someone I was close to and other days it's a relief I don't. I don't think I'm asexual, I have sexual *feelings* but not toward anyone in particular. People just annoy me.

Is there something wrong with me for feeling this way? How do I fix it? It's not that I'm afraid of getting close to people. I do that pretty easily actually.  I know this probably comes off as like I am a really SNOBBY person but I'm not. I get along with most people and am friendly.

TITLE: When should I (M34) tell my soon to be ex wife (F33) that I'm in a new relationship?

POST: Long story short, my soon to be ex-wife (married for 8 yrs) and I called it quits in the spring. She moved out of the house (for the second time) over a year ago. We've had issues for the past three years. We haven't been a couple for a long time now and rarely talked in the past year since she moved out. She hasn't been taking this as well as I have been. I was relieved when we decided to divorce as it was so much grief for so very long. I was also the one carrying the relationship. Needless to say, I've been living alone and with the encouragement of my friends and family I started dating at the beginning of the summer. As far as I know, my soon to be ex wife does not know. I do not know if she has been dating either. I have found a really amazing women and we have committed to each other and I can see this new relationship going somewhere. My problem is that I do not want my ex to find out I'm with someone else by seeing us out or by hearing second hand. I want to approach this as the adults we are. However, I am afraid that she'll get very upset and try to take it out on me financially throughout the divorce process. My gut says not to say anything unless it comes up but on the other hand, I want to get this off of my chest so I can be more public about this new relationship. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

TITLE: Good news after interview. Now playing a strange waiting game. What to do?

POST: This story has a timeline of two weeks, starting a week ago on Monday June 1st. I live in Australia, where it is now Thursday 11th. 

Last Monday, I got an interview for a non-advertised entry position at my dream company. All of the stars aligned: It was an emergency for them and I responded the fastest thanks to a friend of a friend that works at said company. 

After presenting them my portfolio, the three people I met with were very enthusiastic, to the point of showing me around the office and introducing me to people. I was told I'd be contacted the following day. 

On Tuesday, I was informed they'd been able to resolve the issue internally but wanted to bring me on board anyway for another project. I was told we would speak very soon. 

On Friday (of what was a long weekend), I was emailed after work hours told that an opportunity had come up for me to come on board and would be contacted on Tuesday. I replied thanking them and saying I hoped to hear from them on Tuesday. 

Tuesday came and went with no phone call or no email. I let it pass because Tuesday was the starting day of the project I was initially being interviewed for (I imagined they were busy trying to make sure it started out right and hadn't had time to get in touch). 

Wednesday passed and I wasn't contacted. 

It is Thursday after lunch and I'm thinking of dropping the person who emailed me last just checking in. 

Should I email today or wait till tomorrow?

TITLE: Why should I even try to help you anymore if you just take your anger out on me

POST: I want my friend back...

He has a terrible home-life and just all in all emotionally unstable. When we first started talking, we had a lot of common interests and just like that he and I were Bonnie and Clyde. Over the past two years though, he has ended up going through a lot of stuff and I ended up becoming his punching bag, his dump bucket, his shoulder to cry on.. I mean, at first  it made me think that maybe I was someone who he could share his feelings in confidence and we were getting closer. But before long he ended up having so many...issues. It just ended up being too much. 

He always dumped on me with his problems, and I would do my best to help him with whatever. Nothing like that happened in my case though when I needed help. I would just get a ""that sucks"" ""sorry about that."" Eventually I began to not share my emotions with him. 

We fought occasionally. At least every other month or so. Usually it was a buildup of emotions on both sides. Something happened at home with him and he took out his anger on somebody. He did things that irked me and I confronted him about it. We would slap a band-aid on it and forget it happened. Finally, he did something to me that was just so unforgivable I couldn't just slap a band-aid and pretend things were okay anymore.

There were many more problems with our friendship and I just finally have to cut this person off because of this. I don't feel good about it. I should but I don't. I want our friendship to be like it was before, but he's just an angry/sad person and I'm just fed up with having to be his punching bag.

Everything she does I just remember how my ex did it and how much more in tune I was with it.

The friend who I was thinking of asking is my oldest friend (since kindergarten) and due to distance we only see each other around one time per year. She has other friends that she considers to be her ""best friends"" but she really understands me and we always have so much fun together. We talk via text a few times a month and skype every once in a while. I know she considers me a close friend too even if not her best friend.

Due to distance I don't expect her to help with preparations (only what she would like to/ is able to). A family friend is already planning a shower. If I was picking one of my bridesmaids to give a toast at the wedding I know that I would want it to be her.

TITLE: My [22F] recent ex [23M] of 3 year relationship suddenly has an attitude about moving out. I am so uncomfortable. What should I do?

POST: My boyfriend of 3 years was blatantly ignoring me and apathetic and I decided to break up with him because I was the only one putting effort into keeping the relationship together. He hurt me (flirting with exes, lying, trying to berate me) way too often and enough was enough. We live together, but he said he would be the one to move out since I'm recovering from an injury and I have fish that would be a pain to move. I told him I want to cut ties and I do not want to talk to him anymore. I do not want to be his friend.

I have heard him sobbing in the other room almost every night since the breakup. We have exchanged some letters but his letters don't make sense. He keeps saying he loves me and he doesn't know what he wants... That his emotions say he's ""making a continuous mistake"" but he is trying to be rational and needs space. He doesn't seem to accept the reality that I am DONE. It's over. I'm ready to move on. I feel like I don't love him anymore. 

Tonight I confronted him because my alternative plan fell through. He said that moving out was not a priority for him. He was very cold about it and seemed to be putting on an act. Is he trying to get in a last ounce of control? 

What are my options? I live in a city where it is hard to find decent rent prices. My cousin agreed to move in with me here, but my ex doesn't seem to want to leave.

I could squeeze into a studio but I'm a student and would be paying way more than I am now. I might reach out to my family to help fund an apartment by myself.

POST: Hi r/relationships,

I recently started dating a GREAT guy. He is thoughtful, interesting, intelligent, and has the biggest heart of anyone that I know. I am so happy and lucky to say that I genuinely mean that. I do not consider this a flaw per se but It's very clear to me that he has pretty severe anxiety. He can get very tense and stressed at times and I feel like there is often no way that I can help. I lay with him and rub his back while he vents but I'm not sure if there's more that I should be doing. 

A few nights ago I noticed some cuts on his upper thighs. They weren't exactly fresh wounds but they definitely weren't old enough to have been there since before we started dating. I didn't say anything (because I didn't want to kill the moment or make him uncomfortable) but I'm not sure if it's my place to say anything. Should I wait until he comes to me? Or should I speak up? He is open with me about his anxiety, so it wouldn't be completely out of left field to talk about this with him. I care about him so unbelievably much and I don't want to make him any more stressed or uncomfortable than he already is. I'm not sure how to handle this.

POST: This actually happened about a month ago, and now that I'm past the disappointment, anger and sadness I thought that everything would be normal again. I no longer have any desire to be with him or date him but because I see him quite often I don't think I've gotten that chance to get over him, so I still like him. 

Even though it's not awkward between us, it's made being around him quite difficult, not to the point where my work is being compromised or anything along those lines, just on a more personal level. He'll be around for the next couple of days and this is causing me to be on edge, which is generally how I feel when I'm around him. That plus vulnerable, small and self-conscious. 

I know rejection sucks and it's meant to sting. For me, this was the first time I took it upon myself to actually ask someone out. Unfortunately I have to face the reminder of my rejection often, so if anyone has any tips on how I can get to a better place with this or at least not feel so on-edge/vulnerable/small/self-conscious about it, I'd love to hear it.

A little BG information: I'm currently doing an internship for school in a small town and have tried occupying my mind with other guys with no success (it's a REALLY small town). Dating isn't in the foreseeable future right now.

We went to the Mc Donald's connected to a BP in our small town and got large soft drinks, then afterwards we decided to go across the street, and down this steep hill to the lake our town sits on. About halfway down this steep-ass hill there was a pot hole. Brock and Kurt went over it with ease, and DJ wanted me to go first. So I thought, being the genius I am, that I could jump the pot hole and sprint down the hill. I would clear the hole and get to the bottom faster. Two birds, one stone right? Wrong-o. ""DJ, hold my drink!"" I said, then I jumped the hole, started sprinting. Now, I think it is important that I mention that I am no stranger to food, I am a heavy set guy. This being said, I realized shit got too real, too fast. I fanatically looked for a way to slow down, and noticed a small tree in front of me... I steam rolled over that like it was a rolling pin going over play-doe. Adding insult to injury, I somehow swallowed a spider that was using the tree as shelter. I then made it to the bottom... on my face. Right into the jagged rocks at the bottom. I rolled right across them. I basically cried and laughed at the same time.

POST: Ok. This is super childish, I know, but I'm pretty rattled about the situation.

The MOH, Erica, has been a terrible person for the duration of the wedding planning. Without getting into too much detail, she has made every aspect of the wedding about her. In addition to this, she has really upset the bride, Ashly, with the financial aspect - Erica can't afford to be in the wedding, but had an absolute fit when she thought she wasn't going to be MOH. Erica and I were close friends for a couple years but have drifted apart due to her moving to a larger city a few hours away. 

So, onto the issue at hand: 

I had bought a few cute outfits for Ashly's kids for Christmas. Ashly didn't know I was getting them anything, it was a surprise. I was pretty excited about the clothes, and had sent Erica a text with a picture of the outfits. 

So, she texts Ashly with, ""so OP got your kids clothes for Christmas, what can I get them that's actually memorable?"". 

Reddit, I know Ashely probably shouldn't have told me Erica said that. And I know I probably shouldn't have called out Erica on how rude she was..... But I did. I was pissed that she ruined my surprise. 

I could write a novel about the aftermath, but Erica flipped her shit on Ashly, and said some pretty mean stuff to her. I feel pretty bad for Ashly. Is there anything I can do to help my friend?

TITLE: 19/M Landed on big right toe while playing sport

POST: First post ever so...

Skip to last 2 paragraphs if you don't want to read so much

So I am a 19 year old male weighing in around 140 pounds with a height of 5' 10"", and recently I hurt my toe while playing soccer tennis (tennis with a soccer ball, lol); what happened was that I kicked the ball with a high kick and then landed a bit awkwardly and with most of my weight on my right big toe.

At first I could not bend my toe and it had begun to swell, next day it had swollen but no bruising, bruising appeared on the next day (mostly on the top had expected the bruising to be on the bottom of the toe), and on the 4th day bruising has disappeared but it was still swollen and basically unmovable/frozen. 

After visiting the doctor on the third day I was informed that it was very likely sprained and/or broken/fractured but have not taken an x-ray because of laziness. At the end of the fourth day I had begun getting very curious as to why I still could not bend my toe so I started bending it and twisting it with my hands, after twisting it hard enough clockwise I heard a loud pop and regained most movement of the toe, and am now curious if it was sprained/fractured to begin with.

So I guess my question is ""Why was my toe locked in position after landing on it awkwardly, and if I am able to move it freely with very slight pain is it sprained at all?"" Most things I search on google about ""locked Toes"" come back with Hallux Rigidus which I am pretty sure is more of an arthritis type of thing and isn't caused by injuries.
I will probably get it x-rayed tommorow... probably

TITLE: I(24) really appreciate my gf(22), but I don't know if I'm wasting her time.

POST: We've been (me M/24, her F/22) together for almost a year now and I've been very happy and excited in the beginning. I appreciate her, because she likes the whole me with every flaw I have. It's worth to note that I'm her first boyfriend.

The problem is that I really don't think that I love her as much as I did before and she certainly loves me way more as I far as I can see it.

I think I might be wasting her time, because I'm constantly thinking of being with other women, but I would never act on it, these are just thought, but they're there nonetheless. I really think this is unfair to her on my part. 

I had only 2 relationships in my life counting this one too, so I'm not experienced one bit. A few people with whom I discussed my problems said that these are not good signs. **What's your opinion?** Would you break up so you don't waste her time or try to work it out somehow?

POST: So growing up I have always had a good relationship with both my parents. They were great parents and there's nothing I can honestly complain about with how they raised me. I was also really close to my Dad when growing up. Please believe me when I say he wasn't always a jerk. He was a good Dad and husband. He taught me a lot and helped me to become the independent person I am today. 

Unfortunately, he is not that person anymore. Over the last two years he has just kind of been gone. He would not come home. for days. If he did come home he was always really drunk. Later I found out he was also under the influence of some drugs. He also cheated on my mom with a girl around my age. 

So I watched my Dad go from a happy-go-lucky guy to a sad, pathetic drunk. In May this all came to a head. It was a really tough time for my family. My Dad eventually told my Mom and I he was going to stop and he was going to get help. So, we tried to rebuild the family. 

I actually got to see my Dad happy again. He stopped drinking and doing drugs. He seemed to be making progress and I was getting ready to forgive him

Well, long story short, he was caught cheating again and doing the previously mentioned things. I just can't handle it. Why did he not just leave back in May? It could of been done with months ago. I just feel even more hurt now. 

I know he does not want me to cut him out of my life, but I don't know what else to do. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? Also, would it be better to just cut him out of my life completely?

On the last night, my dad had gotten properly drunk with some of the locals. On his way back he insisted that we go ""quilling"".

POST: I'm hoping to get some advice on this real estate related question.  My sister and her husband are working on purchasing their first home.  They approached me and asked if I would be willing to help them out with their down payment.  This assistance would be them handing me $5k in cash, and then I write them a check for the $5k and state it was a gift.  They said the broker told them to do this.

Personally, I don't see why something like this would be necessary, and for lack of a better term, seems to be money laundering.  I don't see how them having $5k in cash is any different from them getting ""gifted"" $5k.  Money is money, right?  

From my little bit of google searching it looks like this then requires me to hand over my personal bank records as well to prove where the money came from.  While I don't have anything to hide, it is just more of an invasion of privacy in something I'm otherwise not a part of.

TITLE: Dating: Is my view on wanting my attention to be reciprocated skewed? [25 M]

POST: I am a 25 Male.

If a woman is as intelligent and ambitious as I want her to be, she will see everything that I have to offer her and send me an indication of interest. I am tired of rolling out the red carpet, and I am tired of chasing.

If I ask a girl out on a date and she replies with anything other than ""yes"", or with solid concrete plans, I move on. I think that as I a man, I am socially obligated to make 'the first move'. Thats a given. But I think once I make that first move, if its not reciprocated then I lose interest. If I ask a girl ""when do you want to see me/when are we hanging out next"" and she dosnt give me a solid answer in the future, I stop pursuing. 

If a girl dosnt reply to a text message, I'll text her one more time a day or two later and if she dosnt reply then I'll stop pursuing. 

I have never experienced a relationship in my entire life. But I think that its not wrong of me to expect that a partner be just as enthusiastic as you and with you every step of the way. I hear of men who have been in relationships because they chase and ask the same girl out over and over for weeks/years until they finally give in and they are married. 

Am I being too extreme? Should I still chase girls even after I made my intentions clear? I don't want to be in a relationship if I am doing more than 50% of the work... is this asking too much in modern times?

POST: I have two friends who I've known for over 10 years, but recently I haven't been enjoying the time I've been spending with them.

For a few months when I've gone over to hang out with them, they have been doing the same thing every time; they are playing video games and vaping.  I have nothing against what they do, but it isn't interesting to me.  I just end up sitting on a couch watching them play games for 2-3 hours before I make up some excuse to go home.  We also talk and joke around while they play which I enjoy.  I've tried suggesting alternate things to do, however they usually turn them down.

What makes this such a dilemma is the history we have together.  They were friends who helped me through depression.  There was a time when I wasn't going to school and started being homeschooled because I was too anxious and depressed, but they visited me at least once a week.  I feel indebted to what they did for me.  We've gone on trips together and have a ton of memories that are priceless to me.  I feel obligated to remain their friend.

I also feel like our relationship between the three of us is askew.  They both live together and this has changed how we interact together.  Both of them consider each other brothers, and I am just their friend.  They have so much more in common that I feel isolated.  One of the friends has also been a bit hostile towards me lately.  I used to tease him more than my other friends, but have stopped and made it clear that I am trying to be kinder.  It seems like he is trying to assert dominance or something...I don't know.

Is there any benefit to identifying in my position now, even though I don't require any accommodations currently?

I was in therapy for all my childhood (until 18 basically). it doesn't heavily impact my life as I've learned proper coping mechanisms to help cope with working, and life.

POST: Original post here:

So last night we go to the bar and end up talking all night, eventually the conversation turns to where i thought it might, about how she doesn't want to marry the guy and how she wishes we got a shot. I thought she was just gonna go for it, and I would have to do all the resisting, but she started addressing all my red flags and telling me that's why she can't just break up with the current BF for me. Because she'd feel like a piece of shit for cheating on this guys after breaking up an engagement for him. She already feels shitty enough for cheating once, and she said its her own damn fault for rushing into the rebound relationship without being sure it was what she wanted. Plus she said she's happy with him, and has no way of knowing if she'd be happier with me so its best to just let things run their course naturally. The night ended with us looking at the skyline on the beach, and it was bad. Like we didn't do anything at all, but the tension was too thick so we left.  So now we're in this odd pseudo relationship where we're trying to be friends, and we both agree it would go well for nobody if anything ever happened, but it is a fucking pain in the ass. 

I know I'm under her thumb, but I told her we were ""breaking up"" last night at the beach and that we weren't gonna do this anymore. I know she doesn't mean to lean on me emotionally, its mostly my fault because I haven't had a relationship in about 10 years and I welcomed the company and I can honestly say at worst she's just ignorant of what she's doing.

POST: A couple months ago I exchanged numbers with a woman who works in my building. We tried to set up a date but couldn't work out a time that worked for both of us, so other than grabbing breakfast together once and seeing each other in the lobby/elevator often we haven't spent any time together. 

We had still been texting until a month ago. I had asked if she wanted to grab breakfast again and she texted back saying ""my boyfriend doesn't want me to talk to you anymore,"" which is fair, I didn't know she was in a relationship and my intention wasn't to be just friends, so I just said ok and left it at that. 

I don't want this to be too long so here are the things I've seen that worry me:

1. Boyfriend waits for her at elevators at lunch time every day, heard him go off on her for being late once

2. We've only been in the same elevator twice before today since all of this but both times she had obviously just been crying

3. She used to take breaks to hang out with coworkers and friends, never see her with them anymore

4. Most importantly, when I saw her this morning, she had what looked like a bruise from being choked around her neck. 

I realize that this probably doesn't seem like much, and the bruise could be explained by kinky sex some people have, but together it raises some red flags. I know someone who was in an abusive relationship before and this seems really similar to what she went through. 

Part of me thinks I should say something to her, but I'm not sure it's my place to and I feel I should respect her no contact request. I don't know her very well. Also if I'm wrong I'll come off as a huge jackass. But I also worry that if she doesn't have any friends anymore, she has no one to talk to about it.

I have always tolerated his actions, mostly because I feel as though this was his socially awkward way of developing some sort of friendship with me. He supposedly has been like this with many other people, but only to me in our current friends circle.

I, on the hand, think I have put a lot of effort in being nice back to him despite everything. I have tolerated his unnecessarily mean comments (though I now and then mention that I think he is mean to me), hoping that our friendship would develop into a better one over time. There are some times now and then when he and I get along very well, but it returns to the usual in the couple days.

I thought that our friendship was improving a lot, however recently he acted in a way that I found very insulting. I felt as though he had not respected me as a person and, to an extent, used me. To be honest, I am now unsure of whether he ever valued me as a friend like I thought of him. 

This friendship has a taken a lot out of me over a long time, and now I am uncertain whether I should just give up and kick him out of my life or try to mend it and keep going. I am pretty sure he knows that I have been acting differently (trying to stay away from him), but I also know that he would never take action to see if I was ok. It would have to be me who goes and pours out my heart to him, and hope that he had actually cared for me as friend like I did. 

What should I do? Is a person like this worth it? I had always hoped that we would become good friends, but if it's a relationship like this, I just end up feeling pathetic. 

Would appreciate any advice.

TITLE: Unsure if new relationship will work out, need advice

POST: (I'm 15M she's 14F) So I started dating this girl 3 weeks ago, and I'm unsure if we are compatible. She doesn't seem to trust me by what she says, and we're really different from each other I feel. She's said things like ""I see us lasting a long time"" and stuff like that but yeah. We don't really fight but I feel she's just kind of all over the place as a person. We had an off and on ""thing"" 2 months before we got together. 

She seems pretty happy with us but I'm unsure if I am. She keeps saying things like how she really loves me, and how she think I'm ""the one"" and stuff like that. She's also a little clingy, texts me a little too much. Sometimes her actions and what she says are little too much,(talks too much) gives me this ""woah calm down"" feeling inside. We had sex. (Yes I know I'm too young don't have to tell me) But this is only because she really really wanted to. I've done it with someone else already but she was a virgin. I'm a little worried that this will complicate things, even though we talked about it and how it wouldn't stop us from breaking up if something went wrong.

Now the other part...I realized I still have feelings for another girl that I liked before I dated this girl, and she likes me as well but she's also in a relationship, her relationship is going to end soon though. I think I like her more than my girlfriend...idk how bad that is but yeah. I just really don't know what to do and would love some advice.

TITLE: I [18m] am unsure of how to interpret this situation with [19f].

POST: Hey everyone,

I know these questions are asked often, but like everyone else it seems I am unable to decipher this for myself.

To add a background: I have known this girl for 4/5 years (family friends) and we always got along. 

She got out of a 2 year relationship about 4~months ago, she was broken up with, and I think isnt quite over it yet. Still not too sure about that.

Anyways, we recently have hung about a fair amount and alot of people we know are pairing us up together in their minds and letting us know individually, never when we are together, and we have mentioned it briefly to each other.

Generally I feel like she is acting flirty, although I could be misinterpreting it. However, the thing I have an issue with is that occasionally she still mentions that she loves her ex, this could be her overselling/wanting some level of attention or deflecting from 'us', or she may still be getting over her ex. Additionally she mentions that she doesn't think she will date for a while.

Know, I know this seems like I'm reading too much into her 'flirtatious' actions and she may in fact just be acting friendly. But I wouldn't ask this if I thought that was all there was to it.

So my question is, am I completely off the track? Should I just leave her be? Or should I pay closer attention to the situation?

Generally cliche I know, but any help would be appreciated.

TITLE: Help needed: random aggression in 11 month old Husky/Shepherd mix

POST: My friend picked up a dog two days ago from a shelter, an eleven month old female husky/shepherd (possibly German Shepherd?) mix. She is super sweet most of the time, but she growled at my friend's mother, and at my friend when she was going to pick up a stick, then the dog nipped at one of her friends because the girl tried to push the dog down. The bite ended up drawing blood, and since it was so soon after getting the dog (and apparently the shelter released the dog without her rabies shot), my friend called the shelter to see what to do. They told her she had to quarantine the dog for 10 days, which she had to do at the shelter. When she took the dog in, she described the behavior above and the woman at the shelter strongly recommended turning the dog over to be euthanized because she was too ""unpredictable"" and could be dangerous. My friend felt she didn't have much choice in the matter and turned the dog over. I'm not sure if she can even get her back now (she's in the quarantine process at the moment), but my question is whether there is training that is likely to help this kind of behavior? She showed no aggression towards me whatsoever, but my friend is worried she'll be too dangerous to take out in public or to have people come over. She wants a dog she'd be able to take out with her to public places, but she's also been crying all day about the dog being put down. I'd really like to believe she could train the dog to be better, but is random aggression something that can be gotten rid of? If the responses are unpredictable, what can you really do?

TITLE: Returning to College

POST: I've always been socially isolated (usually a small group of close friends, made up of people who are themselves social outsiders.) In the past two years, I've been on one date; in the past four years, I've been in one relationship; my last sexual encounter was now over six years ago.

I'm now 24, and am about to return to college following a three-year absence (I flunked out cause I wasn't doing any of the work.) I plan to be quite busy, as I'll be pursuing double majors in math and computer science, and would rather not delay my graduation any more than I already have. Still, I figure this is a good chance to get back into the world.

I have a few rules/hangups that might interfere with the, er, sketchier advice people seem to give college guys; they basically boil down to ""I refuse to mischaracterize myself or my intentions,"" ""I refuse to have any romantic or sexual contact with anyone I don't genuinely respect.""

Past that... just looking for general advice on getting out there, meeting people, and moving things forward. I really have no idea how most of this stuff works; I've only been in two relationships, and both of them came about because me and the girl fell for each other so hard that the actual details of what I said/did didn't really matter. I'm woefully unimpressed by what I've seen of the way most people go about this, and am looking for more... open, mature and honest strategies. Theoretically I'm interested in either serious or casual stuff, but it feels like almost everything I have going for me applies more to serious relationships.

More info (my relationship history, my strengths and weaknesses, my looks) on request, but I don't want to make this any longer than necessary. Brutal honesty appreciated, especially if you see a weakness or shortcoming that it doesn't look like I'm aware of.

Anyways, that day I just felt so alone. She would literally stare into blank space instead of looking at me. She wouldn't acknowledge me stroking her leg or anything. All she wanted to do was play mariokart it seemed like.

She had to go home and we didn't finish the conversation, but I told her we need to talk about this face to face and not over messaging and she said okay. The problem with that is, she never has any time to talk face to face because she is in color guard at her school, but I was willing to wait until she did have time.

The next day, I tried talking to her over messaging, not about anything just a ""Hey, How was your day?"" and she blew me off. She said she had too much homework so she couldn't talk to me. I said, ""Okay, sorry, but real quick, can I pick you up from school tomorrow?"" and she said, ""I have things I need to do tomorrow, sorry"".

I said, ""What about our relationship though? We really need to talk."" and that's where she said, ""grades go out Friday, my education and eligibility for color guard are more of a priority right now"".

TITLE: Me [24 F] with my mother [56 F] a few months, highly irresponsible and asking me for money

POST: Hello, it's me again. Please read my first topic on this matter:

Especially the short background info. I've found a flat and moved away from my toxic parents. Everything was great until my mother came back from abroad, where she has a job.

The matter is, I thought she'll forget about the idea of me taking credit for her. Unfortunately I was wrong. Not only the topic returned - she literaly guilts me into this. She keeps talking that she feels like dying, that she stopped eating and she's loosing weight, and that it's probably cancer. All this comes from terrible financial problems she has right now.

To be honest, those terrible financial problems are something I remember from childhood. All my life she had those, and later she stole some amount of money from old employer and was forced to pay it off. To do this, she emigrated and now she earns two times more money than myself. Still, her debts are not getting smaller. They seem just as big as 7 years ago when she left the country. Just now she called me with the news that she needs fast help - she took another loan and now she must quickly pay it off. Of course it's because she didn't read contract carefully enough. That kind of things happen to her all the time.

Unfortunately she knows that I earn stable money. I know that I'm the only one person that can rescue her. Literally no-one in my family is financially reliable apart from me. BUT if I do this, she will make another stupid decision and I will have to rescue her again. I'm not in the position to do this - I ended my education, found a job, moved out and now I'm stabilizing myself financialy after really chaotic childhood and college-hood. I'm not willing to going there again.

I'm seriously thinking about going absolute no-contact with her. I only worry that she could do something to herself... I feel cruel, guilty, ungrateful bitch. I'm her only child.

After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office.

Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it.

TITLE: My boyfriend (29/m) and I (28/f) have been together for a little over 2 yrs, but he has broken up with me several times. Can this be fixed?

POST: It hurts very much every time he breaks up with me. This situation is taking a toll on me and I'd like to hear your thoughts about what's best to do.

Generally, this is what happens: we have an argument and it ends with him breaking up with me. He either goes completely silent or leaves the house for a few days while I am crying/begging him to stay. I know I shouldn't. Twice, I really thought it was over, had stopped all contact with him and he reached out to me.

Last week, right before a camping trip, he threatened to break up with me before the end of the Summer and acted like nothing happened the next morning, being super nice to me. I feel frustrated, because it's like I have to tiptoe around him, he gets angry very quickly, sometimes calls me names in the heat of the moment. He acts nice with me infront of his friends, but otherwise we rarely have one on one dates. I don't mind that he needs alone time since I need a lot of that myself, but it is annoying that he doesn't want to help out with house chores. Furthermore, we aren't sleeping in the same bed nor does he seem enthused to get intimate. For the last part, it might just be my impression since I don't know how I feel about that myself with everything that has happened. 

I don't know what to think: are relationships this messy and am I just making too big of a deal out of this?

Finally, I feel very vulnerable since my job contract ended unexpectedly about a month ago and maybe that puts more of a restrain on the relationship. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts about whether this relationship can be fixed or not. Feel free to ask questions if I left out some important details. Thank you for reading me.

POST: We have dated for 5 month now and she is my official GF for 1,5month and I am afraid I might get over-attached and that I am turning into someone I do not want to be. One example, an old-highschool friend visited her and they went out partying (I went somewhere else) and he spent the night at her place (we dont live together and he doesnt live close). I am totally okay with that and I know that since she only has one huge bed and no couch that he slept in one bed with her. I trust her and I know that she would never cheat on me but still I become paranoid. She accidentally called me by his name today (and she was so embarrassed and sorry) and that freaked me the fuck out. I know that she loves me a lot and she told me that she never felt that much in love before and I believe her. Why do I still become paranoid? I couldnt sleep tonight because I was creating scenarios in my head in which she cheated on me or something else bad happened.

Do I have self-esteem issues or something?

I am someone who needs a lot of freedom in relationships. If I wanted to visit a female friend and platonically spend the night and I couldn't because my GF wouldnt let me, I would be so annoyed, so it seems just natural to me to give her the same freedom I am expecting of her but why can't I just be cooler about this? It feels like my emotional shields protecting me from my own paranoia are completely shut down. It feels a little like I am tripping out on MDMA or something.

POST: Apologies if this belongs in /r/sex - I wasn't sure.

We've been together ~5 months and have great communication about everything but our sex life, which hasn't been going amazingly. I took his virginity, but he's not the first guy I've been with.

 I'm into some basic kinky stuff, nothing too ""out there"", I would just enjoy some light bondage, spanking, dirty talk, etc. A week or so ago I brought up the topic of kinks and encouraged him to talk about specific fantasies he has...all he came up with was telling me his favorite position thus far (missionary, incidentally) and that he really is not into the whole dominance/submission power play thing, which was a little disappointing. Now I feel awkward talking about stuff I want to try because I really doubt he'd be into it...how can I bring this up?

TITLE: Should I give my father money for rent?

POST: Need some help, reddit.

My father, pushing 60, just asked my brother and I for money to pay for 3 months worth of back due rent. Total: $1,350.

A little backstory: he used to work for a large multinational but got canned about 8 years ago. He got severance and he decided to start his own business with it, which failed in about a year. He spent all of his severance on it. He now has another business which is obviously not yielding enough cash. He's also currently looking for a job.

He's re-married, to someone about 5 years my senior... She doesn't really work, but does some free-lance stuff, so ""she's been paying the bills"", according to my Dad. She recently took $30,000 from an older family member of hers to buy a car. She also frequently travels by invitation from this family member. (e.g. this family member pays for it...)

I know that I will not *loan* my father any money, but just give it to him if my wife and I decide to do so. However, I don't see an end to this unless he makes some drastic changes. It seems he believes he will get different results by doing the same thing over and over, and frankly I don't see that he's *killing himself* to improve his situation.

However, if I don't help him out, he will probably not pay rent and get kicked out. He also won't have money for a new place...

What's also interesting to note is that my father, when he was doing well, gave his father (my grandfather) money every month to help *him* out. I don't want to do the same: I have my own family and life to take care of.

So, reddit, what to do? Anyone else been in a similar situation? Your thoughts, please?

TITLE: My [21 F] boyfriend [24 M] of three months has taken a new job and can now only see me once a week, sometimes only once every two weeks

POST: I'd like to begin by saying I don't want any answers that just say 'break up', I want some actual advice on the situation and how to make it work, without having to break up. I believe this issue can be fixed, I'd just like some ideas as to how...

My boyfriend and I have been together for around three months. We're genuinely happy in the relationship, except for one gaping problem that has arisen in the last month.

He's taken on a new job, one that requires him to work six days a week between 2pm and 8:30pm (sometimes starting a little earlier). This means we usually only have one day to meet up per week because I have uni most mornings, and the physically demanding nature of the job means he's usually too tired to do anything when he arrives home at night.

In fact, sometimes we only see each other once every two weeks, if he gets called into work on his day off, or if he makes plans to see his friends/family. 

(and before anyone says anything, i know for a fact that he's not seeing somebody else. i won't get into it here but we can rule that one out)

I'm not gonna lie, I hate this. He hates it too. We love being around each other. We're generally really happy in our relationship, and at the risk of sounding needy, I'd spend every waking moment of every day with him if I could. But surely wanting to see your boyfriend more than once a week, or once every two weeks, is not too much to ask?! We're not a long-distance relationship, in fact we only live 10 minutes from each other, so we'd love to try and fix this.

Any ideas?

POST: Hi there,
4 months ago my partner of 5.5 years left me to pursue a relationship with a girl from work. As I know, he didn't *actually* cheat on me, however in my heart it feels the same--if not worse because he actually PURSUED a relationship, not just sex. He said he regretted it pretty early on but they continued to be together for two months, and not once did he try to contact me to work things out. 

It was short lived, apparently, and he's back saying he fucked up and he realized his mistakes and ""realized"" that what we have is a once in a lifetime sort of thing. I'm hesitant. I feel so hurt and betrayed, and I feel very disillusioned about our relationship in general. I love him and I am still so very much in love with him, but I just don't really feel as though he won't ever experience grass is greener syndrome again. But then again, we are still young and immature with how we handle things so maybe he did really learn?

So what I'm really asking is to hear about others' experiences with a situation such as this. Is it worth giving him a second chance?

POST: Throw away because this disgusts me.

It's been going on for a while and I've always been on the fence about saying anything. I don't know what would be the right thing. should I tell him? I've always been on the verge of telling him, but there are some seriously fucked up factors in this and I've think it's getting worse.

I'm not sure if she would be with him if it weren't for factors like housing and security giving how frequently she cheats and the fact that whenever she does something 'fun' without her children she never invites him. She has ignored him on multiple occasions besides that when he'd tried to figure out where she was.

Now she's pregnant and the child might not even be his, but this would be what he thinks is his first child. My indirect involvement in this because I'm her brother makes me feel like shit. He gives her children love even though they aren't his and she cheats on him. When she had her second child and she wasn't sure who the father was he took responsibility. She could've just have not been with him. I feel as though she's using him and wasting his life away.

POST: (Throw away because she's a redditor and a power user, might not work but oh well. Also it's kinda long)

Me and her met on an online dating site and talked for a week and finally decided to go out and have dinner at this pretty nice/new italian restaurant downtown. Had a great time and was the best time I ever had in over 4 years (crippling depression and what not.) In short, me and her we're the exact same in every way in terms of interests. It's weird as if life finally gave me a break and said ""Hey I'm sorry about that, here's an amazing, loving girl with your brain, sorry about the past!""

We did so much together in these (almost) 4 months and fell madly in love with each other. It was like some sloppily written cliche riddled romance movie. We never argued or had problems it seemed. This is where I'm lost and that rant before this is why I'm disbelief on why this is even happening. 

Anyway, previous to this morning we talked and saw each other all the time constantly since the first date. Sent her a text when I woke up, 4 hours go by and I text her again. This time shortly after all she said in a long message that ""I need time to think"" and that she doesn't ""know anymore and need's time"". She's never talked like this and it's so random. Normally that's an obvious red flag but it's just so strange and sudden after what was perfect. It make's no sense. Have I been punk'd? I don't understand where this is coming from.  She never did anything or said anything wrong and neither did I (I think?).

TITLE: My (31m) roommate's (31m) guest never leaves my apartment. Going on 2 weeks now and I'm annoyed

POST: Hey everyone. My roommate and I are coming to the end of 2 years of living together. Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.

We used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.

He's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.

So here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)

Here we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.

I'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.

My friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.

TITLE: TIFU by accidentally overdosing on dextroamphetamine (ADD medication) on the day of my endwork presentation. [NSFW]

POST: So yesterday was a rough day. I still had a LOT of work to do, things like making the actual scale model of the home design I presented today and the powerpoint presentation.

I was able to make a presentable presentation, but only got 4 hours of sleep because of it. I think the lack of sleep is what caused my body to be incapable of processing my normally prescribed dosage this morning.

So today as I arrived at school I already knew I was sweating a hell of a lot more than I was supposed to. Feeling cold and sweaty is a miserable feeling. Though I assumed it was just a common cold or something. That all changed when I checked my armpits. Seriously I regret wearing a gray shirt today.

My armpits were just *drained* with sweat.

I could feel the sweat drip down my arm pits drop by drop every minute, what just made more nervous. After an hour my sweater was no longer able to contain the sweat, and it was so visible I didn't even need to lift my arms for people to notice. It didn't make me feel awkward towards my friends, I just laugh it off with them.

But then it was time for me to present my design to the external jury. 7 well respected teachers and architects gave me 30 min of their time for me to defend my work.

I just know that they noticed it and it distracted them and it distracted me. Too awkward for them to mention it. Too awkward for me to not ignore it. Yet I accepted the awkwardness and was able to give a somewhat terrible presentation because I got verbal ticks along with the overdose. But they loved the design at least after I explained everything twice.

After school was done I took a piss before I went home, which was also a bad idea. It felt like passing a kidney stone and gave me a throbbing painful erection for a good 30 minutes.

Now here I am, sitting at home because I can't stop sweating, feeling exhausted, heartbeat still around 100.
I'm just having a bad day.

TITLE: My girlfriend of 2 years [17/F] is spending time with a guy who likes her/she used to like (not sure if she still does). Am I [17/M] wrong in being angry/jealous?

POST: Recently (this past month), my girlfriend has been hanging out a bit with a guy who tried to ask her out earlier this year.  They have been friends for as long as her and I have been dating, and I found out in late-2011 that she had a bit of a crush on him.  I expressed how that made me feel a bit uncomfortable in a calm way at that time and she understood.  They didn't talk quite as much and that made me feel a bit better.  

Fast forward to earlier this month, they are both in our school's choir program and went on a field trip to sing.  It went until later in the day, and the guy offered my girlfriend a ride home.  Since he had tried to ask her out earlier this year, that made me feel a bit uncomfortable, but I let it slide.  They went to the movies, and he paid for the both of them before she was home, which added to the jealousy a bit.  

Yesterday was the last day of our school year, and she told me that she was going to the guy's house to watch some old movie.  I told her I felt it was inappropriate, and we then went back and forth a bit before she called me stupid.  Childishly enough, I just shouted the insult back at her.  She stormed off, and we haven't spoken since.  I'm not sure what to do; we've been together a long time and I feel very strongly for her, but knowing her, this kind of event will happen many times throughout this summer.  I don't know if I can trust her, and I kind of want to break it off at this point.  I'd really like some outside opinions on this matter.

POST: So for the last 2-3 years I have had one tonsil that is always swollen. At first I assumed it was from smoking (I'm not a heavy smoker, maybe a few a day for several years, with plenty of week-long breaks) so I quit. It  got better but not completely better, it was still visible in the back of my throat while the other wasn't. I went to the doctor who prescribed antibiotics (which didn't do much). She said there's no reason to do anything  about it unless it's bothering me enough to want surgery. I probably should've mentioned to her  that I smoke but I didn't think of it at the time. I highly doubt  it's cancer though, I'm young and healthy other than the smoking (I know that sounds ridiculous  haha)

Since then, I've been an on-and-off smoker (mostly during exams or nights of drinking) and sometimes my tonsil is fine but  other times, like right now, it gets really swollen and uncomfortable. I know that I should stop smoking and that's the plan, but for now can anyone offer  any ideas as to  what's causing this? Or any advice on how to reduce swelling?

Basically, most of my life I've been skinny fat, usually staying around 130ish at 5'7"" but I've never looked toned or lean and have always felt as though I've needed to lose 10-15 pounds. 

In hs I played tennis a lot and I suppose my legs were toned then but in college I didn't work out at all. Fortunately I also ate less in college so I never really gained weight until recently (that's another story).

My goal is to finally get a toned beach body but I've heard conflicting advice on how to do this. Basically people are telling me that I shouldn't try to lose anymore weight, but should just gain muscle and this will help me reach my desired goal. 

However, I think that I should lean up first and lose 10-15 pounds because I definitely have a thick layer of fat covering everything. I doubt I could have visible abs at this point. My goal is basically to get down to 117 pounds (I'm 140.5 now) through cardio and calorie counting (MFP) and then gain 2-3 pounds of muscle to get to 119-120. I'm wondering if this strategy will give me what I want.

TITLE: Revenge ideas for a pompous boss.

POST: Dear Reddit:

Heres the sitch. So my co-worker and I made a friendly bet with one of our bosses. We work in a Physiotherapy Clinic and we have 3 members of the same family coming in to see him so I piped up and said?I b et you can?t get the mom to make an appointment? and so it began. We drew up a contract that stated that the mom must make an appointment before 5pm on Thursday July 12, 2012. If she made the appointment my co-worker and I would have to call our boss?Supreme Master of the Universe? for 2 straight days. If she did not make the appointment he had to sing every single request for us for 2 straight days. So she leaves and makes an appt for her and we all think the bet is over. He won. He cashes in on his bet for the next 2 days. It is now 3 days later and I find out she cancelled her appointment but he never told anyone. I need a seriously good retaliation for this. It will not go unnoticed. He can definatly take a joke and is extremely pompous. I need your ideas to exact revenge.

TITLE: I [24f] recently joined a tennis league with lots of older women. Opponents [40s+] keep questioning my age. How to respond?

POST: Like the title says, I'm 23. I look my age. I recently decided to get back into tennis since I stopped playing throughout college and wanted to introduce some sort of athletic activity into my life while avoiding my least favorite things in the whole world: getting fat and running. Everyone on my league team is very nice, although I do seem to be the youngest. (Ages range from 27 - 40s.) That's fine and no one has made comments.

The past couple weeks we've had matches against other teams that seem to consist of older women (40s - 60s). At each of these matches, one of my opponents has, at some point, asked: ""Are you even 18?!"" I don't really understand why they're saying this - to discredit me if me and my partner are winning? - but they're often very persistent. Not persistent enough to question my presence on the team, but enough to make me uncomfortable with their faux-joking. 

Even though it makes me uncomfortable in the moment, this isn't hovering over me or haunting my dreams. I just need some suggestions on how to shut this kind of thing down, especially with some quippy one-liner or something. I wrote the first time off but am now 2 for 2 at matches and so want to be prepared for the next time, since I'm assuming there will be one. Last time it happened, I tried to ask if they wanted to see my birth certificate but I don't think they really heard me. Awkward.

TL;DR:"," recently got back into tennis after a long-term break and have opponents who are often very persistent questioning my age. How do I respond when they make comments like ""Are you even 18?""?", Older women tennis opponents keep accusing me of not being 18 even though I am a full-blown grown-up woman with the student debt to prove it?

We went to the movie theater one day and he complained that someone took a picture of him. He thought he was being spied on and wanted to leave. (There was no one there, it was in his mind)

Our family got a call yesterday, and it seems now he won't even leave his trailer to get food. He told the neighbor that the voices told him to stand in a hole in his house to keep people away. He's getting worse, and tomorrow I'm going to be going with my mom and anut to help deal with the situation.

POST: My boyfriend and I have been living with relatives for over a year. It has been a great way for me to build my savings nest, get on my feet financially and with my career, and of course to have much lower expenses. My boyfriend also recently got a new job. He seemed just as enthusiastic as I did about moving out, saving up, and getting our own place. We also seemed to share the same dislike of frivolousness.

Cue my red flag: yesterday he informed me that he spent over 1k on an outfit for an event that we are going to. I don't feel that he will use this outfit enough to justify the price tag. I also feel like that money would have been better spent on the apartment that we have talked so much about getting together. Now I don't think he takes finances seriously, and that he is short-sighted with his money. Am I over-reacting? This is potentially a huge deal breaker for me because I personally feel that bad financial judgement is indicative of larger issues.

TITLE: My (27M) coworker (29F) keeps asking me what to do about her husband's (30ish M) behavior.

POST: Background:  She's been married for a few years.   It was an arranged marriage.  She has a kid.  She was already a US citizen and her husband wasn't.   He has citizenship now.  I don't know her husband, but I've met him once and I usually follow my instinct when I meet people because it's never been wrong.  I didn't like this guy.  

Problem according to my coworker:  This guy flirts with other girls constantly on Facebook.  He talks to girls back in India and random girls on Facebook.   He did most of this behind her back.   When she found out, she was crushed, but gave him a chance to fix it.   One year later he hasn't stopped and made multiple accounts.  She read over these messages when she gets on the computer. 

She kept giving him a chance over and over because she loves him.   She talked to his parents and her parents because it's customary in their culture.   Her parents were disgusted by his behavior.   His parents said, ""well, he hasn't done anything yet so what's the problem?""  

She says that he used her to get citizenship so he can move his family here.   She even signed the papers this year to get them a green card.  She says she doesn't know what to do anymore. 

My opinion:  She should just divorce the guy.   He makes her feel like shit all of the time.   He's cheating on her on an emotional level.  He obviously has zero respect for her.   She's financially stable by herself.  She has resources to take care of her kid.

TITLE: My mother [45F] wants to use me [16M] to force her religion onto my girlfriend of 18 months[16F]

POST: My girlfriend is Catholic, my mother is a conservative evangelical Christian, and I'm an atheist (Though I'm not telling my mother that until she no longer has power over me). My mother pesters me to invite her to our church, and has been growing increasingly forceful and is making veiled threats to forced to break up with her.

I can't exactly reason with her. She will never entertain the possibility that I'm right about something and will shout and bully people into silence. She vents her anger onto the people around her, which is problematic given that people disagreeing with her pisses her off like nothing else. I recognize that she's a toxic person, as awful as I feel for thinking that.

She resorts to screaming insults at me if she gets too upset. She belittles me, She has a tantrum, reduces me to tears, and then when she calms down she begs for forgiveness. It's not because she's genuinely sorry. It's not about me. It's about her and how she feels like a bad mother. So she pretends to be sorry and I pretend to forgive her.  I feel guilty for being this bitter towards her.

My girlfriend is a rather liberal catholic. She views Catholicism as a cultural identity mostly, in actual religious terms she's more of a universalist. Breaking up with her is not an acceptable course of action. I've grown far too close to her to accept losing her.
   

I've been getting by with saying that denomination is insignificant, but I doubt she'll accept that for too long. I have no qualms about lying to her to get her to leave me alone. I just want her to drop it.

TITLE: I'm [M20] worried about emotional manipulation from girlfriend [F20].

POST: I've found recently that my girlfriend has been saying things which make me feel uncomfortable dye to the way they're said. We're not doing great at the minute so I'm concerned this is changing my thinking. 

Essentially, we had an argument recently and now talking between us is more stilted (we're in different countries right now, by the way). The things that have me worried are when she says things like she needs to talk to me to distract her from thinking about hurting herself and that she ""hopes I know"" she's depending on me to make her happy. 

I don't want to seem overly selfish, I'm concerned about that. Of course I want to help and I have for as long as we have been dating (around a year and a half now). It just feels like some of these things are more of a threat than asking for help. This is partially caused by the fact that when I try to offer suggestions they're met with rejection as being too hard, not what she wants as the solution or simply as not going to work. 

I feel guilty writing this and I feel guiltier that I've been considering the future of our relationship recently. It feels like she's making sure I know just how guilty I should feel if I left. This is made worse by her recently accusing me of fostering her dependency on me while I'm not dependant on her (I'm not sure how I did this and when I tried to offer her ways of becoming more independent they were shot down). 

Am I being selfish here and thinking too much about my self, not enough about her? I do want to help and I don't want to make it all about me but these thoughts keep coming back to me. I'm not sure what to do so any advice is appreciated. 
Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

TITLE: Me [25M] with my girlfriend [25F] 1yr, fucked up by talking to someone I shouldn't have. Need to rebuild trust

POST: I've been dating my gf for a year. we've lived together since September.

From mid-October to end of November, we were in a really rough patch where we were both working our asses off. She had family things happening at the same time, and it all came together in a perfect storm that took itself out on our relationship.

Unfortunately, her stress was often vented onto me so I felt pretty inadequate. Our sex life suffered, I felt like I was turning into a really horrible boyfriend when I wasn't really, and I was feeling pushed away. Angry and in need of some kind of positive attention, I turned to a friend living overseas who I had had an on/off casual relationship with for 2 years, which ended 1 yr before I started my current relationship. I initiated and we sent messages back and forth here and there for approximately 3 weeks. They were long messages, sometimes lightly flirtatious, which is what I was looking for. After a week or so I knew I was wrong to have started it but I was enjoying catching up with a friend--which is what it had become.

The friend was home for Christmas and we both suggested meeting. I downgraded from a drink because i thought it would be inappropriate, and if we had actually decided to have lunch I would have asked my girlfriend's permission and finally spilled the beans on what I had done, kiboshing the entire thing if she said I should. 

Instead, she caught me red handed. We talked things through after i had a sleepless night on the couch and we are staying together, despite what she feels is emotional cheating. I love my girlfriend to the moon and back and this was a major mistake. Obviously rebuilding trust is a long process, but any advice on small acts or suggestions for things I need to keep in mind would be welcome.

TITLE: Is it possible to be married but live apart? I'm 29/F, husband 35/M

POST: My husband posted on here about this a few days ago, but left out a lot of details so I'm just going to ask my own question:

What's it like to be married and live in separate homes?

Backstory: We married November 1st and I instantly started having major health issues. I did NOT know he was miserable at his job and trying to avoid telling me about it so I could fight through my issues, so fell into a deep depression, which I couldn't see. Obviously this made things worse, involved some funny activity on our bank account (mistake #1 -- we should not have combined finances!) and caused him to start lying a lot. I got better in January-ish, but he was totally absent -- I wasn't allowed to have feelings, etc etc. 

I moved out in early February and filed for divorce on March 1st (but isn't finalized until we sign papers, which would be at the soonest June 1st.) We spent about 2-3 weeks apart before I finally called him to talk. I had been in therapy and so had he -- and we had both grown and realized SO much. I had issues stemming from my parents and so did he. My own negativity was because of my relationship with my mom (I haven't talked to her in 2 weeks now -- planning no contact with her and communicating only with dad) and he's become -- this sounds so cheesy -- just the most AWESOME person.

I've already signed a lease on my own place and he's living with friends in a very healthy house (literally -- everyone eats really well, sleeps by 10pm, etc.). 

For us, I think we need our own spaces to keep growing and healing and find our own happiness -- mostly because we both never HAD space as adults (he's 35, I'm almost 30) and we want to be able to have an awesome marriage. Living together might actually hinder the process we're making in therapy and the ability to learn how to be OURSELVES.

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my ex [19 F] of 8 months, she just broke up with me because of music

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. It's been great. We fell in love and spent every waking moment together whatever chance we got. I met her family, she met my family, we've been on trips together... you get the idea. 

Well, lately, she's been demanding me to make compromises in everyday things (movies, hobbies, etc.) in order to appease her. Now I told her that who she's suggesting I be is just not'me' and that I'm not comfortable with her dictating how I live my life. 

She insists that she knows what's best for me and that I need to start living like an adult, whatever that means. In the meantime, she starts pushing her hobbies and media interests on me. ""No, let's listen to this"" she'll say in the car while we're playing the radio, or ""Why do you go to the gym so often? Stay home, babe, and watch New Girl with me.""

This behavior is starting to aggravate me and I begin denying her requests. She starts getting more belligerent in her remarks and starts guilt tripping me, telling me ""You don't care about me, you're so inconsiderate to my feelings."" 

About a week later I'm driving her home and she's playing some god awful pop radio station I've never heard of. I get this funny idea to play ""Kill You"" by Eminem on full blast while we're driving through the neighborhood because at this point I don't care anymore. She starts yelling something at me but I can't hear her over the music, plus I have the windows open. 

All we hear is ""Sl*t, you think I won't choke no wh*re?!? Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more??!"". The look of resolve and assertiveness on her face dissolved completely, she was in horror and I was laughing my ass off. At one point she started screeching and assaulting me as I repelled her from the sound control panel.

TITLE: I want to look into some education options for system administrators.  Can someone elaborate on my options for me?

POST: A little bit of background for you.  I graduated with a bachelor's in technical writing but did tech support for Dell for about a year before getting into my tech writing gig.  I've always been the guy that is never sure what his strengths are, or what he wants to do for the rest of his life.  I know I love computers and after transferring out of my tech writing position into a sales position, I know that I want out.

I have the option of going back to my old job, but even then I don't really see myself there long-term.  I am looking at some AA degrees from my local community college.  

In case you are still with me, here is my dilemma.  I know I am a professional adult who is employable, but I don't know which field really interests me.  The available tracks are: cisco and telecommunications, Microsoft certified systems engineer, unix/linux system administration.  Unix/Linux admin & MCSE interests me more than Cisco.  I'm very interested working in a Windows environment (but that is probably just because what I am used to... I rarely use linux).

TITLE: What the hell can I do?

POST: I teach art lessons to underprivileged youths at a nearby elementary school through an organization at my university. After only ever teaching in middle/upper class areas, working with these kids has been a very eye-opening experience. I'll cut to the chase though... Today was my last day working with this particular class of kids, and one table started talking about when they were afraid of their parents. Two girls admitted that their parents regularly belted them, with one also saying her dad whipped her with metal wire, too, and the other saying her dad pounded her hand with a brick. When I tried to tell them that it was wrong for their parents to hurt them and told them it's illegal, they disagreed and thought it wasn't illegal. Yet another started crying when she got a somewhat poor progress report she had to take home for her parents to sign, saying her dad was going to beat her like he usually did. A different girl also told me that her mom calls her a ""fat bitch"" and that her dad was deported and went to jail after trying to kill her mother.

I asked the graduate student who serves as supervisor of the other undergraduate mentors like me what, if anything, I should do. Her exact words were, ""If you didn't see bruises, you can't say shit."" In a sad way I agree, and I realize I also have no proof that these kids are telling the truth, although they seemed serious. But thinking about some man taking a brick to a 9 year-old girl just makes me sick.
So I thought I'd ask you, Reddit. What can or should I do? I need some peace of mind.

TITLE: Have I got it all wrong?

POST: Obvious throw away account because I post and comment allot and just need some quick advice. 

So a while ago I made an OKCupid account and started talking to some people there. I met this one girl who seemed really awesome. We started meeting up and have become quite good friends. 

About a month ago I invited her over to my place to hang out, watch a movie, jam on guitar etc etc. The evening went really well and when she sent me a message not 10 mins after leaving saying that she really enjoyed herself. So, I bit the bullet and decided to tell her how I felt. All I got from her was that we have loads in common but she's happier with us as friends at the moment. I was kind of bummed because we seemed to get on so well and have something going. 

Thinking that was it, I put it out of my mind (after much difficulty) and got on with things. We went out again just before I graduated and spent the entire day together walking in London and sitting around in parks. It was really great and it's frustrating how well we get on, knowing that she doesn't want anything more.

After this I went travelling for a few months (post-graduation trip). Whilst I was away she got in touch asking me out again. This is where my problem is, we went out and again spent hours just sitting around chatting. I can't help but think maybe I've done something wrong, or have I just got the wrong idea? I asked her out to a gig tonight and even though she's got something else on she's cutting it short to come and hang out. I just don't know what to think. When we're together things seem amazing but when I asked her about it she wasn't so sure. 

I should say that she's very shy and I believe her previous relationship was quite a serious long one (5 years or so).

Thanks for any advice the great hive mind of Reddit can give!

TITLE: 16 year old friend of my brother takes massive dump, uses our vacuum to suck up the shitty water. Mom doesn't want to call him out to protect my brother. What can I do?

POST: I live away from home. My mom  calls me tonight and tells me this story:

So he came over for a sleep over. Took a massive dump in the bathroom, saw the water wasn't going down and instead of using the plunger, went back to sleep. Next day he and my mom tried to plunge the sucker but it would not budge. She had to leave to go to the gym and in the meantime he used our central vacuum (not a cheap toy) to suck up the shitty water before it overflowed.

Filled a fair amount of the tank, which is in the garage. Didn't tell a soul. 3 weeks of crazy heat wave weather later, mom goes into the garage and smells death. She thinks ""Hey, I also havent emptied this tank in months, I should check it"". This woman, with a terrible spine, proceeds to lift what she thought was a light tank, and is stuck with 40lbs of liquid. The smell hits her. She somehow manages to unhook it and spends 2 hrs cleaning the fucker. Thank goodness she works in the healthcare industry and knows how to deal with this hazard.

I asked her if she's going to call the kid's parents or talk to the kid. She doesn't want my brother to be mocked as a taddler (highschool is plai ol' retarded and he is relatively popular) so she simply is banning the kid from the house.

I can't just sit here and let this happen without any responsibility on the kid! My dad is gone for a year long tour in Africa so it's not like he can step in and scare the kid straight.

TITLE: Me 26M with my girlfriend 25F of 4 months, wants me to go to her grandmother's funeral but i haven't met her family

POST: So my girlfriend has anxiety and is very emotional. I tend to solve problems more logically etc. Anyways, she asked if I'd go to her grandmother's funeral depending on when it was. Her grandma is currently in hospice so the time is coming soon. I've never been to a funeral before and I've never met my girlfriend's family.

The twist is that she doesn't have a good relationship with her dad and refuses to talk to him. This creates tension with her mom and her sister who live with her dad. I don't really think it's appropriate to be meeting her family at a funeral and I don't know her grandma at all. I told my girlfriend I'd take off work or whatever possible to be there for her after she gets home from the funeral (we don't live together). However, she started crying saying she really needs me there and needs someone to hold her hand. 

While I understand the logic behind this, it's also a big deal for me because 1. Her dad and her are in a feud and I really don't want to be a part of any sort of family drama at a funeral. 2. Meeting her mom and her sister or any family at her mom's funeral is going to be weird to me. Everyone's going to be crying and I don't know any of them yet, so the first time I meet them all it's going to be really sad. 3. I've never been to a funeral before and the closest thing is being in the room while putting my favorite childhood dog down with my family.

Girlfriend got really upset when I told her these reasons and said she expects to have a boyfriend who is there to support her. I understand her perspective which is why I offered to be there for her after she gets back. But she really wants to hold hands during the funeral itself.

Don't know what to do! I told her I'd think about it more, but she is still upset that she might have to 'ask someone else to go with her'.

POST: So I dated this really beautiful girl last fall for about a month or so, things didn't really work out due to timing and she moved back home to take care of her sick mother. Recently, about two months ago, we started chatting again and it got sexual...starting sexting and exchanging photos, with making plans for her to come up and visit me and have sex (we did not have sex when dating, though we did other things of that nature, just not intercourse). 

Well, I saw her briefly when she was in town a week ago for work and it really hit me that she is in a very vulnerable place right now due to her mom's situation. And that maybe having sex with her wouldn't be the best idea or would be taking advantage of her. I'm worried she may have reconnected and started this sexual stuff with me because she isn't doing well at the moment and this was a way of coping. It was clear to me when we met up that she is pretty vulnerable and not just the kind of person to have sex for the fun of it. The thing is, I may be moving in a few months, so if she does come back to the city we couldn't be together in a serious way and I don't want to sleep with her when she is vulnerable like this, then not be there for her in the long-term.

POST: **Background**: When I met this girl (at college) she had a long-distance, long-term boyfriend with whom she was in an open relationship. We started hooking up exclusively but had many ups and downs due to her not wanting to jeopardize her feelings for her boyfriend. *Her interactions with me and her boyfriend are not the topic of discussion for today.* They broke up this summer and after a long period spent getting over some associated guilt and hurt feelings, she and I agreed that we would try to be together this fall.

**Issue at hand:** She feels that I hold a grudge against every person she's ever hooked up with other than me. This argument popped up because I brought up a one night stand she had this summer after her break up with her ex, me kind of overstating my jealousy of this hookup because I had ""existed"" at that point. I told her I disliked the idea of her kissing him or looking at him in the ways that we shared. It was all a little overstated maybe.

TITLE: [Georgia] Additional charge appears on Acknowledgement of Court Date document after case rescheduling

POST: My girlfriend committed simple battery this Spring after punching another woman at a bar in here in Georgia.

A few days after the incident, she was contacted by a police officer who informed her she had a warrant for her arrest. She turned herself in and spent 24 hours in jail before her initial hearing inside of the jail where she was informed of the charge against her. She was released and went home to await her court date.

Flash forward to last month. She went to court on her scheduled date but was informed that her case was not ready and would be postponed for another three months. She was directed to the solicitor's office, where she was given an Acknowledgement of Court Date document (not sure if that's the actual title, but it included information about the arraignment rescheduling on it). That document, in addition to listing the revised date and time, also lists the charges she's facing. When she looked at the paper, she noticed a new charge had been included alongside the simple battery, masturbation for hire.

No where, not on the officer's report of the incident, nor the county court case website system, is there any mention of this charge, only on this scheduling document. She contacted her arresting officer, who said he did not arrest her for or charge her for it.

This document was hand written by someone in the solicitor's office, not printed from a computer, which leads me to believe it's a simple clerical error.

My question is how can we be certain that this charge was not erroneously added and will be brought up at her arraignment? If it is a clerical error as I suspect, is there anything we can do to petition the county to remove it or to ensure that the charge doesn't actually exist somewhere official?

Any advice would be most appreciated.

TITLE: Me [00 M/F] with my ___ [00 M/F] duration, short-description Me (16 M) with my girlfriend (16)have an almost 1-month long relationship, and I've got quite a problem missing her...

POST: Well, it's not like this is going to be a long story or anything, it's just that I'm having quite some problems missing my lovely girlfriend. Our relationship started in the beginning of this April, in that time we've both had a week of vacation where we didn't see each other (we did text though, so no worries there ;) ). And now she's going to England for another 8/9 days, and this really is very hard for me. Mostly because I just want to be able to physically be with her... 

It's not as if I don't want her to have a good time in England or anything, it's just that I really don't want to not see her for more than a week. And I just don't really know how to deal with this emotion.

Additionally, I'm pretty concerned about the potential consequences not seeing each other enough in the first weeks could have for the rest of the relationship.

And, just in case you were wondering, I really love her and I'm not planning on leaving her anytime soon :)

TITLE: Medical bill was in collections for two years, found out about it last month and paid half off, now my parents are telling me not to pay anymore until they contact the insurance company we had because it should have been covered.

POST: Okay so, in January 2012, I ended up in the ER two days in a row while my entire family was at Disney World. Fast forward a few months, I recall the bill coming to my parents' house, and receiving it when I came home from college at some point. My parents have never been very good with money. Countless months with our water, power, phones shut off. Last year, the bank took our house. It wouldn't be far fetched to imagine a situation in which my parents conveniently misplaced this bill.

Being the naive 19 year old that I was at the time, I assumed my parents would take care of it. As I've come to learn being a much more responsible and **slightly** less naive 22 year old, my parents let the two medical bills (totaling $1700) go to collections. I found this out when I checked my credit for the first time (suggested by a finance professor) around the beginning of last month.

I talked to the collection agency, which is based in the city that I live in, and as suggested by my own mother I set up a payment plan. I have already paid ~$700 of this debt. As of yesterday, I get a call from my mother who urges me not to pay any more money because I had insurance at the time and it should have been covered. Now, my father is attempting to contact his former employer to process an old bill.

My question is: If by some miracle this does happen to work out, what is the likelihood that I would be able to get the money back that I have already paid?

Oh and, like an idiot, I was intimidated when they already had all of my information, and gave them authorization to withdraw the money from my account.

POST: Ok, so this didn't actually happen today but it still haunts me. I feel it's worthy of a TIFU.

Me, my then girlfriend and two friends were on holiday together in Spain. We went to a Water Park one day and we were queuing to get it. We paid at the entrance gate and walked in...

I walk through the entrance and into this big open space, where you can go off in various directions to wherever you want. I was at the front of our small group. I stopped to look around, wait for the others and decide where we should go

Suddenly, I felt someone pulling at my right arm, so naturally I look to my right and see a Water Park staff member with a camera. She was saying something in Spanish and indicating towards me the universal 'photo' hand gesture with her free hand.

""Ah, she wants my picture, to capture my enjoyment at this fine establishment""

I turn to face her and strike a semi-comedic pose with a big grin...

She doesn't take a photo. ""No no no"" she says, whilst pointing behind me. I turn around and realise that I am stood directly between the photographer and 2 young children stood with someone in a giant penguin suit...

Friends laughing hysterically, I walk away, with my pride well and truly bruised.

One hiccup though and I don't know how to approach it without sounding like a dick. We both work full time. I own my house and she practically lives with me. She's a teacher and I travel for work sometimes and do very physical labor. We are both salary. Sometimes I'm gone for a week or longer and work 80+ hours a week. Sometimes I don't have to travel and work in town. 

Almost every single day when she comes home and I'm in town, she always complains about how tired she is and practically acts like she is the hardest working person in the world (I'm not exaggerating that). I always ask if she needs anything, offer to make dinner, get her a glass of wine ect. She never shakes off work and let's herself separate from work. This is the part where I sound like a prick...

TITLE: I (21F) am really worried about my roommate, who has OCD (19M)

POST: Hi guys, I'm a huge fan of this subreddit and I'm hoping you'll have some advice.

I (21F) currently live with my boyfriend (21M), his brother (19M), and a mutual friend (25M). 

My boyfriend's brother (R) and I are pretty close. We're very similar and have kind of bonded over all kinds of things. I'm also very tight with the rest of my boyfriend's family. We have been dating for over four years.

Before R moved in with us, my boyfriend and I were concerned that his OCD was flaring up again. He has had OCD since he was 11 or so, and has gone through periods of doing really well, and doing really poorly. We both talked to him about it and said that we weren't sure that he was ready to move out and encouraged him to get professional help to ease the transition from living with his parents to living on his own.

Well, he didn't do anything, and now I think he's getting worse. He washes his hands multiple times an hour, and he completely freaks out if we touch of any of his things. He has an aversion to my boyfriend's computer, that he has now gotten rid of, and now he's refusing to touch anything that might have touched the computer. 

He is extremely childlike and is constantly asking us for reassurance about EVERY LITTLE THING. I am starting to lose my cool, to be honest. It's extremely exhausting and I don't know how to deal with it anymore. I don't know if I'm enabling his OCD or exacerbating it with every little action, and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells all the time. I don't know what to do to help him. I'd really appreciate any advice. 

He will NOT seek professional help. We're working on that. Specifically, I'm looking for things that my boyfriend and I should or can do to help him out. I don't want to enable his behaviours but I don't want to upset him or make things worse, either.

TL;DR:", My boyfriend's brother and I are very close and have a lot of things in common. We both have OCD and have talked about it.

(◕‿◕✿) She told me she had fun even though it was kind of stressful (she's very timid and shy and my friends are very loud/outspoken). She's very comfortable around me so I was just talking to her the entire time. There are approximately three weeks of school left and she goes back home after finals week (she's not from here). And there is a small chance I'll be able to see her during the summer.

TITLE: Apologizing to an ex...

POST: I dated a guy for about 13 or 14 months a little under a year ago (we were 21 and 22 at the time); I broke up with him February of this year. Since then, I have undergone massive personal change, to the point that I almost feel like a completely different person than who I was when I dated him. 

The relationship was very emotional right off the bat, as I was only a month out of a nearly 5 year long abusive relationship. He remains the nicest guy I have met to date, and he helped me and supported me as I went through dealing with my issues left over from the abusive relationship. I was his first real, long term girlfriend. We ended up living together that summer, and also spent three and a half months traveling through Australia with his friend and his friend's sister. During our relationship we talked about children and marriage, and I found myself thinking about looking at rings and him proposing.

I made a lot of promises to him that I shouldn't have, because throughout the entire relationship I always knew in the back of my mind it wouldn't be forever. He would voice his fear that I would leave him during or after our trip to Australia, and I, without hesitation, promised him I wouldn't. I know I absolutely devastated him when I ended the relationship.

Now, in my new place in life, I feel like I owe him an apology. I know I used him as a very drawn-out rebound, reveling in the security and love he provided. I feel like I should own up to the pain I caused him, and I want to wish him well. 

Is this a good idea? Should I let sleeping dogs lie? He and his best friend (our travel buddy) only recently deleted me from facebook - up until November we still retained that modicum of contact. Since finding out he deleted me, I've found myself thinking often of the hurt I caused him, and I legitimately hope he is happy now. I have no idea what kind of person he is now and I haven't seen him since the break up, so I don't know how any contact from me would be received.

Previously: 

**Recap**

""Zoe"" [27F] is smart, successful, and kind. I should've confessed feelings for her long ago. I'm simultaneously more confident around her because she's a trusted friend, and less confident because she inspires me so much personally and professionally that I'd consider it a huge loss to lose her. But I missed my chance and then distanced myself from her for two months because we both have extremely busy careers I didn't want to get in the way of.

Last week after reconnecting with her, I asked her out, but she wanted to bring another guy. At Reddit's encouragement, I asked her directly if she was single. Her response was that she is, and that the guy is just an acquaintance, but she stopped responding after that so I thought she wasn't interested, and that I had lost a valued friend.

Today she reconnected, and is asking me out. Tonight. No mention of some other guy. I'm very confused. How to approach this with minimal awkwardness?

The bigger things, like HIV and Hep, he says he tests less frequently, but we live in one of the world's safest countries, there were only 122 new cases of HIV among sexually active men in 2012 (most recent statistics - gay or straight - yeah, I checked), and socialized medicine and strict rules makes it almost impossible not to be alerted within a relatively short timeframe after having had sex with someone who was positive.   
 
**I know this.**  
I also know how condoms work. However, I don't trust them. I think they'll break, or that something bad will happen somehow. I lube up, I (or he) puts them on the right way, we take every precaution - but I don't dare letting him finish. I have to tell him to quit, and then I finish him with a handjob or something.

POST: I usually dye my hair dark reddish brown, but thought I'd like a change. And being in college still, there's no better time to experiment with cool hair colors.

I bought a box of hair bleach, and another of red dye and went to work in my apartment bathroom. After a while of sitting around waiting for the dye to take, I got in the shower to rinse it out. 

There was a lot of it in my hair, so when i stepped into the shower, the bright red dye started rinsing out and pooling in the bottom of the shower, which doesn't drain well. And of course, some dripped into my eye, causing me to flail around, splattering dye all over the shower tiles and sliding glass door as I looked for a towel. 

Just as I was dabbing my eye with the wet corner of the towel, my boyfriend (He lives with me) came home and came into the bathroom. 

He saw the red splattered glass door, and me in the shower, and screamed. I, startled by hearing him scream since I hadn't even heard him come into the bathroom, yelped too. I jumped back and stumbled to the ground in the shower, and he pulled the door open, freaking out. 

He saw me fallen down in several inches of blood red water, with more red splats all over the wall, and that was when I realized how scary it must have looked. 

I quickly said that it was just hairdye, and we ended up laughing about it.

Then I went NC again for another 14 days until this weekend when I broke it again. The conversation was pretty much the same, that she is still in love with me but is enjoying being alone, and reconnecting with her old friends. And that she needs more time.

TITLE: Me [20M] with my two [30ish F] friends. Unsure how to feel after incident

POST: Just wanted to know if what I'm feeling is right. Basically there are two women I'll call one Cara and the other Steph. I arranged to have a dinner with Steph (she is an awesome cook), Cara was the driving force since they haven't seen each other in a while. This was 2 weeks ago. A few other people were invited, Cara asked Steph to make her favorite dish.

Day of the dinner, Cara doesn't show. We were hanging out earlier but needed to do other things so we went our separate ways (3 hrs before the dinner). She didn't answer any calls or texts. Steph was upset but she said it was fine (probably isn't but I'm talking her through it).

I was worried and called and next day (it was close to 24hrs since I last heard from her) and her friend picked up saying they're out bike riding. He puts Cara on the phone and she said she was sick and she currently doesn't have her phone on her. 

I've talked with Steph and Cara hasn't called or texted, nothing. I'm a bit upset. I honestly didn't think Cara would act this way, and frankly I'm disappointed. We hang out more often than Steph due to distance, but now I feel like she is just being rude. Cara is feeling a bit of tension from me since I've barely responded to her or talked to her (I help her with business for free when I have free time).

Should I tell Cara my opinions? 
- That I think it was quite rude to stand people up 
- Not contact anyone involved at the dinner for over 22hrs (only being reached by someone contacting her) causing us to worry
- Being ""sick"" with no phone but still well enough to go out? (I call bull but purely speculation)

TITLE: What have been your worst moments of impotent rage?

POST: First, this morning I'm at my dentist, and I'm told that my insurance isn't going to cover the installation of an implant I'm getting, because I switched jobs (and therefore insurance providers) between the time they removed the broken tooth and put in the implant base, and now when they need to put the actual cap in. That makes it a pre-existing condition so far as they're concerned, so it's not covered. 

Then I go to my bank to try to understand why not one, but two of my credit cards were declined at dinner on Monday. Their explanation ""Well, sir, you haven't used your credit card since October, so it was flagged as possibly stolen, then you go to spend $480 on dinner, so we assumed it was fraud and deactivated your cards."" to which I responded ""So you're telling me that first you thought my card was stolen, but you didn't tell me about it, then you thought it was being used fraudulently so you deactivated both of my cards, but didn't bother to call me to say 'Hey, we think something is fishy'?"" 

So yeah,

Every year for homecoming our school paints windows for clubs, after school activities, sports etc. My friends and I thought it would be funny to put a me gusta face on the boys sport page and a f7u12 face on theirs (like they're frustrated by us copying their design, which we did, and such).

Here's the thing. One of the girls didn't think it was funny, and I was called into the office. They see it as me saying ""Fuck you"" to the girls team, and saying ""I like"" to the boys team. Hence, that we're better than the girls. That is TOTALLY not what I was aiming for.

POST: My boyfriend [19M] and I [18F] have been having serious talks about moving in together recently, starting our futures together, etc. But one thing is keeping me from wanting to pursue this relationship any further. 

Over the weekend I discovered that he has an Instagram account where he follows over 30 regular looking, younger girls with pictures of them on beach trips, posing with friends, and just average pictures of their lives. When I asked him if he knew any of these girls in real life or anything, my boyfriend said no, he uses them as material to masturbate to. 

This is incredibly weird to me, and I've told him before that I'm uncomfortable with him looking at these images of other women instead of me. He argued that these girls are ""sluts"" and are posting these pictures because they want guys online to look at them. I disagree. These are younger girls who are just posting a beach picture here and there. They are not ""sluts"" by any means I don't think. 

My boyfriend said he would delete the Instagram account since it made me so uncomfortable and I began crying when he made the above argument. Is it even worth it making him delete the account? I've been so creeped out ever since discovering it and am rethinking everything.

TL;DR:"," My boyfriend looks at innocent pictures of girls on Instagram instead of me when we have talked about moving in together, and I'm rethinking my position on it.

POST: I met my girlfriend during the first day of high school around this time four years ago. We became best friends and eventually started dating. We've been a couple for a little bit more than a year now.

I'm a really shy guy. I don't have a really outgoing personality and I can enjoy my time alone. My girlfriend is very outgoing and she's already gone to a ton of parties and she's only been in college for 2 weeks. She plans on joining a sorority and everything.

Over the course of her first two weeks in college, she's told me that she's turned away 3 guys already and has gotten drunk several times. But last night, she told that she accidentally kissed a guy while she was drunk on Sunday night.

I try not to think too much about it since she said it was an accident, but the thought that I'm not the best for her keeps coming to mind. She has guys coming to her and she's always out and about while I don't really like crowds or flirt much. I've been thinking that maybe I'm holding her back from finding someone that's more like her and has more in common with her. I still love her, but maybe I'm not the best guy for her.

TITLE: [29/f] Has anyone divorced/separated and continued to live with your ex [m33]? (xpost-divorce)

POST: I am telling my husband tonight that I want a divorce. We have two children together (8 & 6). He knows this is coming, so I don't think this will be ugly, just upsetting.

Unfortunately, we can not afford two separate apartments, so we will continue to live together for a while. He's already moved into a separate bedroom. I plan to continue to share all the finances/bills until we work out two separate budgets. I know he won't have a problem with this.

Hopefully, it will continue to be amicable, and he will agree with what I want in regards to our living arrangement/relationship/family. Here are the things I want to discuss with him in regards to all that:

Live together, but in separate rooms

Pay bills together, as we always have done, until we get a separate budget put together.

Keep things as normal as possible for the boys for as long as possible (obviously, we will discuss our separation with them, but I mean to keep them in the same school/neighborhood/etc)

No sex (or seeing each other naked). Also, I doubt this will happen any time soon, but if one of us starts to date, no bringing anyone home.

Make childcare decision together

No blaming each other. What's done is done, and we need to move forward for the sake of our children.

When all our debt is payed off (should be by February), we will sell our house and look for separate homes/apartments and legally divorce.

I know this isn't the best option out there, but we simply can't afford two separate places right now. Has anyone been in this situation before? Any tips or advice for making this work?

However, a few months ago I was promoted to supervisor, too. I was happy because it meant more money for us to accomplish our goals. I thought he was happy as well.

TITLE: My boyfriend (M17) constantly talks about how attractive other girls are, and really messes up my (F17) self esteem.

POST: We've been dating for fourteen months. My boyfriend has always been very honest with me about everything, which is one of the things I first loved about him. If I asked him a question, he'd give an honest answer, no matter what. My problem with this started about six months ago, when he told me that he liked another girl for the first month of our relationship, and the only reason they aren't dating is because she turned him down twice. It broke my heart. But he's started being honest about things that I really don't want to know the answer to, or question I haven't asked, such as telling me how hot another girl is, or how she has an awesome chest or ass, or along the same lines. Like, I get it. They're all very attractive. He'll always send me links from porn that he finds really attractive.

But the problem lies in the fact that I have absolutely terrible self image, and with good reason. I have little to no curves, and a bit of extra chub on my stomach. I'm not fat by any means, but definitely not skinny. And every single girl he likes, or thinks is attractive, has a massive chest with a huge butt and is perfectly skinny. Think Victoria Secret model. And if they aren't curvy, they're short and cute and skinny and blonde, which is the exact opposite from me.

The real kicker came yesterday, when he decided it would be a good idea to tell me he's in love with a fictional character. I freaked out, probably a bit more than I should, but I'm just so tired of it. Once we started fighting over this, he started trying to eat his words, saying that he just meant that she's ""fun to play with"". He had been talking about how she's so cute and perfect and attractive with awesome cleavage for ten minutes before, which is just suppose to traslate into ""fun to play with"". I don't know what to do. I love him so much, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm a second choice behind all these other girls. What can I do? I'm can't feel so worthless for much longer.

Of course I was shocked, hurt, angry, ect but we were married at this point and he was very ashamed so we talked about it and I decided to just try and handle it. I let him know that his trust card had been revoked and it would take a lot of work and time to get it back. well here we are now, he has been working at this place for 2 years and recently told me of a woman that works in the pffice upstairs for weeks her name kept coming up and I even gave him a book to give to her on a subject we are both interested in. Yesterday he confessed they were attracted to one another and that he felt bad because she flirted with him and he let her and he flirted back. He told he had been working up the courage to tell me for a couple weeks now and he tells me he will tell her today he can no longer be aroumd her or talk to her because of their attraction. Problem solved? 

I told him I was happy he told me and did not freak out on him because I want him to tell me these things in the future but my self esteem has always suffered and now it is even more crushed. I do not know what to think or feel or how to get over his past cheating and become a confident person. I feel lost.. Help?

TL;DR:", in very early stages of relationship my husband confessed attraction to coworker and has been working at work for 2 years and flirted back. I do not know how to handle this loss of confidence and how to become confident in my personal life., my husband with a history of cheating is attracted to another coworker and my self esteem is nonexisisent at this point,5.46875,-3.431640625,128,-0.488525390625,128,lose

TITLE: Neighbor drove into my patio and his insurance is not helping.

POST: This has been an ordeal for months now and is getting to the point where I may need to get a lawyer involved.

My neighbor drove into my patio door and damaged the patio door, some of the carpeting inside, patio furniture and a large planter. This was a hit and run as the neighbor then left and did not report this. One of my other neighbors noticed damage on his vehicle later that evening and we called the police to come take a look at the vehicle. When questioned, the neighbor with a damaged car admitted fault to the police officer.

His car insurance company is not the greatest, and is only offering a resolution of the actual value of the items and not the replacement value. Therefor, the amount of money they are offering is less than what it would even take to repair the sliding patio door. Side note: when I do email or call, it can take 4 days to get s response via email and I have yet to receive a phone call back even when I have requested it.

Our home owners insurance company is able to put a claim in, but then we would have the issue of our rates going up if we do that.

Can we file a law suit against our neighbor or our neighbors insurance company? Is there anything that can be done with the insurance company to even maybe just push them to give us the replacement value at all? We reside in Illinois.

TITLE: My [18 M] girlfriend [19 F] of over 1 year often feels alone when I'm gone. How do I help?

POST: My girlfriend is often lonely when I'm not around and it doesn't help that she doesn't have any close friends anymore. She's the kind of person to latch onto one close friend, but unfortunately she doesn't have those friends anymore (most of them weren't great people so she grew out of those relationships).The problem is that I am the one she latches on to and I'm not always around. She wants friends of her own to be able to hang out with when I'm busy or with my friends and she also wants to get into some hobbies again. This all sounds pretty good, but she's pretty terrified of people—especially girls—and she's overly critical of her abilities, leading to her quitting out of intimidation.

How can I encourage her to pursue these things or what kinds of advice can I give? I've been really working on not blaming recently and I feel like saying ""you need to do this"", ""you need to do that"", blah blah, might make her feel less motivated. She used to really be into writing and I told her I'd write some stuff with her (even though I'm trash). This, she said, will give her some confidence in her writing again. My worry is that she'll just end up relying on this so when I'm not around she won't find joy in it anymore.

TITLE: Is my [23F] boyfriend [23M] of 3 years overreacting? I texted him a flirty uberfact which led him to ask if I wanted to be a porn star.

POST: I know this sounds really silly, I just think it was unnecessary for him to ask me if I wanted to do porn. This is how the convo went:

I texted him the uberfact screenshot: The average female porn star is a 5'5"" brunette woman who weighs 117 lbs and has B-cup breasts. 

(I sent this to him because we had great sex the night before and was trying to be flirty since it matched my height,weight, etc.)
   
BF: what are you saying? you're a porn star or wanna be one?

me: (laughing emoji) I thought it was funny

BF: I assume that's a yes
BF:?
BF: be honest would you want to be one?

me: are you f-ing kidding me? I was just trying to be funny and then you got all serious about it. 

BF: no, I just wanna know. I won't get mad

me: no, I don't want to be a f-ing porn star.

It goes on and I basically told him that I felt it was unnecessary to ask me that. He went on to blame my hormones and called me names such as crazy and dramatic. He said I was trying to take the question to another level but that's what I feel he was doing from the beginning by even asking me that. Am I overacting? or is he? I feel that I got defensive right away because we have been going through a rough patch and just recently got back together. He refuses to apologize because he feels he did nothing wrong. I was just trying to be flirty with him and never thought he would take it so seriously.

TITLE: Why do men not back down after a girl states she is not interested?

POST: Last night I was at the bar shooting pool, a Latin American man in his late-forties or early-fifties complimented me on a shot I had made by shaking my hand and giving me a kiss on the cheek. As a new pool player, and a few drinks deep, I deemed this to be a kind gesture, said thank you and continued on with my game.

Later in the evening he approached me while I was waiting for the single bathroom to open up. He tried kissing me, I nicely told him I was not interested and in order to avoid what was turning into an awkward situation, held a conversation until the bathroom door opened up. After I left the bathroom, he was still in the hallway, called me beautiful, and I said something along the lines of ""That's sweet.  Have a good night"" and went back to meet up with my friends. 

Over the course of the night, there were 3 more interactions with this man similar to the one outside the bathroom. After the last time I decided to leave the bar since he was not getting the hint and was making me extremely uncomfortable. 

I can't explain how many times this happens to me. I'm a relatively attractive girl in my early 20s and am not a ""bitch."" In other words, I don't like rudely telling a guy I'm not interested, nor do I feel like I should have to. I feel like it should be sufficient for me state that I'm not interested politely and that be it. 

so I'd really like to know why men tend to do this to women?? and is possible for me to turn down a guy nicely and not have the reoccurring, borderline harassing, attempts to be ""picked up""?

POST: This was actually in 1986.  Ancient history.   Anyway, I was browsing a thrift store and came across a beat up vinyl copy of ""The Who:  Live at Leeds"".   It looked like a generic album cover, and inside it were a few pictures of the band, a rejection letter from EMI, and, to my shock, a copy of their contract to play at Woodstock!

Mother Lode!

I quietly paid fifty cents and contemplated my newly found riches!   This thing must be worth thousands, I thought!

The fuck up is that I showed the album to a die-hard fan and she immediately offered her car for the album.   It was maybe a $2,000 car.  I knew better and rejected the trade.

I held on to the album for twelve more years, figuring it would only go up in value.   In 1998 I emailed a record dealer about my treasure and eagerly awaited his multi-thousand dollar offer...

""All the albums came like that.  Sorry.""

A further gut punch is that there were actually items missing from the album, making it just about worthless.

TITLE: I[30M] have been dating an amazing [30F] for 6 weeks. Everything was going great but then...

POST: Dear reddit,

I like this girl a lot! She is smart, honest, beautiful. Our relationship was going so well on multiple levels and we both openly discussed possibility to take it one step further. Both of us are 30 and we have very successful careers. For the first time in my life I started feeling like she could be the one. It was wonderful! But then she told me the painful truth...

She used to date her boss for couple of months and they eventually broke up to avoid harming the company. I think he is the one who didn't want to make their relationship public and that triggered the breakup. Since they broke up, they've been working closely together, they hangout frequently as friends and sometime go on business trips together.

I am generally not a jealous guy, and I feel like I could live comfortably with something like that but it turns out that her affection for him is still there. He is a good looking guy with a great sense of humor and they actually seem to get along pretty well. On the other hand, she obviously likes me a lot and wants to be with me. So what is my problem then?

When I told her I feel a little uncomfortable with the fact that their romantic relationship has not completely ended and that I worry that at some point they might hook up again... she did not deny it. She even confirmed that there is a very small chance that might happen in the future.

Today I feel more depressed and miserable than I felt in a very long time (I am generally a happy guy). I am in a complex conflict with my emotions and reason. I know I like her even more because of her openness and honesty but I know this situation will make me very insecure or even jealous in the future and that is something I don't need in my life. I feel like I should break up and at the same time I am afraid that I am letting something really wonderful slip out of my hands.

Please advise,

TITLE: TIFU by falling asleep in my bros bed

POST: Alright, so this happened two days ago, on saturday afternoon. To set the scene, I go to a pretty large school in the south and the weekends pretty consist of drinking a lot and socializing. I got to the house where a few of my bros live at around 4 and to kill the time we decided to through a movie on and chill until it was time to start drinking and go out. HBO recently started carrying Bulletproof Monk so we throw that on. Turns out its fucking awful. I end up falling asleep on the end of his bed laying ~~horizontally~~ like a dog.

     Falling asleep was the beginning of my fuck up. I briefly remember a nightmare of being chased by some hellacious creature, I turn back to look at it while running, but cannot find it. I look forward. BANG I hit something.

     So I come to stumbling up the stairs of my bud's house with a massive headache, not knowing what the fuck has happened to me. I  rub my head (much to my chagrin it feels like its been beaten worse Denver in the super bowl last year) and find my hand covered in blood. I basically fall into the living room where all my friends are drinking and ask what the hell is going on and what happened. I simply can't talk and am concussed as fuck. I walk into the bathroom to find a major gash at the top of my head and blood all down my face. The next thirty minutes is comprised of me being in complete shock, not knowing where I am, and wondering what happened to me. I finally gather myself and start cutting up with my friends. This is when the guy who's room I fell asleep in walks through the front door holding a golf club... Not pointing fingers, but seriously, i'm suspicious now. 

**TIFU** by falling asleep on a bed doggy style, having my best friend hit me in the head with his golf club and being majorly concussed.

POST: Not using a throwaway because who gives a fuck

A while ago my (ex)gf of around 7 months cheated on me.

 Now, I understand that I need to get over it, and I pretty much have, my problem is trusting my now girlfriend, lets just call her S, because she goes to a different school around 30 min away from me, and lives that far away too. She has a ""party"" background, while I on the other hand don't.

However, she says the partying days are pretty much done, but I suspect that is because she goes to an online school, but that will change at the beginning of next year when she'll go back to a real high school because it looks better to graduate from.

Like today she, without telling me, went to a ""pool party"" as she put it, that consisted of her, 2 of her friends (both girls, and 4 guys. That made me extremely unsettled. Am I over reacting, or am I justified in being unsettled by this? I feel weak and insecure when I keep telling myself that I shouldn't be. Any advice on how to get over this?

TITLE: My[17/F] boyfriend [16 M] broke up with me but we're still kind of ""together""

POST: So my ex and I were in a long-short-distance relationship which was causing a lot of pressure on our relationship. We got very serious way too quick and that led to some arguments about trust (whether I can trust his promises about the future). This is his first relationship, which I think makes the whole thing even more stressful for him. He said that when he's with me, we feel like forever and that's why our relationship seems stressful because he's never been with anyone else before. Also, our relationship has the whole world against it--we go to different schools, and I'm at boarding school, so that exacerbates the problem. I see him once a week.

So we came up with some sort of post-break-up blob arrangement--not defined at all, right? We kiss and cuddle and have sex, he still calls me baby and tells me he still loves me, and the arrangement is all in all very confusing. Moreover, I can't reconcile the idea of him kissing another girl and then kissing me. I understand his point, I support him in his exploration (kind of) but I feel like if he wants to know what life is like without me, we shouldn't be acting like we're still in a relationship. He can't have his cake and eat it too, right? 

I really love him. We love each other, no doubt. I know that we're young but we've both sacrificed so much for this relationship--I applied to my second choice college instead of my first choice Early Decision (which is binding) just for him. And yes, I did settle a little bit, but the school I applied to is still incredibly rigorous and a great school in general; he's planning on going to a nearby university. Being without him will be so, so hard and I want nothing more than to be with him but I feel like I'm not actually with him in this arrangement we've come up with.

I guess my final question is: which approach should I take to get him back as soon as possible? Should I go along with our weird blob of a relationship (despite my doubts), or should I cut him off (at least romantically) so he can realise what he's missing?

I am a freshman at what is considered a ""prestigious"" American university. Let me just start off saying it has been a wonderful experience academically. None of my classes are larger than 100 people, which provides the support I like to have from my professors. That being said, the social scene has not been treating me well. I have not been making any ""real"" friends and the party/drinking scene here is just not for me. I suppose that might be due in part to the fact that my longterm SO and I are attending school together. Actually, its more like we attend our entire lives together. All of our friends are mutual, our holidays consist of both our families, and we pretty much do most things in unison. I also have been connected to some very influential people because of my SO's family. I have begun to realize that while I have only been here a short time, I am at a major crossroads. Part of me wants to start living my own life but the other part of me says I should simply put up with whatever in order to reach my aspirations (which I might add, are very high for an average 19 y/o).

I work at this place full time where as she works just on weekends, since she attends college during the week. It's a retail job, so weekends are very busy.

I am able to talk to her in short amounts of time during the days she actually does work, but don't feel that it really amounts to much more than just chit chat.

Over the times that we have talked, she seems to be a very sweet and energetic person, someone I'd like to get to know more. I feel that just outright asking for her number is weird since we talk for only a few minutes a day if she does work. I'd like to be able to talk to her more and get to know more about who she is. After that, eventually see if she's got some interest in me, and then go from there.

POST: My older brother and I are in our late twenties and are only two years apart. This afternoon we got into a physical altercation in front of family and strangers.
We were coming back from a family trip to Cancun and our seats were separated on our way back. I was sitting in the back and my mother, father, sis-in-law and brother were up towards the front. When the plane landed, they went directly to customs without letting me know. I got off the plane and couldn't find them. I waited around since my phone was dead, assuming they went to the bathroom. Eventually I ran to customs to find them in line. After sprinting to them I asked them why they left without letting me know. My brother got upset with this question and began calling me names in front of our mother and a line full of strangers, calling me immature, stupid and a p*ssy for thinking this way and not going straight to customs. I tried to explain to him why I brought it up, but he shoved me and continued arguing. Eventually I straightened up (I work out and box on a regular basis, while he is more of the sit at home activity/video gamer type) and told him it was not okay to do that. He proceeded to continue arguing and told me to ""f---- off"" and that he was ""done with me and never to call him again"". I was incredibly hurt by his words, but still upset that he would not respect my boundaries.  I'm still up, hours later, wondering if this is a normal thing that happens or if I need to apologize. Please help and be blunt, I respect my older brother and consider him one of my best friends and have never sworn or raised my hand in anger to him. I care about him and his new family (he is recently married to a wonderful woman).

TITLE: Should my BF [26/M] have stood up for me [25/F] against his friends?

POST: Back story: My bf (26/M) and I (25/F) have been together off and on for almost two years now. The reason for the break was because I left to go teach for a year abroad and to kind of find myself. I'm back now and we got back together. 

**UPDATED BACKSTORY** - The break up wasn't me breaking up with him to go abroad. We had talked about me going, staying together for the process, and having him come over on a visa for the last two months to stay with me. Three months into my journey **HE** dumped **ME**. Not the other way around. This was a job opportunity trip that helped me in my field of profession. I didn't cheat on him nor did I talk/sleep with someone after the break up. I focused on my job.

Last night while out with my guy (26/M) at a bar we ran into some of his old coworkers. After some chatting the coworkers realized that I was the girl who left the country. They proceed to tell my BF, in front of me, that he should dump me, asked him why he was with me, told him I was a bitch and that I'll probably leave again. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was when one of them stated ""Well, at least she lost some weight while she was gone."" 

My guy, though definitely uncomfortable with the situation, failed to say anything or stick up for me. I was left trying to change the conversation onto anything else that I could. They were drunk so I can look past the remarks but I can't seem to shake the fact that my guy didn't say anything to them to try and make them stop. He did apologize for their remarks afterwards but the damage was done. I'm not looking for him to fight my battles but I was very disappointed in how he handled the situation. Should he have stood up for me or should that be something I should do for myself when it comes to his friends and coworkers?

TITLE: My (30/m) girlfriend (31/f) snooped through my email and is moving out

POST: So my girlfriend asked me for the password to my computer. There isn't one, and I told her as much. 

Apparently after she got done shopping, she got into my email and searched herself. She found some older gchats from a few months ago where I had talked to a couple of old friends about some fights we had. I didn't say anything derogatory, just explained what happened. These people live nowhere near us and are not in our current shared social circle, and very close to me and not judgmental, so I thought it would be ok to get things off my chest. I also had an email exchange from a while back when we had broken up and (subsequently) gotten back together with my mother, who was just saying it sounds like we just got in a fight, she really likes her, and if we get back together, she'd be happy.

This very much angered her, and she claims she can never look at those people without feeling shame. Right now she's apartment hunting.

I guess my main question here is if I did anything that terrible. I understand her embarrassment, but it wasn't anything bad, just arguments, that I was talking about. And she's flat out told me she's complained to her friends about me. Friends we used to see often.

The other thing is that it took a bit of effort for her to find those. Even just searching her name, she had to go through a few hundred messages to find anything incriminating. It feels very violating, honestly.

Thanks for reading. I'd like honest feedback so I don't repeat the same mistakes. I don't know if the relationship is salvageable though.

TITLE: TIFU by whining about a cancer patient. Repeatedly

POST: TIFU in a small, day ruining way. 
My first FU was about three months ago. A beat-up, rusty van parked in my apartment parking lot hadn't moved in weeks if not months. The license plate was expired as of December 2012 so I took a picture and emailed my landlord. I thought perhaps someone had abandoned it (looking back, they probably wouldn't have left the license plate on it, but whatever). She said the van belongs to my neighbor who is undergoing chemotherapy. That's why the van hadn't moved in forever. Apparently the 2014 license renewal sticker had simply fallen off. I felt like a big jerk for tattling on someone who is ill. Within the next week the van had moved parking spots twice so I felt guilty that this poor sick woman might be moving her van just because I had complained. I've seen my neighbor since and she's always been friendly to me. However she referred to herself as ""a big pain in the butt"" so I was a little worried my landlord had told her who had reported her van.
Today's FU began when I was coming up the stairs from the basement, having put laundry into the washer. I ran into this neighbor and we began chitchatting. I mentioned that I had just had to completely clean out one of the washers because some terribly rude person washed a bunch of Kleenexes and left the washer completely disgusting. I practically had to climb into it to pull some of the tissue out of the drum. Shortly after this the conversation ended and I went back to my apartment. 30 minutes later when I went to move my clothes to the dryer the same neighbor was taking hers out of the dryer. She must've had the Kleenex in her laundry. Now I feel horrible for having complained right at her. Even if she wasn't sick I would have felt bad calling her a rude jerk right to her face, but she is on oxygen and everything and probably wasn't able to clean the washer out herself. I'd like to apologize to her but I'm not sure whether that would make it more awkward.

TITLE: Personal ledger vs. online banking -- why actually keeping track of your expenses matters

POST: I know that keeping track of your expenses is a no brainer...  everyone knows they should be doing that.  But, I wanted to offer a warning to people who are relying on the balance reported by their bank, particularly financial responsibility noobs who have tight budgets.

I have been banking online almost exclusively for several years.  When I first started out, I thought it would be the most convenient, hassle-free, error-free way to keep track of spending... after all, it's all right there for me to see, anytime I'm online.  But, I noticed quickly that my mental balance was different than the balance shown on my account.  Why?  Because purchases don't necessarily happen in real time with real amounts.  Various merchants will sometimes authorize a smaller amount before actually charging the full amount.  Consider the case where I spend $60 to fill my car with gas.  Three days later, the $60 has still not left my account.  There is, however, a $1 authorization charge, which will change later.  If I just go by the balance reported by my bank, I will think that I have more money than I actually have.  This happens also anytime you leave a tip.  **Note that it almost never goes the opposite direction.  You will almost never have more money in your account than is being reported by your bank.  This is a systematic error.**

For me, at any given time, I would say that my reported balance is about $100 *more* than the money I actually have.  If you're running a tight ship like I am, that's a large margin of error.

TL;DR:"," I keep track of my personal spending by banking online almost exclusively with my bank.

TITLE: How do you fit social drinking into a healthy lifestyle?

POST: Hi Loseit!

This subreddit has helped me make some drastic changes to my lifestyle, but there's one thing that I have a constant struggle with that I need a little advice on. I tend to eat around 1200-1300 calories per day and exercise daily (cario + weight training). My goal is less numbers-based and more about feeling healthy and getting in shape, as I am already at a healthy weight for my height. In contrast, my SO (in the ""obese"" range at 6'1"" and 235lbs, used to be 180lbs freshman year, but gained all the weight after he joined a fraternity due to the drinking culture) constantly says that he wants to lose weight, but so far he has only been making minimal effort by means of eating a little better and going to the gym a couple times a week with me. 

We're both in college and in Greek life, so something that's central to our social lives is drinking. During this past semester, I've been mostly sober, but it's getting harder and harder to tell my friends why I'm not drinking because they don't take me seriously. On top of this, my SO feels like we should drink with our friends since it's our last semester and begs me to drink with him, but he rarely stays within a reasonable number of drinks, often averaging 7-8 beers or mixed drinks in a night. 

Does anyone have experience dealing with situations like this? What can I do to get my SO to stop binge drinking and ruining the minimal progress he makes each week? And how do I help him to see that making changes to our lifestyle is the best way to lose weight? Any tips or advice would be great because I've been stressed out about this for weeks!

TITLE: How can anyone be for the death penalty when trials (based on a jury) are never going to be fair and bring real justice?

POST: I watch lots of crime dramas and read lots of the news, so maybe my understanding is skewed, but as far as I know: A jury is selected, these are people from the public called forward to do jury duty. A lot of these people don't want to be there, they want to go back to doing their jobs or looking after their family, so that would bring me to the conclusion they don't necessarily care that much (of course some people take it seriously, but it only takes 1 not to...).

So how can this be fair? How can a jury of ""normal"" people who don't necessarily have any interested in being there and people who could be easily swayed by charisma be given the responsibility of deciding if someone is guilty?

Let's not forget how lawyers are different, a poor person could get a really shit lawyer who knows very little of what they do and represent the person poorly, or a rich person could get the best lawyer around. If both were charged with the same crime and the evidence was flaky, you can be pretty sure the rich guy will get off and the poor guy will be convicted, because representation matters a great deal. 

How can people who agree with the Death Penalty think this is right? I would never really agree that the death penalty is *good* or *right*, but I could understand it **if** it was possible to be 100% sure of someone's guilt.

Gf just admitted to me that she had sex with a random guy while drunk after a party. She is *very* ashamed/ regretful and is afraid that I will dump her (she admits that if I had have done that to her she would have dumped me).

SALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!

was my Freshman writing seminar instructor may her name be cursed for a thousand generations. The topic was ""great new books."" Being an open-minded starry-eyed freshman, I thought this would mean ""fiction."" Nope. Poetry. Shit. 

So Sally always insisted that all of our analytical essays were full of cultural stereotypes. This was really difficult to avoid and got on everyone's nerves, particularly because all the poetry we were reading was really heavy stuff and had to do with race, inequality, poverty, etc. It felt like we couldn't even mention race without being ""insensitive."" Fast forward to the final paper.

Sally has a friend who is an impoverished poet, and Sally assigns us her book (called ""a vertical interrogation of strangers"") to read. The book is basically a collection of poetry based on the author's interviews with anonymous Indian women regarding their (often abusive) relationships to men. I choose to write about this book for the final paper. I have had enough of Sally and her lectures on ""stereotypes"" at this point. In fact, I am so tired of her that I become convinced that her friend's book is a giant cultural stereotype. I think you can get where this is going...

TITLE: I can't stand my girlfriend's mum.

POST: So my girlfriend's mum has anxiety (pretty bad from what I know), however, she's also still a responsible parent for 3 children. She abuses my girlfriend by saying things such as ""you're the worst thing to happen to me in the world"" and abuses her for moving away with me. If my girlfriend disagrees with her on anything she then gets verbally abusive again. 

Now, me and my girlfriend of 4 years live together, and have been relatively happy, but my girlfriend gets incredibly upset at me whenever I get angry about something her mum does. For example, her mother recently suggested just ""dumping"" her 3 children to go live with a love interest in another country. 

Most recently, her mother was staying in our apartment and was supposed to leave at a designated time in order to arrive for a plane. I stayed home from university (because I don't feel comfortable leaving someone alone in my house and my girlfriend was at work) so I could make sure the house was locked up when I left. However, her mum constantly complained she was going to miss her flight (I assured her if she left soon she most certainly would not), to which she rung her boyfriend, made herself a coffee and sat down for a chat, whilst still complaining she was going to miss the flight. She didn't leave for another 2 hours and prevented me from leaving. 

I vented about this to my girlfriend to which I was told I was ""being a f***head"" about. I'm considering removing myself from this altogether, as in breaking up and moving out as she can't understand my anger towards her mother or tolerate it at any stage and I don't feel it's my place to force someone to cut off their mother.

Basicly, we broke up because I was an idiot. We dated last year when I was 18 and started socializing for the first time and man.. I was a complete idiot to people. I never had any interaction with a friend group and I found myself as a part of this big cosplay society, I had tons of friends, a nice girlfriend, really cool people to hangout with and then.. I became a real jackass, a real idiot. My girlfriend broke up with me, my friends stopped talking with me and everyone started to hate me, I was talking shit about them for no reason, acting like an idiot. After like 6 months, I improved myself massively, I am friends again with everyone once more, even better than before, I am the guy people talks when they have questions about many things ranging from comics books to science. I am now a better and more civilized person.

And now, I want my girlfriend back, I dated a lot of girls after her but never been happy with any of them like I was with my first girlfriend. Now that I am a better person, I think I can have her back. But I don't know if I really want her back. I was happy with her but that doesn't mean I was never sad. She is an artist but not the most talented one, she can't draw very well even though she has art training. But she blamed ME when she couldn't enter an art school, just because I called her at 10 to wish her luck and turns out she went bed early and said ""You woke me up so I couldn't sleep, that's why I failed."" and that really broke my heart. But in time, she became a better person just like I did. She is hard working, drawing better, doing lots of stuff.

I can win her back I guess, but I am still not sure, I am also planning to study hard and leave this country to live in a better one.

I did not know at the time that I would become so close to him and that I would lose my virginity to him. The lies have become so deep that it has become incredibly difficult to tell him the truth.

What should I do? 

I can see myself with him long term. Perhaps even longer. I can keep this to myself, as I can tell him that I do not want to talk about past relationships but I feel afraid that if he ever found out he would be devastated.

So a little backstory, I'm 17 and I have a handicapped placard because back in July I broke part of my spine in a weird, stair-related accident. I'm perfectly okay now, but walking long distances still hurts. I generally try to park without using the placard, but if there are no spaces or the only spaces available are really far away, I'll park in a handicapped spot. 

Now, I live in a town KNOWN for having almost nothing but old people and beaches- it's basically a retirement community. A lot of the old people have handicapped cards just for being old. I tend to get a lot of glares when I walk out of my car after parking with the placard up because I appear fine. 

Today, I went to the grocery store and was looking for a spot to park when I noticed someone had parked across two handicapped spots and a crosswalk. I was in more pain with my back than usual, and this really pissed me off. 
So I did what any logical human would do. 
I parked a few spaces down, went to the cart return, and absolutely surrounded their car with at least 20 empty carts.

TITLE: Hit a wall, or fell off a cliff, during my marathon training

POST: I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. 

Two weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. 

These are all my guesses: 

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. 

2. Change of bed? 
3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. 
4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. 
5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. 

Any thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?

I live in the suburbs of Chicago, right outside the city limit. My city is pretty nice, but there are some iffy surrounding areas. My girlfriend and I rented out a condo from the owner last May and it's been great so far, aside from a couple incidents that got me thinking.

In early August, I bought a Nexus 7, worth about $300 bucks with shipping and had it delivered to the condo. The UPS guy dropped it off in the foyer. It was swiped by the time my girlfriend got home, two hours later. I talked with the woman who signed for it and concluded that she received a package at the same time (verified) and the UPS guy applied her signature to my package. She told me that stolen packages are pretty common in this complex. Called UPS, they're still working it out, but my credit card company has already refunded me my money. Lesson learned.

Right after that, the labels on our mailbox were ripped off. They were flimsy cellophane taped on, so I thought maybe they just fell off. We got a label maker and put them on again. Ripped off again within two days, though whoever did it obviously struggled with the one on the buzzer, half of it is still attached. I don't know what purpose this would have, but there you have it.

Third incident was last night. I do karate Monday and Wednesday nights, and my girlfriend went to bed around 9pm. I get home around 940 and in a half asleep daze, she tells me she was hearing strange noises. Apparently after she went to bed she heard someone rattling the doorknob, loud enough for the cat to jump up and run towards the door (she's a energetic cat though). I fall asleep and figure she was just half-asleep. 


TL;DR:"," bought a cheap used nexus 7 with shipping, swiped labels from mailbox, later found out someone ripped off labels, called UPS, credit card company has already refunded me money. Should I be worried? What are my options?"," Worried someone may be casing my girlfriend and I's rented condo.

TITLE: [Help] Dog is over ""Ideal weight"" but ribs are still visible?

POST: We rescued a Staffordshire Bull Terrier from a shelter ~6 months ago, when we got her she had a broken leg and was visibly skinny. 6 Months later she has put a lot of weight on and is a very energetic young dog (she is approx. 11 months old now) however, while searching online i find the ideal weight for bitches of her breed is 10~16kg, she weighs 16.5kg and her ribs are still *just* visible when you look at her. She gets fed 454g of raw minced beef  per day and a handful of ""WainWrights"" dog kibble (not a cheap brand, but certainly not the best) per meal (2 meals per day), she also gets small portions of veg and gravy once a week when we have our Sunday roast dinner. Should i be able to make out the lines of her rib-cage when she is stood, I have been assuming this means she is still slightly underweight? I often vigorously play tug with her and she has become noticeably stronger since we got her and I believe it looks like she has packed on a lot of muscle which could account for the weight gain i guess?

TITLE: My boyfriend [24] and I [22] are having issues about cleaning.

POST: We have been together 2 years and living together a little less than 1 year.

The main issue we are having about the cleaning is that I have higher standards than he does. However, I feel like what I am asking from him is more than fair and he should be able to make a few small changes to his behavior.

When we moved in together, I told him I would take care of the actual cleaning (dusting, vaccuuming, laundry etc.) as long as he would maintain throughout the week and not make messes that had to be picked up first when its time to clean. I made this agreement because of my previously mentioned higher standards and because I tend to like things being done ""my way"". Plus he usually works on saturday and I get bored anyways.

 Basically my expectations are that he put dirty clothes in the basket, throw away his trash instead of leaving it on the table, wipe up spills, and help out if I ask... I feel like this is pretty basic stuff, especially since he is home more often than I am. It takes me longer to clean if I have to round up dirty socks from every corner and throw away a weeks worth of soda cans first. It makes me feel taken for granted, unappreciated, and occasionally like the dreaded ""replacement mom""

I've discussed this with him before and he says he doesn't really care how clean our place is, doesn't think about it, and he's just a messy person and this is how he is. That last part about him just being messy is the thing that really pisses me off because I think I have asked for very reasonable things and it makes it sound like he's unwilling to change. To his credit he has gotten a little better (last apartment he had was a disaster) but there's still room for improvement and thats all I'm asking for.

So /r/relationships my questions are 1. I think I'm being reasonable, am I? 2. How can we work together to solve this? Yesterday when we argued again I suggested doing a daily pick up before bed, what else can we do?

TL;DR:"," We have been together 2 years living together and have different standards for cleaning.

TITLE: I[18/M] might be the problem in the relationship with my lover.[21/M]

POST: For some background: I grew up emotionally deprived, and didn't really start to understand that I was that way until my first relationship with a girl that turned abusive on both ends. I have a problem with empathy, and I am not easily emotionally moved by other people's emotions nor do I care autonomously about anyone.

I like to believe I'm a good person. I don't hurt anyone or anything on purpose, I usually at least pretend to be sympathetic when people talk to me about their problems, but I've noticed I can't really do this with my boyfriend.

I can't comfortably get close to him, emotionally, physically, or otherwise without feeling great levels of anxiety. When he was over at my house a few weeks ago and after he went to sleep, I had a good four hours of being awake brooding about how ridiculously bad at this I am, and I came to the conclusion that I just might not be dating material.

I've known him for four years now, and we've been dating for eight months. In this eight months I grew distant pretty fast and I'm nowhere near as open with him as I used to be. My sexuality isn't a problem(I've had two sexual relationships prior to him and know for a fact I do indeed enjoy the male body), I think it's my romantic orientation. I might be aromantic, and I don't know how to approach this topic or even if I should. I don't feel intensely about anyone, not even him. I've been able to be incredibly close with other people who weren't romantically involved with me, even to the point I had a friend with benefits and I could share a bed with someone. I can't do any of that with him.

TITLE: TIFU by answering honestly to my little brother

POST: My little brother is 8 years old. I have always taught him to ask me any questions and that I'd promise to always answer to the best of my ability with no consequent.

So there we were, shopping in the mall when he randomly asked me ""What does prostituted mean?"". I was taken aback since I know what type of books and videos he watches, so I wouldn't expect him to hear this word. But nonetheless, I begin to explain to him what 'prostituted' and 'prostitution' mean.

I start to explain to him that people really love sex and what'sex' actually is. I continue to expound that some people love sex a lot but don't have girlfriends/boyfriends/SO/etc to have sex with. Therefore, there are people who offer themselves in return for money or other favors for sex in return. And therefore, they're prostituting themselves.

He has a dumbfounded look on his face after... He then asked me Why would people be ""prostituted"" to the fullest extent of the law for stealing then. I then notice the sign across from us stating 'you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for theft'.

I lose my cool here. I yell at my brother ""YOU LITTLE SHIET, ITS PROSECUTED, NOT PROSTITUTED. LEARN TO READ DIPSHEIT!""

POST: The problem is: 

He has trust issues. He says he trusts me, but that he doesn't trust the guys around me. And although he trusts I won't cheat on him, his qualm is that I like any type of attention I can get from guys. I'm around more people more than he is because I'm still in college and yes, I do get attention from college aged guys at work, school, social media etc. 

He's particularly jealous of a co worker in his 20s who happens to be really fit and my math buddy whom I study with sometimes. Last week, when I studied with my math buddy he kept asking me several questions about our hang out and I became annoyed to the point at which I told him that if he didn't trust me he was going to ruin the relationship. 

I also told him I had looked up articles and was starting to wonder if this was a red flag trait of a toxic relationship. He then told me he wanted to trust me and he wanted to work on his trust issues and to be supportive of him. I did reassure him and say I wouldn't trade him for any of these guys because he is special to me. He does however, admit he has these trust issues and is willing to work on it.

TITLE: Finally ended college studies, what should I do now? Look for work or keep studying?

POST: Hi all, first time posting here... I recently ended studying but honestly I feel like I don't know much, even if I have the best grade in the generation of the engineering school where I studied.

I studied Software Engineering, and I have an interest in Artificial Intelligence. I could, with my current knowledge, look for work to do stuff like development of applications like management, mobile apps, accounting, etc. A bunch of boring stuff...

Or I could keep studying to aim for a bigger goal, I have a strong interest in AI, NASA, AEM, but I feel not smart enough to search for that. I don't know anybody in the field, and I'm not from the US.

I'm 25 years old, living with my fiance. If I keep studying, I can try to get a scholarship but it's not guaranteed to get one, and the school I want to go is in another state of my country, so I'll have heavy expences if I go that way, and my fiance just have highschool finished, so he won't get a very good job.

My fear is that if I get a job right now, I'll be there more time than I want (settlement, conform), and I'll be condemned to a cubicule for the rest of my life, doing boring stuff (it's really not easy to get a good job here).

And if I study, maybe I won't be able to pay the whole thing, and at the end maybe studying AI won't help me at all, and I won't be able to get a job with that, at least not in this country.

So here I am, not deciding on what to do. I have until march to decide to actually keep studying. What would you do? There's points in favor of each thing, and I'm confused. :) Thank you in advance.

TITLE: My [22/F] boyfriend [21/M] of 5.5 years packed up his stuff and left without much warning.

POST: My boyfriend of 5.5 years decided that he needed to leave me with little to no warning. I arrived home to him with all of his stuff packed. It's been 3 days and I have not heard a word from him.

A little back story. We started dating when we were 16 and since then have been head over heals for each other. We moved away from home together about a year ago so that I could finish my 4 year degree. He moved with me to support me financially and the agreement was as soon as I graduated,  spring of 2015, I would support him through school. We've been through a lot together and I supported him much of our relationship because his dad was sick and didn't have a job. All of a sudden after almost a year of living here he decides,  he can no longer support me because it is too much for him and he feels I am holding him back. 

I forfeited going to 4 year school for him and stayed home and went to Community College FOR HIM, I supported him emotionally and financially for 4 years and he can't handle one more year of taking care of me?? I am completely heartbroken. Of course things between us weren't perfect but I never thought they were so bad he would just up and leave me high and dry. I was pretty blindsided. Now I will more than likely have to move out of my apartment and I have no idea how I'm going to make it through the rest of the summer let alone the rest of the year. 

I am still in love with him but he crushed my heart when he was already out the door.

TITLE: Should I file my taxes myself?

POST: I know you guys must be sick of giving tax advice, but here is another question.  I want to know if I should pay someone to do my taxes, like H & R Block, or use the H & R Block online software, like I have done for the last two years.  It costs about $60, I think to file them using their software and I think it is around $150 - $200 or so to get it done at an actual H & R store.  

I am a single mother, so I will be claiming head of household with one dependent, I have had two jobs this years, so I have two W2's, and I have to claim unemployment-and I had no taxes taken out of the unemployment.  I also have day care expenses to claim.  I also moved this year, but not more than fifty miles or for work (I know that matters with taxes).

Last year, when I filed myself using the online software, my circumstances were pretty much the same (except no moving), so it isn't difficult for me to file them myself.  I just haven't gotten back a lot of money, which is fine, in a way, because I set up my taxes so I won't get a big return at the end of the year-because why give the government a free loan and all that. 

So, do you think I should pay someone to file them for me (I wonder if I could somehow get a larger return), or is it not worth it and I am better off doing them on my own.  

I'd like to add I am not stuck on H & R Block, I have just used them in the past.

Thank you for your time.

POST: I met this girl in a bar and had a one night stand. Ever since we've been inseparable however lately I have felt bored/uncertain about what she is after/what I am after. 

She's gone away for 2 weeks and I havent missed her, in fact the only feeling I have had has been that anxious feeling you get in your tummy. She is a bit of a party girl and has been to a festival and did't call for a few nights. I don't think she did anything I just feel weird about it. 

She is 27 and I am 23. Surely the difference means something. It doesn't feel like it does (she is a young 27 and I am an old 23) but I can't help but think it kind of does. 

She lives with two guys who she is super close with an in many ways are platonic boyfriends. They are both pretty into drugs, she has mentioned how she likes cocaine and whilst I have tried it I would never a) pay for it or b) risk getting caught in Aus with it. 

There are other issues around sex and stuff however just reading this post has made me think the decision is pretty clear. I think I don't want to break up because she is a good person, very hot and she actually likes me (I am honestly amazed?!@). 

I guess my real question is do I risk never finding a pretty girl who will fall for me again or do I just settle for semi happiness (mostly derived from the lack of unhappiness).

TITLE: Hey reddit, tell me your stories of being unfairly disciplined. I'll start:

POST: I used to go camping with my family every summer in S. Ontario in a small campground where most people knew each other, year after year. As the people of my age group grew older we began camping on our own, in separate parts of the campground from our parents (this would typically be from 19 years old and onward). So naturally, as any people of that age do, we drank (legal age in Canada is 19) and smoked weed and held awesome parties way on the other side of the campground to avoid annoying the other campers. Now my last year of camping at this lake we had a nice party one night lots of people some familiar faces, some new. The next day the administrator of the campground informs my site mates and I that we are banned from the campground for 5 years for giving alcohol to minors. What really happened is irresponsible parents lost track of where their kids were, and also track of where their booze were (the 15 and 16 year olds, who were not invited, obviously stole their parents alcohol). I know I didn't give any alcohol to any of the young people, and I'm sure my friends wouldn't have (we worked our asses off at near minimum wage that summer just to save up enough to go camping, we had no extra drinks.) We appealed the decision, but in a closed door meeting, the board of directors upheld the decision. sigh, it was a good time while it lasted.

We would sing songs, make crafts, play games... stuff like that. At the end of class, there would be a one on one quiz with each child. I would try to get them to say a couple words and they would get a treat. All very fun and engaging and all in English.

My fuckup occurred one day during the quiz. I was sitting on the floor with the child, a little girl, and her mom. She was very young... too young to really get anything from the class. 

Sometimes if the kid wasn't into it, I'd play small games to focus their attention. This particular time, I decided to try something that my dad always used to do with my siblings and me: he'd kinda pinch our nose between the knuckles of his middle and index fingers. Then he'd show us his thumb between the knuckles and say, ""I've got your nose!"" It was supposed to look like he pinched the nose off our face. I don't know if I'm explaining it clearly or not... but it was silly and we'd laugh and that was it.

So I do this to this little girl (who can't really even speak Korean yet, let alone attempt what I'm asking her to do in English). The mom gives me a horrified look. Something is obviously wrong so I hand over the treat and mom scoops up baby and off they go.

After, I explain to my Korean co-teacher what happened and she cracks up. Apparently that hand gesture, the fist with the thumb poking between the index and middle fingers, is the Korean equivalent to flipping the bird. Chalk another one up to cultural misunderstanding!

TL;DR:", teach a playgroup of very young children in class one day the fuckup of poking the index and middle fingers between the knuckles of my middle and index fingers during a one on one quiz. What do?, I didn't know the Korean version of the middle finger and unwittingly busted it out on a young girl in an English class.,8.75,-2.53515625,128,0.03875732421875,128,lose

TITLE: Talking and being with my girlfriend [19F] feels completely vapid and almost like I'm [17M] interacting with a machine, however it gets a bit more complex. What do?

POST: Right, so I've been with this girl for a bit over two months now; she's attractive, we share the same general interests and I should be loving her to pieces. The catch? I'm not, honestly this whole thing feels completely vapid, every time we kiss or even just talk I don't feel like I'm getting any satisfaction, and that I may as well be talking to an inanimate object. Her replies to things are rarely longer than a few words, and even sex felt rather dull when we got round to it.

So yeah, I took heed of this and decided to tell her that it wasn't working, she cried a bit, and we generally left on good terms, it all felt pretty decent. Then I did a really piss-poor thing and decided to get back with her. Why? Because I felt bad, and I won't deny that this whole thing is anybody else's fuck up than mine.

Now to the actual question: What do? Going in and simply breaking up with her again would look ridiculous, and would most certainly put us on bad terms with each other for the foreseeable future, considering that we have a few close mutual friends, that would also cause complications. I need some advice here, if any can be given.

TITLE: Bad kisser or no chemistry? [20F] [21M]

We have been on a couple of dates in addition to hanging out as friends, and I really enjoy spending time with him. The problem is that he's great in when we're just hanging out, but if things start to get romantic he gets incredibly awkward and nervous and it just turns me off. When we've kissed I felt no sparks. If anything I just really want to break it off. 

I am very inexperienced with dating/relationships. I had never even kissed anybody before him. So, at first I chalked the bad kissing up to awkwardness on my part. After doing it a couple of other times though, my feelings haven't really changed. I'm starting to think I just don't have chemistry with him. What makes it complicated is that I do feel physically attracted to him, but when we kiss it just goes away. Could he just be a bad kisser?

I don't want to lead him on if it turns out we don't have chemistry, but I also want to give this a chance because I like him. Any advice?

TITLE: My [28F] girlfriend[28F] of 2 years found out her sister's boyfriend is cheating on her, she wants to tell her. What do?

POST: Long story short, my girlfriend is the eldest in her family. Mama Bear through and through. Three younger siblings, Kay (21F), Jay(19M), and Bee(17F). Recently,  she came into the knowledge that Bee had been seen in bed with Kay's boyfriend(21M) while Kay was at work.

Long story long, Brother comes down to visit recently and walks into the family home where Kay, the boyfriend, and Bee still live. He's looking around and walks past Bee's open door where he sees two people clearly having sex under the blankets. Figures Bee has a guy over and goes into the kitchen for a while looking for others in the house. Turns out there are only two people in the whole house. No other cars.
He then realizes that it was Bee and Kay's boyfriend in the bed together. He confronts Bee saying what she's doing is messed up. She says she has no idea what he's even talking about. 
He lets it go because there is family trip planned and all the siblings are going north to visit family together. And pulling all this drama out right before the trip would be a seriously terrible idea. So he tells their Dad about it after the trip is over. And my girlfriend's dad tells her about it. She immediately calls Jay to verify and get details. 

Details are verified. This is bad. 

She wants to tell Kay or find a way to get them to break up. I don't want Kay to be with someone who cheats on her but I know that if my girlfriend tells her then the relationship between all the siblings is going to suffer greatly.

But the boyfriend lives in that house with both sisters. This could have happened a bunch of times or just the once. There is no real proof and everything is circumstantial.

So neither of us know what to do now. Any advice?

I have blocked his calls and text messages. He sent me letters in the mail. He emailed me 30-40 times in 24 hours and seemed so down that I relented replied, saying I would ""consider talking to him"" ie over the phone. Then he immediately started planning to meet. Now he is talking about buying an engagement ring, quitting his job and moving with me to another country, etc. He has taken to calling me from different numbers and I think he is hiding his caller ID. I am looking for a job at the moment so really would like to answer any calls from unknown numbers but am afraid to.

I have since only sent him terse emails saying explicitly that it is over. I did send him one longer, rant-y email in which I listed the various ways in which he has lied to me to convey the magnitude of his crime. 

I am worried that I am dealing with an obsessive person here who is becoming unhinged. I want to end this ASAP and move on with my life. I am somewhat afraid of him physically because he lives nearby, although to be fair he has never raised a hand at me before.

I have built enough courage to ask Reddit for some advice. 

About 9 years ago a young girl was confused and thought it would be therapeutic to tell our college that I assaulted and raped her. There was a shooting in our school a few month back and I guess they just expelled me with no trial or appeal.

I wasn't the best student (I had aspergers and was going through a lot) and really going through a lot. I shouldn't have been in school but the whole thing through my life even deeper. 

After years I re approached the school (about 2 years ago) and brought a mountain of evidence to clear my name. They kicked me out of the school and refused to speak to me or give me my appeal.

During this time I approached the accuser and she openly admitted to going through some stuff and lying to them. I have this confession as a recording. 

I feel I have enough proof/evidence to sue either the women or the school but I am too 'weak' and 'battle worn' to really do anything about it.

According to her, by taking advantage of the MEC I will enjoy tax deferred growth, tax free distribution, competitive returns, high contributions, collateral opportunities, no loss provisions, guaranteed loan options,  unstructured loan payments, liquidity, use and control. 

Basically I would use it as a personal bank over time and take liens against it to purchase a home, pay off my loans, etc. Sounds great right? Only problem is everything else I have found says this is bad advice if I ever plan to use the money before I die. I'm looking for a second opinion...any thoughts on this? Any alternative ideas to start growing my wealth?

She has also advised me to pay the minimum amount on my student loans for as long as I can. This is hard to do because my interest exceeds my payments right now and my principal is growing by about $700/month. Feeling pretty uncertain and any advice would help.  Thanks!

POST: Okay, like I said I am overthinking things. Normally I do not even think, I just act, but this is the first girl I ACTUALLY like. We had our first date, and I did not kiss her goodbye. I wanted it to be more of a surprise, and not expected. She has visited me every day at work since then, and I have kissed her goodnight.

Our second date is today, and I want to be more prominent with my flirtiness. The first date was getting to know her, and ever since then she was at my work. I want to kiss her immediately when I see her, and since I have kissed her goodnight the past 5 days, I dont really see anything wrong with it.

I just do not want to move this too fast, and I am worried that doing that will.

POST: So I'm new to reddit so please be kind! My boyfriend suggested I ask for help here.

Background - about a year ago I was in a bad car accident (rear ended a semi on the freeway doing 60mph because he cut me off). Well I'm paying monthly to multiple places, hospitals & doctors, for the exams and tests I had done.

I went to the dentist for my checkup and was told that I need a root canal and crown but my insurance covers almost nothing - I would still need to pay $1200+ out of pocket. I cannot afford this on my income currently.

I have a credit card that I use for small purchases and pay off every month, would it be a smart idea to get another credit card with lower interest rate put my dental work on it and then pay it off monthly?

Or is there a better solution I'm missing? I have tried care credit and they won't approve me :(

POST: I'm in need of some advice! Disclaimer though, I know not everyone agrees with casual sex, but all that matters is that I am and that I am safe about it. Please no judging on that aspect :)

This last weekend while out I ended up meeting a guy and we found out we had some mutual connections,we danced, hit it off (both were drinking though) and I walked home with him to his place. He got my number before we went to his place.

Obviously, we hooked up and he said a lot of ""sweet"" things (like constantly mentioning that he loved what was happening and that he really liked me a lot - I know that can't be entirely true though as we only had just met). After we were done, he kept mentioning that sex with me was the best and I said that I should probably go home as I didn't want to overstay, but he told me not to worry and to spend the night.

In the morning, he kept on cuddling up to me while we were both awake and we kind of just lingered in bed for about an hour because we both weren't feeling 100%. I was going to walk home, but he insisted on driving me, so I let him. There was just small talk in the car about plans for the day (what we were each doing) and about how we both didn't even plan on going out the night before.
Before I got out of the car, he double checked to make sure he got my number.

My question I guess is - do you usually hear from guys like this again? I guess because of the cuddling in the morning, and some comments he made during the night and then the checking to make sure he got my number are throwing me off a bit. I know this very well could be a one night stand, but what do you think from a listeners POV? It's only been almost three days since I last saw him.

TITLE: My [23M] girlfriend [22F] of 4 years became a born again virgin

POST: Hey guys

I'm an agnostic atheist and my girlfriend is a Protestant Christian. We've been together nearly 4 years. I am going to be attending grad school and she is in undergraduate school. We have lived together for a year and we're pretty boring people. We're both introverts and have had maybe two fights through the duration of our relationship. I'm flexible and she's flexible. There has been no cheating or jealousy feuds. Sex maybe once per 1.5 weeks on average. You can said we are 'content' or 'happy.' We're best friends.

Around Christmas time last year a member of her close family died and she's really starting to develop her relationship with God. I've noticed her becoming more distant and I suspected it's because she's re-evaluating what she wants in a partner and in life. We've had a talk before about Christianity. She wants a Christian husband with Christian values (all of which are the same of mine; I was raised Catholic/Protestant). It's important for her partner to be Christian because it has something to do with purity of marriage and how that helps you build a closer relationship to God. She wants to better serve God in any way she can. I respect her views and her motives. I went to church with her last weekend.

About two weeks ago when I was kissing her before bed she said that she doesn't want to have sex out of marriage anymore and that doing it makes her feel guilty. I'm flexible, but this one is definitely a curve-ball. We've talked about marriage and agree that we're far too young, and want to wait until we are 28-29 years old to get married. 6 Years is a long time without sex. She's okay with that wait. Sex is important to me because I believe that it creates and shows love and also it's fun. I just don't believe you have to get married to do it. 

It might be easy for you to type ""just break up,"" but if you haven't built something for 4 years, it's a little more difficult to understand why this isn't easy especially because we're good friends in good standing.

Anyone have any insight?

TITLE: I am a [22M] cant tell if [21F] whom i've been texting and chatting with for 2-3 weeks is interested or not

POST: I ran into a girl i met a couple years back in 1st year of university. Only had a couple conversations with her back then so we weren't too close. We take the same train to work so we often end up chatting on the morning rides there and sometimes the way back. Usually fun conversations, a few somewhat awkward silences here and there.

From what I've gathered, shes a sweet nice girl and super close with her family. We've also texted back and forth and I've gotten some good responses. Though I'm not sure if it's just her personality and if she's like that with her other male friends.

I think she cares what I think of her, she checks her reflection on the train window and adjusts her hair when she thinks I'm looking away. But thats probably just a girl thing?

Also once she texted something slightly negative about someone she knew (whom I dont even know) and afterwards she immediately texted, ""i sound ungrateful right now! im not usually like that, k?"" 

So last night I finally texted her at like 9pm asking if she wanted to grab a drink at this bar thats pretty close to where we live. She replied saying she couldnt tonight cuz she was in the middle of doing photo editting for a friend and her mom just made food for her. I said ""no biggie, another time then"" She followed up saying ""yea let's go next time"" with a smiley face. 

Can't tell if it's just an excuse. My buddy told me that if a girl doesnt specifically suggest another day it's a terrible sign and she probably doesn't rly want to go. I think there might still be hope but I haven't dated anyone for a year so I'm not very sharp on this kinda thing.

TITLE: Girlfriend [24 F] kissed a close friend of hers and is unhappy with the consequences and is now taking it out on me [24 M]

POST: Hey all,

Some background: my girlfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about a year now, dating for about 3 total. The distance has certainly been tough, and we tend to only see each other every couple months. 

The story:

Within the last year, she had befriended one of her coworkers and they got pretty close. She's gone through a rough patch with some health stuff, etc, and he was basically who she relied on to help, since I couldn't be directly there. Recently though, when she was having a bad night, he came over and they ended up kissing. From what she's said, she immediately cut things off there and had him leave. Since then, he's quit their place of work and many of her coworkers have turned on her saying that she ""led him on"". They don't talk anymore so as far as I can tell, she thought of him as a friend and he thought of her as more than that.

Now, she feels totally alienated and has lost a good friend. I'm honestly not even that upset with the kiss, since she immediately told me about it. What I'm struggling with is that now she seems to be taking her frustrations out on me. Last month when I visited, she was incredibly distant, and still really upset regarding losing a close friend and having work now be a tough environment. She basically avoided any and all physical contact, but has said that she still loves me and that things are ok. I've been as supportive as I possibly can be, and I think very understanding regarding the whole kissing another person situation. But honestly, I'm not sure how to handle this. Should I just continue to be as supportive as possible right now? I really love this girl and I don't want to come off as being needy or selfish. Thanks!

TITLE: TIP my friend by grounding him

POST: The Background:
You read it right, I didn't get him grounded, I actually grounded him. This particular friend has really strict parents, especially when it comes to grades, and they only allow him to have a B in one class, with everything else being A's, or they ground him.
Events Leading to the Prank:
Now, I don't usually pull any pranks, but he knocked a full, heavy water bottle onto my shoeless foot (by accident). I demanded an apology, and when he refused, I vowed to prank this hooligan.
The Setup:
I got another friend to get his phone (he has a really shit slide phone, but that has nothing to do with anything) and give it to me. Then, like a government hacker, I set to work trying to figure out how the fuck that not-smartphone worked. I managed to switch his mother's contact to my name (now you see where this is going) but he got the phone back before I could put my number under his mom's name! This was all going on at the beginning of class, and when class started I didn't know how I would finish the prank. But the April Fool must have smiled upon me, because lo and behold, a fire drill saved the day! Turns out that some other kids had taken his phone since he had gotten it back from me, so I told them I was pranking him, and they gave me the phone to finish my work. I finally finished and the phone was returned to him.
The Execution:
You can probably guess what happened next. As his mom (more like his dictator) I texted him and said that his grade in chemistry had gone down to a B due to a test which he thought he did badly on, and that he could forget about doing anything over spring break. I had him going for a good while, until he got a text from me (actually his mom) telling him he had to pay for his broken retainer and that she would be picking him up soon. I guess he pieced it together then, and when he cursed me out over text, I knew it was over because he would never curse at his supreme leader. Prank successful, imo

TL;DR:"," By changing phone number of friend who got him a prank phone, I grounded him and he never cursed me over text.

Here's the situation for me: I'm 22, living in WA, one quarter away from finishing my AA, and wanting to transfer to the local university here so I can be a teacher. Problem is, my grades are very terrible. 

I did poorly in high school and just barely graduated (by failing a class, no less), and while my grades at the community college have improved, they're by no means good (around ~2.6). I've been rejected from the university about three times now, and I've lost faith in myself to keep going. I've done my practicum at a high school and had my talent/eagerness complimented on, but I'm worried that I'll never get to be a teacher, and I honestly don't know what to do now. I want to work with high schoolers and I love doing it, but I'm not sure if that'll happen if I don't get my act together.

That aside, I'm also a fucking mess myself. I'm not going to measure my amount of self-worth by whether or not I have a girlfriend, or if I've got a car, but I'm a person that lacks motivation in life (although my interests make me motivated).

I've never considered it ethical to try to ""hook up"" with
drunks. I have occasionally considered hookers, but I would
rather be with a girlfriend, someone I had real feelings for.
I'm not even sure I could enjoy it much in either case, without
a fully willing partner, who genuinely wanted me. It's clear
here that some women do think differently, that any sexual
experience is more appealing than none.

She is also (after having done photography for only 6 months) getting paid work, I have yet to have this, and it really is sheer luck but the very first ""collaboration"" we did together she had a model and invited me along (all fine) I said ""hey I know this awesome spot, and I have all this paint, and here is some awesome stuff we could do!"" then she posted all her photos before I did and didnt mention me so everyone thinks I copied her, and it has worked that way for many things to follow and I am just wondering how you people deal with being enraged at someone who you cannot avoid, also I think if I blatantly stop talking to her the rest of the people around us will think I am the one being a bitch, which also bothers me, what do I do?

TITLE: [21m] I have feelings for a girl[24f] thats in another country and dont know if i should pursue her or drown them out

POST: I am a 20 year old guy turning 21 next week she is 24. Ive known her for 2 years now but we were always friends. We were always interested in the same things and even when she moved away we would play video games together to shoot the shit.

She moved away last year to vancouver to pursue her modeling career and we kept in touch. I talk to her 2-4 times a week on skype and we text eachother basically everyday. Recently we started talking about more serious things, previous relationships, sex, what we want in a partner etc. She is an extremely nice girl who has told me things that she says she hasnt told anybody else(most likely b/c talking over the internet is a lot easier than in person). i know with the way things are i cant see her and its stupid for it to be on my mind but for w/e reason she is constantly on my mind and idk if i should tell her anything.

im not sure if she thinks we only friends or if she has a feeling that things are escalating as well but she tells me she has dreams with me in them and i remember feeling an immense amount of jealousy and sadness when she told me she had started dating a guy last fall but they have broken up since then. I get this feeling like she is my dream girl and to pass it up would be stupid of me BUT i know long distance almost never works. so now i dont know if i should bring my feelings up to her or if i should just drown them out.

He recently broke his arm and is stressing about that because it interferes with him being able to work out (which he used to do to keep him in his ""groove"") and do a lot of other things, a lot of things at his apartment are getting broken, he got his car totaled in an accident, one of his family members was suddenly sent to the hospital, etc. I wish I were there by his side, but I'm 300 miles away, and I don't know what I could do to help alleviate his stress. When we talk on the phone, I try my best to be understanding and be a good listening ear so he could at least talk about it and vent, but he's pretty emotionally reserved and doesn't delve into his problems and instead asks me about my day and what I'm going through.

POST: We've been together three years. He has a degree (communications), tried to go back for another (more useful) one and got burnt out. He works a dead end job now, but is happy, which is important to me. But I'm also frustrated because I feel like I have more responsibilities in our relationship. I carry him on my insurance, pay for our car (which I do use more), make our house budget/cleaning chart and am trying to save up for a house for us.

For two years, he told me this job was temporary while he figured out which direction he wanted to go with his career. Last night he sat me down and told me he needed to give me an ultimatum (his words, ""I don't mean it to be one, but it is""). He knows his job isn't what I want him to be doing but he's okay with it. He appreciates that I've been trying to support him figuring it out, but he's going to stop that and just live in the moment....for now. He knows himself and when he figures it out, he'll be passionate and dive in. 

At the time, I was relieved to hear him tell me straight up.....but after a night of sleep and a day to digest everything he said, the full weight is sinking in. This is a deal breaker for me. I respect his reasons (personal happiness is really important) and wish him well (he's a good person), but I've never been in this spot before. All my past relationships ended with fireworks, drama, tears.... this feels very ""we both are in different places."" 

Our lease is up at the end of June. Do I say something now? Wait until a month out? All these feelings just hit me on my lunch break and I'm starting to panic!

I really wanted to meet her during holidays as it was around christmas but she refused to meet me because those are family days for her and she doesn't want that to interfere with me. so I'll make it short and say that I eventually broke up with her because she was not treating me as I wanted to be treated. right now I really regret my decision and for several weeks I can't do anything but think about her and it's driving me crazy. all the good things that happened between us, all the positive experiences just everything came back to me. 

I'm not really a person that talks about feelings face to face so I decided to write her a letter and tell her that I still love her, that I was sorry for my past behaviours and want to be together with her again. I am actually willing to talk with her face to face because obviously a letter is not enough but right now she doesn't even want to talk about talking these things. 

I'm seeing her everyday as we have 50% of our classes at school together and we're not really treating each other very well as ignoring each other or being unfriendly and things like that. 

the thing is she once texted me that she also loves me, that she is also missing me and I thought that if I tell her about my feelings she might want to be together with me again and might be willing to forgive me.

POST: Quick run down of the relationship:

Whirlwind romance and 6 months later Married young (20 and 19 respectively), together for 14 years, 2 kids over the course of it. In the end a number of issues ended the relationship, to begin with my own inadequacies and addictions, but after the separation thinking about it i came to terms that maybe neither of us were overly happy. 3 days after the separation she asked me back, and i refused, saying we had more issues to work through.

For a long time after this i begged and pleaded and did everything i could to get us back together, but she needed to ""evaluate her feelings"", as she for a long time felt nothing towards me. A few weeks ago she requested i cut all non-essential contact (so only discussions about kid arrangements etc were to take place). Since then i have taken steps to survive, removing many itmes around my home that reminded me of ""us"", removing my wedding ring, ive had a sexual experience with someone else (nothing major and no harm done on either side, were both aware of the current situation) and been on my first date in 15 years.

After a recent meet up with my wife, she confessed a number of feelings, such as jealousy, missing me, her heart wants me but her head says its a bad idea etc. The only feelings i'm experiencing are pity for how shes currently doing, and exasperation at how messed around im feeling with her off again-on again contact and physical/mental affection (often not both at the same time).

Is this normal? am i going through a phase where if i tell her i dont feel anything it could change in 2 weeks and by then it will be too late? Or am i finally looking at moving my life on past this relationship?

POST: I have been in this relationship for almost two years. It hasn't been perfect and I believe it's been on a downhill slope for a while. My boyfriend has recently started a new behavior with me where he will intentionally do or say something that he thinks will annoy me or make me mad, and if he gets a reaction out of me, he laughs.

For example, he will invite me out to dinner with his friends, then he won't text me when the time comes for dinner. When I text him asking when dinner will be, he'll say, ""whoops I forgot, we're actually eating now."" Then ten minutes later will say, ""Just kidding, we're leaving in an hour.""

Sometimes, if I excuse myself to return a text when he's around, he sticks his hand onto my screen and moves it around to mess up my text. If I try to pull my phone away, he says, ""I've always wanted to do that: mess up your text just to annoy you.""

The last time I tried to have a conversation with him about where our relationship was headed, he just sat down and started laughing, saying that the conversation was ""funny"" to him. When I asked him why he felt that way, all he could say was ""this is just a funny situation. It's just hilarious. It's just so funny."" Without any further explanation.

TITLE: TIFU by calling my best friend's grandmother a nazi

POST: This FU happened in December of last year, so forgive me, and is possibly one of my worst.

So my very closest friend in the world (let's call him AssHat) loves to troll me. I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall ""My Grandmother went to heaven today."" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.

I type ""Good riddance"" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying ""That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?"" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: ""She was a horrible person and a menace to society"", ""She even ran over my cat and never apologized"", ""I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items."", ""That monster was literally a nazi!"", ""She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.""

I felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.

TITLE: Me [20F] with my boyfriend [27 M] of 1 year, on a break because of his lost desire for sex.

POST: We went a few days without talking at all so I finally ask him what's up. He keeps saying he can't explain it but he's sorry and that the fire is gone from the relationship. We meet up to talk about it in person and he says he lately has no sex drive, asks me why we need to have sex every time we hang out (2-3 times per week usually).

This made me feel really insecure and took my self-esteem down a notch but told him I wanted to fix it. His solution was to keep on doing everything else the same but just take a break from sex to see if that fixes things. I feel that there is an underlying issue with the relationship such as him just losing interest because we've been together for a while. So I suggested a break from seeing each other/talking entirely and see how it feels.

On my end it feels like shit. I want to call him just to talk about our day or to say I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic or desperate to him.

TITLE: I [23 M] like someone [22 F] who is in a relationship, what the heck should I do now?

POST: Good afternoon, everyone. I have a question for you all and I was hoping that I could possibly get some closure and advice on the subject at hand. 

As such, allow me to set the mood. I met ""Sabree"" during my psych class last semester and at that time, I was not looking to date anyone or get into that scene you know? However, once I found out that she works fairly close to my place of employment and naturally, I decided to speak with her just cause. 

Nonetheless, after a period where I jumped back into the dating scene and failed, I saw her working at her job two Sundays ago and made a very difficult decision. And that was to ask her out for some coffee on Friday and get those digits. However, I had to catch myself because of how nervous I would be. 

As such, after a brief period I finished the mission and boom, got the digits! Excellent, right? 

Nevertheless, we started to speak and then on Wednesday the bombshell dropped! Originally, we going to reschedule the ""date"" for a later date and she told me the following word by word, ""Sorry! I would try to make it back from Eastern on Friday but I wanted to visit my boyfriend"" 

Rats, not this again, you know? Nonetheless, she did in fact make it back just in time for us to chill at Starbucks which was her first time there allegedly so I felt pretty cool about that with me stealing a moment away from ole' boy plus giving her the prequel trilogy of Star Wars to watch over so perhaps down the line, I can watch the OT with her. 

Nonetheless, the point of this question is what the heck should I do going forward? Move on which I plan to do as soon as I can lock in on a few potential women to date or should I continue on and plant the seeds with a slow burning method?

TL;DR:", Met someone in class who works at close proximity to my place of employment and we started talking and things progressed from there.

TITLE: Babysitter negligence.. Criminal?

POST: I have two small children, ages 2.5 years (Liam) and 7 months (Emma). I have a big problem. There was a death in my family and I had to travel several hundred miles because of this with very little notice. Long story short, I ended up leaving my kids with my trusted sitter (we'll call her ""Mary"") for the ~48 hours I had to be away. I felt like that was best for them under the circumstances, but it turns out I was very wrong. Shortly after I had picked up my children, I come to find out that Mary had apparently managed to enjoy a date night while my kids were in her care. The only thing I know for a fact is that she left my kids for at least an hour (probably longer). I don't know where she left them. I don't know with whom she left them. I also have no evidence against her, other than the word of a friend and a Facebook post. Additionally, Liam was extremely hungry and thirsty, and they were both incredibly exhausted. I am not exaggerating when I say that I am very concerned that they had not eaten or slept even remotely enough since I dropped them off. 
Obviously, I feel like this is totally unacceptable, if not criminal!! I don't know what to do and I am very upset! I need advice. Is there really nothing that I can do from a legal standpoint? Also, if I spread the word about her negligence, could that hurt me down the road? Defamation or something? I feel strongly that I cannot just let this go! Please note that Mary has watched my kids at least a dozen times, and I've been completely satisfied with their care up until now. Needless to say, I will never consider leaving my kids with her again. I am located in North Carolina, United States. 
Sorry for the novel. If there is a more appropriate sub for this, please let me know if I'm in the wrong place. Thank you guys in advance.

TITLE: NSV - two of them! Yoga and sexy boots - all in the same day :)

POST: I've been wanting to post one of these for so long since it's been a while since I could say I've had a significant SV.  Yesterday I went to a yoga class for the first time in about 3 years and it was great.  I felt strong and honestly I didn't feel like I looked that bad either.  Not great, but not bad.  I wasn't hating myself during the class so that's at least something.  Then by the evening I felt like crap about myself again.  The negative thinking started in and I was telling myself that going to yoga didn't really matter because it wasn't a very hard class and that there was really no point in my trying to look better because I was always going to be fat and ugly.  

In spite of all the bad things I was telling myself last night I decided to go to another yoga class again this morning.  This time it was a hard class.  I struggled through some of the more difficult poses but I still did it and while I certainly wasn't the best in the class, I wasn't struggling the most either.  

Then after the class, because I was feeling pretty good about myself, I decided to go shopping.  While at the store I tried on a pair of knee high leather boots.  AND THEY FIT!  This may not sound like a big deal but in the past when I wanted to buy a pair of tall boots, I couldn't find any that were wide enough in the calf for me.  Believe it or not, this was the first time since just after high school when I was skinny and underweight that I've been able to put on a pair of boots like that.  Unfortunately I couldn't buy them because they were too expensive but who cares, the point is that my fat legs were not the reason I couldn't have them.

TL;DR:", went to a yoga class yesterday and had NSV thinking I was going to look better when in fact I was struggling with negative thinking and was able to put on a pair of boots that fit.  What do I do?  I'm thinking of going back to yoga tomorrow.  Thanks!, I ignored all the bad things I've been thinking about myself and worked out anyway and I guess my legs are not as fucking huge as I thought.,8.9375,-2.091796875,128,-2.6953125,128,wins

TITLE: Me [21F] asked to donate kidney to uncle [47M].

POST: Hey Reddit, throwaway obviously. Now, this is probably boring as there's not much drama but today my uncle came over to buy my spare bikes for his kids (they're in great shape) and he brought it to mine and my mother's attention that his kidneys are at 20% (him and my mother are both diabetics). 

Now, my mother was not a diabetic when I was born and I'm incredibly healthy with a fantastic diet and exercise regimen. I don't drink (I've had maybe 2 small drinks since turning 21 in December; I'm not a fan of the taste of alcohol), smoke, have done no drugs.

So naturally they both turn to me and my mother asks me if I would be willing to go in for tests to see if I'm a kidney match. We also have the same blood type.

I'm honestly just at a loss for words.

I'm not the closest to my uncle but we are still on great terms.

Also some background. My mother is the oldest of three, the middle child (her brother), passed away in 2010 from kidney failure, and the youngest is the one asking for the kidney. Both of the brothers were born with diabetes, my mother didn't get diabetes until she was 34, while pregnant with my sister (but my sister is not a diabetic, she is 17). I'm like the star health child.

So, I naturally would like to say yes but I'm terrified of anesthesia and surgery and have no idea how to come about this. 

If any of you know any one who has donated a kidney or you've donated one yourself, I would love some insight.

TL;DR:"," asked to donate kidney to uncle with diabetes, mother is not a diabetic, we are on good terms. Also have no experience with anesthesia and surgery.

POST: I know this is idiotic. I know that everyone farts and that it's unhealthy to hold them in. But neither of my other girlfriend's used to fart around me. I mean I heard the odd one, now and then, but with my new girlfriend it's every other day.

She doesn't do it to be obnoxious or funny - she says excuse me and acts like its no big deal. And I know, logically, that its not. But it really bothers me. They don't even smell bad, it's not about that. It's just that I don't want to hear them. It honestly makes me feel less attracted to her.

I don't fart that often, but when I need to I go to the bathroom when she's around. Would it be ok to ask her to do the same? I'm assuming my other girlfriends did this too.

I've only been dating my current girlfriend for seven months, so maybe that's why I'm not comfortable with it yet.

POST: Ok so this girl has been my friend for 3 years, and I never really had a crush on her until now. She is a grade behind me and I rarely got to see her after the year we met but we texted nearly every day since then.  We briefly saw each other my sophomore year and we had a lot of fun that week but she moved away for family reasons. 

  During sophomore year I went through a break up with the first person I fell in love with (I say love because I had never experienced the feelings I had for her before or since), and well I found solace in food and really let myself go and I began eating a lot and the habit stuck for a while.  It has been a year and I have recently acknowledged my problem and have made the effort to lose weight. I'm losing weight through diet and exercise and its coming off but slowly. At the moment I am 5'11 and weigh 215 lbs. 

  Now, I developed a crush for this girl after going through another problem with the aforementioned ""first love"".  I vented out my my problem to my friend and we talked stuff through. Something happened after that, our conversations changed and we began texting more often.  I don't know why but I began to like her more and more every day and realized how perfect for me she was. 

  This was all good and she recently told me she is moving back here. The last time she saw me I was smaller both in height and weight, but the fact that i'm fat now concerns me.

I don't have the perfect relationship with my boyfriend, I often feel inadequate and unattractive because of how he treats me and how he still is infatuated with his ex. I don know if I was just trying to feel wanted by hooking up with this guy, but it is no excuse. I got a ride home from a friend and told my boyfriend as soon as I got home- before I even kissed him or hugged him because I didn't want to deceive him as he has done to me when he cheated on me (he lied about it for over a week about what actually happened- it just got worse and worse when the truth came out. I forgave him, obviously) but maybe subconsciously I did this to ""get back at him"". I don't think I did, but I can't imagine why I'd do this to him otherwise.

When I told my boyfriend he said ""it's okay"" and I asked ""are you sure?"" and he said ""of course, baby, I love you, it's fine"". 

I'm both relived and even more guilty because of his reaction. I would be so mad if it was him (even knowing that in my slip up it meant nothing) and I feel like I don't deserve his forgiveness. I was SO hurt when he cheated on me, it almost feels off that he isn't hurt... As in- does he not care as much about the relationship as I do?

POST: We've been dating for 14 months now and we get along great. We spend all our free time together and communicate well...most of the time. However, I have always felt a disconnect between what I expect from a loving relationship and what I actually have. 

I expect to hear ""I love you"" regularly and other such words of endearment and appreciation. I don't usually hear them. I say them often and get them in return, but he won't ever say them on his own. It really bothers me. 

When I bring it up he makes sure to tell me that he does love me, and that he'll make an effort to tell me more, but then he doesn't. He has told me how important I am to him, how much I mean to him, and how he wants to work towards a future together. But these are only things he says if I bring it up. And never any other time. Ever.  

Add on top of that, that I want the relationship to move much faster than he does. I want to move in together and make plans together and he's not quite there. I really don't push him. He has to feel it at his own pace. But I am starting to get the feeling that (although he may care very much) he might not be in love with me. 

My feelings on it are this.. I can hardly contain how much I love him. I want him to know it and feel it and hear it. I want to plan and talk about our plans (not obsessively but comfortably). Why doesn't he want the same for me? Is it a sign that he doesn't or that we show it differently?  Maybe our styles of giving love are just too different.

He finally says that I should go. I've worked the last 13 consecutive days, and Have a day off tomorrow. I jump at the opportunity.

He calls all my friends at the table. When they refuse to answer, he calls the bar. I'm so embarrassed... I finally check my phone that I've been reluctant to look at and there's mean texts and a threat to leave the house with my son at home. 

When I arrive there was no conversation. He knows that I'm not into confrontation until the following day. It's important to react rationally, not emotionally. 

A part of me knows I went to the game despite him. At that moment, I felt entitled. It's just a Wednesday! I spent every day taking care of my son and the man child.

 I never really ask him for favors like watching my son. Maybe this is why...

POST: I am a college student in a very small Institute. (Graduation class of less than 50) Well there is this particular guy who is the biggest jerk of the school. He has to ""one up"" everybody and is constantly demeaning and disrespectful. 

Well, this particular discussion began over the recent tragedy involving Robin Williams death.

He had mentioned the incident and said that those who take their own lives are ""Shameless Cowards"" and those people shouldn't waste time on Earth if they can't handle life. Also the families and loved ones of those individuals should be ashamed and embarrassed.

I then was very upset and told him that I have had people very close to me take their own lives, and You can imagine what that person must have been dealing with. He proceeded to say they were simply weak. At this point I went off and can't remember everything that was said. Well a nosey student went and told a director that I was Verbally assaulting an innocent student. (of course) this student was an underclassmen who did not know the situation nor the history of this person. They also lied and exaggerated the story.

I was called into a meeting where I was suspended for the next 3 days. Upon my return on Monday I have a meeting with the program Director to discuss further repercussions, aka Expulsion from a College I have paid to go to. 

This college is a joke. The teachers act like high school students and gossip like no teenage I've ever met. the favoritism and exaggeration is outrageous. I am being threatened with expulsion on the false grounds of bulling with no proof of the entire incident and the guy that was involved didn't even come forward to complain about it because it was simply a heated discussion in which were both involved.

I guess the lesson here is, You can't stand up to Bullies because you look like a bully and then are kicked from a bullshit college that you have paid $30,000 to attend.

TITLE: I (24/F) think I need to sever ties with my sister(26/F). Any advice is appreciated.

POST: I am a 24/F, my sister is 26/F. Here is a small background on our relationship:
Our entire lives we have fought. When we were younger it was fist fighting and as we got older it became more verbal. My sister is very manipulative, my parent even admit it. They have said, ""We don't know where we went wrong raising your sister."" Regardless, they love her and deal with her shenanigans; mostly they because they usually aren't directed at them. Things in our relationship came to a head about a year ago and we had what I call a ""come to Jesus meeting."" We said our issues, spoke our piece and agreed we wanted a relationship with each other and we would try to get to know each other on the adult level and have a clean slate in regards to our relationship. Since then, she hasn't changed. She uses my strong relationship and feelings of obligation towards my parents as leverage to try to manipulate me. She has hacked my email, puts her friends before me, talks trash about my husband and kicks me when I am down. She is constantly trying to find ways to be superior to me. The events that have happened recently are the straws that have broken the camels back. I feel I should sever ties because this relationship is no healthy and I don't deserve to be treated this way. My parents and my sister always expect I will just get over her drama, but I no longer wish to feed into the cycle. Severing ties will alienate me from my niece and nephew and will upset my parents, but I don't know what else to do. I have debated talking to a family counselor for suggestions. Any input or advice, especially from people who have dysfunctional sibling relationships would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: I tend to get really fixated on topics for days or weeks at a time. Is that weird?

POST: Hi, Reddit.
I notice that I frequently (and especially if I'm procrastinating on studying) become fixated on random topics that have nothing to do with any of the classes I'm taking or anything going on in my life at the time.

For instance, last weekend I read all of North Korea's wikipedia page, tons of opinion articles regarding foreign policy towards it, its similarities to the book Nineteen Eighty-Four, and four different documentaries about it. A month before that, I became obsessed with the It Gets Better Project and spent four hours reading about its history and watching dozens of submitted videos. This morning, Benito Mussolini was the topic of choice.

Just wondering: is this normal or weird? On another one of my information binges, I recall reading that intense but changing interests is supposedly a mark of a gifted child, but I'm not four years old so I don't think that quite applies here. Could it just be a natural offshoot of procrastination, like I'm trying to convince myself I'm learning even if it won't help me pass my classes?

Thanks for any answers! Helpful ones, anyway. And funny ones.

TITLE: TIFU By drunkenly making out in someones bathroom

POST: So this literally just happened last night and I am typing whilst recovering on my sofa. I go to pretty intense Uni, UWO, both for work and for partying and last night I went to a friends house warming party. People were chilling music was bumping etc. Essentially I consumed 1/2 a bottle of Jack Daniels and 1/2 a bottle of tequila and somehow managed to chat up a girl, will call her J. One thing lead to another and we headed to the bathroom. As we were furiously making out and taking of our clothes, I somehow managed to slip and fall straight into the tub with her, which would have been fine, if not for the fact my head slammed against the soap holder in the tub.

The thing smashes into pieces and my head starts bleeding. A lot. My entire chest is covered in my own blood in a very short span of time. I can't feel much because of the alcohol and now J is kidda freaking out (understandably). She gets toilet paper and gets we to put pressure on the wound whilst she calls an ambulance. When we are leaving, the whole party is freaking out because they think the cops will show up. I essentially spend all night at the hospital, getting stitches whilst J (bless her) keeps me company. I ended up with 18 stitches on the side of my head. But I did get to stay at Js after I got released from hospital!

TITLE: I (27F) have a BF (24) that likes to chat with girls online and via texts- Any justification?

POST: I have been with my bf for 5 years now. We have had a somewhat rocky relationship because of distressing situations outside of the relationship (loss of loved ones, job relocation, etc.). However, we are deeply committed to each other. I have no issues with him looking at porn/masturbating. Several times he has confessed to talking to women online, but usually not longer than a week and has no intentions of meeting them in real life. Is this just considered an extension of male fantasies? Like maybe getting turned on because someone else desires him?

I should also mention that he is beyond social awkward. He has almost no friends in reality (and has lost contact with most of the ones he had) and spends a lot of time playing online and console games. It took him half a year to make friends with the people he works with, and he still hasn't socialized with them outside of work.

Oh, and the ladies he chats with are not necessarily the most attractive women. They are average to even plain-looking. Part of me thinks he chooses these women because he knows he stands a better chance of them replying to his messages.

We have discussed most of this before. He knows my feelings and beliefs about it. His reasoning is that ""It makes him feel good."" I just can't figure out if I am trying to justify his actions too much, or if it is cause for concern.

TITLE: Me [19 M] being falsely accused of cheating on my [19 F] girlfriend of 3 months, she seems to believe it and I don't know how to convey the fact it's completely incorrect

POST: Been with my girlfriend for 3 months now, and we're having some problems. To start off, I'm a guy who pretty much exclusively only has female friends, and my girlfriend knows this, and previously seemed okay with it. 

Recently one of her friends saw me on a night out with a group of girls, and told my girlfriend that I 'was all over' one of them. This wasn't true, the girl who told her already dislikes me and constantly gives me dirty looks etc. The girls I was out with were my 3 best friends, and I have absolutely no romantic attraction to any of them, plus they're all in relationships and I've been friends with them for most of my life so you can see why this irritated me.

Immediately my girlfriends attitude towards me seemed to change, she is already quite an insecure person so I immediately tried to reassure her, I told her I only wanted to be with her and noone else and after a few weeks everything seemed okay between us, and I thought I'd sorted it out.

A few nights ago, however, she told me there's been more rumours of my infidelity. We had a long phone call argument where I essentially told her (or tried to) that I never cheated, never will and I wanted to stay with her. She asked me whether I wanted to end it and I obviously said no. Some further background is that my last two girlfriends have cheated on me, so you can see how annoying it is to me to feel like I'm in the wrong without doing anything.

I just don't know how to get through to her that she needs to trust me and believe that I'm not a cheat, never have been and never will be. Any advice would be great.

I also take my pups for a walk every night (between 10-15 minutes).  I've always been a stress eater and my ""comfort foods"" are gluten free bread and pasta, cheese, and oatmeal with granola.   I drive 2 hours round trip to school 3 x week.  My job requires me to sit and work on the computer.  In addition to school (which is stressful enough!)  I've had a lot of things happen in my life - high turn over at work, close friends getting sick, family member pass away, not having enough money to pay bills.  I take an anti-depressant (since 2006).

TITLE: What should I major in? Something that makes me money or something that I'm good at?

POST: So this might be long but I've run out of people to ask for advice. I am currently going to be a junior in the Journalism School and I'm on track to study Strategic Communication, specifically advertising. I've always been a really indecisive person and I knew I would have a hard time choosing a major. Lately i've been second guessing the journalism route because of a multitude of things, like people and the internet suggesting I won't find a job (I spend way too much time on reddit and it is SO anti-humanities), the fear that the job with be low paying, and the thought that I'm wasting my time in college and should have gone to trade school because I'm not in STEM. I don't want to be scared about my future job prospects. I'm the type of person that needs to feel confident about what I'm doing.

I went to talk to the career counselor about my fears and he was super reassuring. He said its best to do something you're good at and that ""people find jobs"" and I have nothing to worry about. I then asked if he would give the same advice to an Art History major and he said ""Of course I would, they find good jobs as well and nothing is limited by major."" Is that true? Because it scared the shit out of me. He didn't help at all by saying that. All I could think of was the old ""have fun serving coffee in 4 years, blah blah"" and he seemed to think Art History and Philosophy were excellent choices in major.

So the other day I came up with the idea of keeping my same J-school major but taking the med-school prerequisite courses as well. I know, you can't just decide to be premed, but I kinda did. Honestly I just want to have a financially secure future and not be worried and I thought it would give me a backup plan. Is this a good idea?

And then I looked up the stats for med-school and realized its hard as fuck to get in and my GPA is already lower than what most school want, so theres that.\ Does anyone have any advice? Major suggestions? I'm so lost...

I have another female friend who I've known for 2+ years who I hang out with fairly frequently. She is straight, but we have no romantic interest in each other whatsoever, and we are both cool with that.

About a month and a half ago, my girlfriend approaches me very angry saying how she's upset that I sat next to my friend while watching a movie (even though I was actually sitting in the middle between the both of them). I try and find out why she's upset about this, and apparently she had been holding in her frustration for a while. Before she moved back into town for our college semester to begin, my female friend moved in a week early. Having not seen her for a large amount of the summer, we hung out a lot during the week before school. My girlfriend was not in town for this whole week, and when she arrived that weekend, I got a call that I needed to come home for family reasons. My girlfriend described her anger with this situation as ""You got to hang out with HER for a whole week, and when I got here, you leave me!""

After a while of fighting, I ask her why she's not upset when I spend time with my large amount of other friends (some of which are also female). She said that ""I don't hang around other girls. I don't trust them, all they do is make drama. Girls and guys can't be friends without any romantic interest. I'm tired of girls stealing my boyfriends from me, and I don't want to lose you.""

TITLE: High-rise construction seriously affecting daily life - should we ask our landlords for a rent reduction?

POST: We live on the 13th floor of a high rise, in a condo that we rent.  We've lived here 3 years and love it, it's a really nice place in a great area, close to lots of nature.  This past year they've been working on the facade and balconies to bring them up to code.  The noise is constant, and after we told our landlords about it they decided not to raise our rent for the next year (as they were going to).  We really like our landlords, they've extremely fair and good people.

The construction started on our floor a few months ago.  Currently, our windows are boarded up (no sunlight), we have no access to our balconies or fresh air, and the noise is pretty unbearable before 5pm, and some saturdays.  Today things got much worse, as they have to replace a window in our living room, so we had to move all our furniture so that they could construct a plywood ""room"" for them to access half of our LR.  I think this ""room"" should only last a few weeks, but construction on our floor will go until March, at least.

We pay a lot to live here, and while I'm thankful that our landlords didn't raise the rent, I am growing increasingly more irritated that we pay so much to live in such a headache.  The facade of our building has no bearing on us, and will not increase our quality of life once it is finished, but I imagine it will for our landlords (the owners of our unit).

I do not want to financially hurt our landlords, because this is obviously not their fault, but man - I would NEVER have moved in had I know that this would be our life in a few years.  Should I ask for a rent reduction?  If so, how should I put it?

POST: We've only recently been together, about 2 months now, but this past week her depression has been creeping up on her.  It's a sensitive subject and I tried to bring it up but she doesn't want to talk about it.

From what little we do talk about it, she's said that all the therapy and meds she's tried doesn't seem to help her.

I really care about her, but I'm completely in the dark.  I can't possibly fathom what she's going through.  All I know is I want to help the best I can but am not sure how to approach such a delicate topic.

I've tried inviting her out to do things with me but she says no.  I don't want to seem pushy nor forceful, so I try not to be negative about it and tell her it's, ok.  

I've never met anyone with depression before, or that i've noticed I guess.  I'm at a lost about what I can do for her since she's isolated herself from the world.

I love her and she's not doing well.  It hurts me that anything I try doesn't seem to have any effect.  I'm hoping in the long run, she'll let me in and I can help carry the burden for her.

TITLE: My [24F] father [57M] needs a kidney and I won't give him one

POST: To make a long story short, my father is a classic narcissist with a long list of symptoms, which makes this even more complicated. He believes he knows more than doctors and that they're just ""out to get your money"". He's nuts. This ties into him not managing his diabetes like it's recommended and not caring for his feet (he's had two toes and their metatarsals removed because of this). He also smokes two packs a day, has heart disease (& a history of heart attacks), and is overweight. He also hasn't worked in about a decade (for no real reason). 

Recently it's come out that his kidney disease is getting bad. To the point where the doctor believes he's going to need a kidney transplant in the near future. Due to his poor life choices, he'll never be eligible for a donor kidney. It would have to be a private transplant. Of the family, I am the only one that is his blood type. He has no friends. 

There is no way I want to give him a kidney. He's absolutely awful, especially to me and my mother. He's been abusive in the past. Besides that, there's no way he'd ever take care of it, he'd continue his same poor health habits. I'd be throwing my kidney into a dumpster. 

I live at home as I'm currently in school (2 years to go). I already avoid him as much as possible, but I know that he would resent me if I refused to give him my kidney and those tensions would make the household even worse. He'll hold a grudge for decade. As much as I would love to go no contact, I am at home til school is done and I'd still have to see him on holidays with the family. I don't even know if I'm a tissue match and I'm terrified to find out. My mother is supportive of me not donating a kidney, but is at a loss for how to explain it to him.

TITLE: TIFU by Burning my Butthole with Cayenne Pepper

POST: So I recently found out I have scabies on my legs and stomach. 

I made a doctors appointment for treatment next week, but I figured maybe I would find some natural remedies to at least help a little because the itching was unbearable. Turns out among the tea tree and neem oils, bathing in apple cider vinegar, you could also soak the affected areas with a cayenne pepper bath. I guess the pepper literally burns the surface mites. 

Desperate as I was, I set up a bath with everything: threw in the oils, vinegar, and a fuck ton of cayenne pepper. I don't know why I didn't think about this, but I fully immersed myself in the water. I was soaking and scrubbing my legs for a few minutes when I felt a strange sensation. I paused for a moment, then yelped in pain and jumped straight out of the bathtub. My downstairs was fucking SEARING...on both ends.

I quickly drained the tub and tried to rinse out both my lady parts and butthole, but to no avail. Peeing helped a bit, but there is some definite bleeding in my backside and the burn is killing me. 
It's been about twenty minutes. As I type I lay on my bed with an ice pack on my ass, trying to ride this one out hoping it goes away.
I'm such an idiot.

TITLE: TIFU by taking a large swig of phlegm.

POST: Hope this doesn't break the bodily discharge rule, but it says it's okay for the weekend and Friday's count where I'm from.

This is a rare kind of TIFU, it happened today at 2am, I've had man flu from hell, been running a fever with elevated heart rate for a few days, and good god the amount of shit I have coughed up has been ridiculous. 

I decided to keep a pint glass by my bed so I could just phlegm in there & save waking everyone else up. I went to bed around 7pm almost entirely unable to human.

Orange juice is good for you when you're ill  (the pure kind with bits, not squash/cordial), so I shot off to bed armed with my OJ and phlegm glass. Now the mistake I made was having the exact same glass for both. You can see where this is going but sit back and enjoy the gross details.

Things worked out alright for a while, I'd cough then have some oj, pretty solid tactic & one that I should've stuck to. The moment of doom came when I went for the oj without coughing, in a virtually pitch black room I reached for it and I was sure it was the right glass...

So sure that I went for the proper mouthful, yknow the kind where your mouth is drier than ghandi's flip flops, and you just wanna swish that moist goodness all around in there.

Poor decision, I realised my mistake as I felt my goopy mucus with chunks collide with my tongue, tonsils and teeth. Vile. I got most of it back into the glass as swiftly as possible. 

But your body lets you know when you fucked up and this was one of those times, I ran across the hall in my boxers and just about made to the toilet, sprogged and wretched to a standard that'd make Gollum envious. Super attractive, I know. I emptied my glass of shame and broke it by throwing it to the recycling bin about 5m(15ft) from my window.

TL;DR:"," had glass phlegm for both mouth and oj, went for the glass with coughing fit, realised mistake and ran to the bin. Broke glass.

POST: Ok, I'm an 18 year old girl. He's 31. I met him at a local restaurant I frequently go to with my mother about 5 months ago. He's the manager there.

He gave me his number and we've been seeing each other ever since. I told my mom about him at first and she said he was very nice, cute and had seen him many times at the restaurant before. When she found out his age however, she immediately disapproved and proceeded to tell my dad. They both came to a consensus that I was not to speak to him because he was too old for me. I was infuriated and told them I was an adult and could speak to or date whomever I please. 

After that, there was tension in the house to the point where I decided to move out for a couple of days. Eventually I decided to come back because it was too crazy for me to be living with different friends. When I came back home, my parents told me the only way I could continue living there would be if I stayed away from that guy AND if I couldn't abide by that rule, and decided to leave again, I wouldn't be allowed to take the car they got me. I wanted to act like an adult, I was to be treated like an adult with my own bills, they said. So I agreed. 

I still haven't stopped speaking to or seeing him though. I see him as often as I can and am always having to make up the dumbest lies to my parents about where I'm at and who I'm hanging out with.

She was not pleased by some of the reading material she uncovered. I never delete my chats, because ain't nobody got time for that.

TITLE: My ex-friend [30 M] is sabotaging my [28 M] professional and romantic relationships. What should I do?

POST: Hi, /r/relationships.

I had a falling out with a friend and business partner, call him John, who I've known for almost a decade. He was controlling, condescending, manipulative, and unfair. When I told him that I didn't appreciate the fact that he naturally assumed a position of power and belittled me, he didn't respond saying that he didn't do those things. Instead, he threw a temper tantrum and asked me why things ought to be fair. I disappeared shortly after. I did nothing wrong to him, I just didn't care to play his games any longer and decided to finally stick up for myself and part ways. I have nothing but contempt for this sorry excuse of a human being.

We have a lot of the same friends. On one occasion, I asked a friend if I could play a gig. He contacted John behind my back, he told him ""I wouldn't work with Red Cloak,"" and I never heard from that friend again. I know this because John told me. He has also spoken to managers about me which has affected my employment and cost me money.

Just recently, I was talking to a girl [27 F]. We were communicating for a couple of weeks (she lives out of town). She's good friends with John but didn't know we had a falling out. One day, everything about her changed. She brought texting to a halt, stopped returning my calls, and acted very detached. I asked her why and she gave me the whole ""I've just been busy"" routine. I have good reason to believe that she asked John about me, because they still talk/hang out, and he told her to stay away from me. 

I don't know what to do about him. I'm not going to apologize for ditching someone who was doing me a great deal of psychological damage. I thought it would be over but I guess he's still looking for blood. What can I do? My anger is tearing me apart.

POST: Hey guys! 

this is the age old question, I'm in love with a good friend. Met in high school, had a crush on her but I wasn't confident enough at the time due to personal self-esteem issues and never spilled the beans. 

2 years later, feelings still persist and now that I've had a chance to work through my issues some of that confident has been regained and now it's constantly nagging me that I haven't told her how I feel. 

I don't expect her to feel the same way about me, at this point I want to tell her just so it's out in the open and I can get some peace of mind. 

The problem is that during the four years we've been friends, we've become pretty close and I'm scared of losing the friendship and of making her feel like the past 3 years of friendship have been me trying to get in a relationship with her, which they haven't. Her friendship has been an honest and delightful one. 

 She honestly makes me happy, we have similar senses of humor, she's one of the smartest and most beautiful people I know. but I think the friendship is ultimately more important than any other feelings I have for her but I don't know how to convey that without sounding like I'm making excuses for myself and undermining the last three years.

- Only social security income (addl: help with everything i can)
- 50-75k in credit card debt
- Owe 300k on primary home (unable to sell, been trying)
- Inherited ~175k property (rented it out in past - no remaining mortgage - very sellable)

  

I need to understand the best way for them to sell both properties (tax and other implications) and protect $ from rental property sale to use towards general debt + retirement. Thank you so much!!!

TL;DR:"," helping empty nesting parents with social security income, credit card debt, inherited property, need advice on best way to sell both properties and protect $ from rental property sale to use towards general debt + retirement. Thank you!", need trustworthy chicago attorney to discuss protecting $ in selling homes with debt. or open to any new approaches and ideas!  Thank you so much!!,5.375,1.48046875,68,-1.015625,128,wins

TITLE: Me [30/F] broke up with my [35 M] boyfriend of 6 amazing months because he smokes. Petty?

POST: My ""ex"" is one of the most amazing dudes I have ever met as far as our personalities and chemistry goes. He's the kindest person I have ever met, we laugh endlessly together it seems. Now that some time has passed and the magical glitter cloud we've been dancing in has settled, the fact that he smokes frequently bothers me a tremendous amount. 

When we first started dating he said it was an occasional habbit. I was OK with an occasional cigarette here and there because I used to smoke and I ""get it."" However,  I eventually found working out and eating healthy was going to be my lifestyle rather than self-destruction. 

He tried working out and eating better with me (this was completely his own doing, I had no verbal infuence on this new bahavior whatsoever), he even quit smoking for a month or two but now he's just back to eating junk food and smoking. His habbits are completely opposite of mine and I am completely repulsed by his lack of self-care, but I fucking love the dude and I am in a tough spot. 

Two nights ago I told him that I didn't sign up to date a smoker. Over the course of the 6 months we've been together I have made it clear how the smoking bothers me, but it does not seem to phase him and he seems set in his ways. He just has excuses and hasn't made mention of trying to quit smoking. So, I broke up with him last night and he seems perfectly OK with that regardless of the amazing connection we had. Was I in the right to leave him based on my values? Was it only conditional love if I was able to leave him because there was a condition I could not dea with? I need some validation here, because I kind of feel like a dirt bag for not being able to accept him for this flaw but at the same time I feel fleeced that he knew very well he was a hard core smoker with crappy lifestyle habbits and just wanted to put on the facade that he was a person I could be with.

He seems perfectly OK with that. What do I do?," I feel deceived that my boyfriend of 6 months said he was an occasional smoker but seems to have a solid and frequent dependancy on smoking.

TITLE: Am I [20M] unable to have fun?

POST: There is an issue that keeps cropping up and is making me worried that I may not be as fun as people may think I am. For starters, I'm not exactly a socialite. I only really talk with my close friends, and it takes a long time for me to warm up to people and become friends with them in the first place. However, I am pretty goofy and have a good sense of humor (or so I'm told). This makes people think I'm really outgoing, when really I'm extremely shy.

I wouldn't say I have social anxiety, but I find myself becoming nervous in social situations. This issue has given me a wake up call recently when I froze up on a date with a long time crush and ultimately lost my chance with her. I planned the whole night out: going to a concert, walking around downtown, blah blah blah. However, the situation changed and things weren't going according to my plan. I felt like I lost control, got really nervous, and froze. It stopped me from having fun with my crush, stopped me from having fun at the concert. I find it to be quite the problem, now that I'm at a stage where I'm actively seeking a relationship.

It doesn't just happen with people I am trying to impress, too. When I'm just with friends, say, planning a day out or so, I start to get nervous because I want things to go according to plan. Maybe we are taking the bus to a park. The whole time I will be checking my phone to make sure I'm going in the right direction, distracted from interacting with my friends and having fun.

To me, I think I just have a problem with ""going with the flow."" Does this sound about right? I want to be able to go out with friends and let go and have fun. I want to be able to go out with girls and act casual and be myself. I feel like this need to plan everything out is a barrier that is keeping me from meeting people because I'm afraid of the unexpected, even though I know I can't predict the future.

Any tips on how I can be more social, more outgoing, and more capable of going with the flow? Thanks!

I just video chatted with my sister and he looks pretty mopey. They were telling me that he's uninterested in his peanut butter filled Kong and hasn't been eating much. My sister says he's been panting heavily and threw up yesterday. They don't think he's eaten anything unusual lately, but seems to be getting worse every day.

I've been out of town to open a new store for 2 and a half weeks now and have about a week and a half before I can go home. Could it be that he just misses me?

TITLE: Me (23M) am having a hard time understanding GF's (23F) ""connecting"" behavior

POST: So I've been dating this girl for about a year. Things are good, and I think we get along very well. We have our tiffs but hey what couple doesnt.

What bothers me though is that shes claims that she must meet as many people as possible; shes really obsessed with ""connecting"" with people. 

The other day when we went out with a bunch of her friends to a bar, she got the number of numerous guys. From what I saw, it was rather innocent in context, but it just bothered me a bit that it seemed like she was actively coming up with ""list"" of people she can get with after we're done... I feel like if I did the same, shed be uncomfortable too.

When I asked her about it, she said it was just for friendly encounters and that she just wanted to ""connect"" with people. Now mind you, she does do this a lot. Shell just go to some random store owned by a man clearly in his 50s/60s and will be very friendly with him because she wants to connect... I dont think this is sexual in nature.

I just dont know if this is normal behavior but anyway.

Before me, shes dated plenty of guys which is fine. But one gets to me more than the others. Apparently on a trip to thailand, she wanted a lay and hooked up with a hostel bartender. Then after the vacation, she went back to further ""connect"" with him. But it seems now that she has no desire to connect with him, and Im starting to think her hyper ""connection"" behavior is some sort of odd... I dont know scapegoat for something. 

Am I being a bit too jealous? Should it bother me that shes still actively seeking male friends? (its really the motive that bothers me). It seems really strange to me that someone is so desperately in need to connect with people.

TITLE: I am a fucking dumbass who can't read numbers

POST: I mixed up two of the digits when I sent the text message.

I am in a student organization that helps build primary and secondary schools in rural areas in Honduras. I went on a week long service trip last winter and it was the most amazing week of my life. I can't describe why, but being in this organization and working towards my fundraising goal has been just about the most important and fulfilling thing in my life over the last year or so.

I was supposed to head back to Honduras in 5 days. For now I am home from college over winter break. I noticed last week that I made the colossal mistake of leaving my passport at my college apartment (~5 hrs away). Thankfully, I had a roommate still there who could mail it to me. With over 10 business days before leaving on my trip at the time, I figured mailing it was not much of a risk (I realize now how stupid this reasoning is).

Of course, today, I checked back over my text conversation with my roommate and noticed I got the fucking address wrong. 2 numbers swapped places. I don't know if I read it wrong or typed it in wrong. The address I sent does not exist. I am a fucking aerospace engineering student but I can't fucking read a fucking 5 digit number apparently. 

I am lost for options at this point. It will be near impossible to track it down (it's in an envelope, no tracking #). It will most certainly be returned to my college apartment too late to get in time for my flight.

I realize that this only happened because of a special series of idiotic errors that only I am capable of. I have wasted a years worth of fundraising, over a thousand dollars worth. I spent so many mornings at bake sales and sponsored events. I worked so hard and now I will spend the week at home feeling sorry for myself. I want to crawl under a rock and die.

TITLE: Question about Wells Fargo Private Loans

POST: Hey everyone, I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Nursing from a private, 4 year college. I had to take out the Government loans as well as private loans. I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here,  this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. 

 The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.

 I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?

The other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? 

Also, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans.

TITLE: My[21 M] relationship with my [ 21 F] girlfriend of 6 months who is also my best friend is breaking

POST: I am in a committed relationship with her and now i feel like i am not connected with her at all. we got committed right before my college was getting over. But the thing is i still havent cleared all exams and also i dont have a job yet. Now during this phase she started to not appreciate me like how she used to. like she used to mock me whenever any simple thing goes wrong.

This got to me and i started getting less attached to her. Now the problem is i dont have many close friends to talk to. She was the only girl i was close to.Other than that there are just a few friends who are just "" hi bye "" kinda friends. I also have a lot of problems at home as parents are too worried about my future. Now since parents started getting worried and she started mocking me infront of some people it started affecting my self esteem like any thing. I started procrastinating because i scared too much and now i started wasting so much time, not doing anything because i keep worrying about what she does.
So yeah after she started mocking me, she started getting closer to other people which is cool but then she flirts with them right infront of me which is very upsetting.
From a relationship where there was no domination, its starting to look like she is taking advantage of me being cool with her talking to her friends.
Its taking a toll on my life and my thoughts. 

And one more thingis, i used to say i'm going to do this do that, which my friends made me realize that i was asking permission from her when thats not my intention at all. I realized that i am really insecure. I am not happy at all.

TITLE: What's the most badass thing your mother or father has ever done?

POST: My father used to live in Chicago. He owned a furniture store. There was a large business across the street, and the business didn't have very good parking. So, this one employee would always park in my father's parking lot.

My father asked him everyday for a week to please stop parking there, because it took parking spots away from his customers.

On the first 4 days the guy says ""yah, sure. I won't park here.""

On the 5th day, the guy says, ""Fuck off! This is a free country!""

So, my dad waits for the guy to park in his lot again the following Monday.

The guy parks in my father's parking lot, flips him off, and then storms to the business across the street.

So, my father being the natural badass he was, sprays water all over the car. Keep in mind this is in CHICAGO. In the FUCKING WINTER.

When the guy comes out from work a few hours later, he finds my dad standing there with a hose, smoking a cigarette, with the douchebag's car almost completely frozen.

The guy flips his shit and tells my dad he's calling the cops, and my father just says nonchalantly ""It's a free country, isn't it?"".

The douchebag's car was frozen in my father's parking lot for the rest of the winter. It was actually in the news, but I can't seem to find it on the internet, considering it happened in like the 60's.

TITLE: Me [22 M] trying to understand if second chances exist?

POST: Assume you truly liked someone but something happened that kinda turned you off to them.

Basically something that causes you to question if they actually like you or not.  Like you have doubts as to whether or not the other person likes you when originally you thought they really liked you.

Would you take them back and give them a second chance?

I think this happened to me - a girl doesn't know if I actually like her.  I know the typical advice for me is to move on, but in my past, I've had this happen before in which the vibe changes and actually coming on strong and apologizing ends up working.  (In fact for some reason it seems to happen a lot to me - I've had to apologize twice in my past and got second chances).  The only issue is having her believe that you are being genuine...and that's hard.  And that's something I can't do unless I see her in person but obviously her being closed prevents us from meeting in person (unless its a chance encounter).  But in the past, I've written a letter and e-mail and it worked, so maybe there is a way to not do it in person...

Jason has a lot of family issues. I won't get into that too much, but basically his dad is an asshole, his mom is extremely sick and Jason's the only one there for her. He's had to call 911 for her a few times as his dad does nothing to help, yet still is an idiot to Jason.

Unfortunately, when he wanted to hang out, I told him I would but i really really couldn't bring myself to be social yet/ see him. This happened a couple times, i feel REALLY stupid for it, but I honestly tried. I think as a result of this he blocked my number and we haven't talked since.

TITLE: So I failed my first term in University with the lowest average among my classmates, what should I do, reddit?

POST: I studied in Canada for 3 years now and worked hard to get into a really good university for Engineering. My entire family consisted of only engineers, except for my mother side - who were teachers and medical doctors. 
My parents and older brother put a lot of hope in me and want me to become successful. They were really happy when I got into University. I've been struggling though, and I didn't want to worry them as my parents are in their 50s and my brother is already working as well. He graduated from the same university I am in right now and is very successful in his job. 

Thus, being the youngest and least experienced person in the family, I decided to tell them that everything is ok (it's not).

I struggled in Linear Algebra and Physics the most. So I spent a lot of time (maybe a bit too much) in studying them and putting all assignments behind - worrying only about midterms and finals. I overworked sometimes and fell asleep in lectures, late for lectures, etc. I know it's stupid, being only a first year engineering student and already failing.

When midterm arrived, I studied with friends most of the time. But although I understand and was able to solve problems - when the midterms came - I couldnt process any of the given questions to answer them. Same thing happened on finals - I studied every day with friends, but my result was unbearably humiliating.

As for how I study with friends, we each finish a list of questions and problems individually. Once we are all done, we cross-examine one another's works and correct each other's mistakes in discussions.

Now, I failed my first term with the worst average in the class, that is - way below the passing mark. My family did not know about this and they are celebrating Christmas together, as my brother has just got off work. I am going home soon and does not know what to say to my family. I do not want to make them sad - my parents have not seen me for 3 years and my bro for 4 years. As we study/work overseas (specifically - in Canada).

She just told me that she was stressed out from school/work/wii remotes/cleaning up/buying the cake for their birthday (offered to split with her). She told me how she gets 8 hours of sleep but is always so tired (can't stay up to work on stuff because she gets too tired and passes out in bed) 

I told her to tell them about the wii remotes because they deserve to know.

POST: My Gf tells me that she knows that I'm not in love with her because I don't show it to her, and that we should break up because it's hurting her. She is right, I've barely done a thing to show her I am.

Now, the thing is that I'm sure that I began the relationship loving her, I still think that she is perfect in every way, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but she says that I'm only fooling myself saying all that? we've been fighting a lot lately, she's not happy in the relationship and I think it's my fault for not paying much attention to her. 

We fought tonight, now I ask myself, Do I love her? if I need to ask does that means I'm not? then what? why do I like her so much then? why do I want to spend the rest of my life with her? why is this happening, and how can I fix this? 

How can I make her feel so loved that this won't ever happen again?

TITLE: I'm [20F] not sure what to do about him [24M]... [3 Years].

POST: Where do I begin.. I have been beyond unhappy (in general) lately. This isn't the first time I've felt like this, but it doesn't normally ""last"" this long. So I'm going through stuff..

We both have feelings for each other, we aren't in a relationship, and we watch TV every night together. I haven't been myself, and I know I'm extremely irritable and pretty much a ticking time bomb, so I tell him I'm sick (I was too, but it was more about my emotions), and we'll watch again in a few days. He keeps checking up on me.. Every day. I tell him I'm fine, but I really just want to be left alone and he won't. We fight (I absolutely started it, but I was trying to stay away). He apologized, but I still haven't talked to him in over a week, but I'm still the exact same so I feel like I still need to be by myself.. And I just can't say what I mean or how I feel. But how long will this feeling last? Forever?

A small part of me never wants to speak to him again, but the rest of me wants to go back to the way things were. Being alone isn't going to make me any happier, but I'm not happy anyway, so.. 

I am not a caring/affectionate person in general. I don't even say 'I love you' or hug my mother, and there's nobody I care about more. Do I care about him? It's been 3 years, absolutely, but nothing makes me happy these days - I'm not even sure if I enjoy watching TV with him anymore, but I'm not sure if that's a temporary feeling, and I'm just hurting about everything. But then I feel like I will regret it in the future. We get along great for the most part, but I'm still on the fence. :(

Sorry if this a mess. Advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

TITLE: Me [23F] with my boyfriend [31M] 2 months, he wants me to dress more ""maturely""

POST: I'm 23, graduated college and have been working full time ever since. Despite my age, a lot of people tell me that I look like a high schooler. I guess it doesn't help that I'm petite and 5'2"". In terms of dress, if I had to describe it, I guess it would be a mix of H&M and Urban Outfitters.

My boyfriend is 31 and he looks it. His style is more Uniqlo and Banana Republic. I don't have a problem with anything about him or us, but our age difference seems to bother him a lot, especially since I look so much younger.

Last week we went to a beach concert and he said some of his friends might meet up with us. I had my hair up in two buns (think Baby Spice) and wore a loose top and maxi skirt. In the end, we didn't end up meeting most of his friends because it was so crowded and couldn't find them.

Tonight he mentioned how he wasn't digging my hair last week, nor my outfit, and he said that I looked ""so young."" He mentioned that he was a bit hesitant for me to meet his friends because of all of this. He said he is afraid of what they might think of him dating someone so much younger than him, that they will judge him negatively. He asked me to ""doll up"" more whenever we do something with his friends and dress more ""maturely"" (not his exact word, but that's the best I can think of).

I told him I would see what I could do, but I'm just not sure what to make of this. Of course I want to make a good impression on his friends, but I also feel like the way he wants me to dress isn't my style, and I don't want to feel like I'm not being ""me.""

Is there any way to compromise? What would you do/how would you react?

  -zip lining (wife says zip lining is a must)
  -relatively easy travel from west coast (avoiding jet lag on such a short itinerary)
  -no car rental (fine w cabs/ trains/ bus)
  -if we're doing a relaxing vacation, I'd love if we could be on the beach
  -other activities: day hikes, snorkel, kayak??
  - good food/ drink hopefully!!

TITLE: [18/F] My friend [18/F] has naked picture of my boyfriend [17/M]?

POST: This is the weirdest situation ever so please bear with me. My friend was over earlier tonight and she was using my cell phone while I was making food. My cell phone has nudes of my boyfriend on it, I know it's stupid to do that so I don't need a lesson about it please. We've been together for over two years and we fully trust eachother and I'm never doing anything like it again. I had gave her permission to use my phone, she didn't just take it. But I hadn't thought about the pictures, she was just using it to go online on though so I didn't think much of it. I came back in the room and got my phone back and we just went on with our evening.

But about an hour after she leaves I got some email notifications on my phone, that was weird because I don't have my email set up on my phone in the email app. So I check it and she had left her email signed in, I saw messages from herself to herself, of pictures that was sent around the time she wouldve been using my phone. I know it's kind of snooping but I clicked on it, and she literally sent pictures of my boyfriend on my phone, to her own email. So she probably has them saved on her computer or something now.

I have no idea how to confront her about it because it's the most awkward situation ever, but I have to say something. And I want to make sure she deletes those pictures. I don't even want to continue our friendship anymore if she doesn't. I feel completely betrayed and I think that was disrespectful to my boyfriend, me, our relationship, and our friendship. I haven't told my boyfriend yet as I'm sure he'll be mad at me, but I'll tell him after I resolve this. What can I do?! :(

TITLE: Dear Reddit, I could use some opinions on a potentially life changing dilemma..

POST: I went to school for journalism but struggled to break into the industry after graduating in 2009. I freelanced here and there while working dead-end jobs, always for free, until I finally found a good job at a software company about a year ago.

The software job ended up being pretty great, I get to travel for work, make a decent salary, and love the company I work for as it is very small and has a relaxed atmosphere.

But it's not journalism, and I don't get to write. As far as my day to day responsibilities go, they are boring and largely not enjoyable. But I thought ""hey I'm lucky to have a good job"" and resigned myself to the fact that this is where my life has taken me and embraced the favorable career path in front of me. It takes up most of my time, which has caused me to mostly stop writing altogether. 

Then the other day, I got a phone call out of the blue from the Managing Editor of my local newspaper, asking if I'd like to interview for a staff writer position. I said yes, and have the interview tomorrow.  It is not a glamorous position, but it does get me back into journalism and would give me the opportunity to focus on nothing but writing for the first time in my life. This brings us to the dilemma.

I know that the staff writer position would likely pay significantly less than I'm currently making, so if I do get an offer, I will have to choose between a comfortable and promising career doing something I don't actually enjoy and taking a shot at my life-long dream while making very little money.

I'm not looking for anyone to make my decision here, just looking for additional opinions as I way the pros and cons. Maybe some of you have had to make a similar decision in your own professional lives?

TITLE: Boyfriend trouble (20F) (24M)

POST: Boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months now. He has suffered from depression for a few years now and when I first met him he was suffering from a (one-off according to doctors) psychotic break that consisted of grandiose delusions. He went to a hospital and stayed til he was better (2 weeks). We have a quiet, boring relationship, hardly any sex due to his low sex drive, but thats okay. I still adore him.

I give alot more than he gives in the relationship but I consider it worth it because I love him alot. He was also horrible at communication during our relationships. Not many calls or texts but we never went over a week without speaking.

2 weeks ago, during (and what still is) a very stressful time for me (end of uni, court cases, birthday, moving out of home) he stopped talking to me. After a week I called his parents whom I was in contact with due to his mental illnesses, and was told he flew to Sydney with his father. He sent me 1 text joking he might get me a present. According to his parents, he got back 2 days later. I didnt hear from him again for another week. I figured this was his cowardly way of breaking up with me. 

I admit I may have gone a little text crazy but after deciding he has dumped me, I sent one last ""I'm sorry, I wont text or call again"" text. 2 days later he messaged me saying "":'( I'm so sorry. I know I'm horrible, I can't stop crying"", I left it a few hours, and texted back that it didnt really clarify anything for me as to whether we are still together.

He still hasnt messaged me yet and I'm unsure what to do or what he is meaning. Is he crying and feeling bad because he loves me or because hes dumping me? Regardless, I just would like to know.

TITLE: Need advice: I want to be in a relationship, but she wants to be single after getting out of last relationship

POST: Hey Reddit, would really appreciate some advice on my situation.
 
The facts: 
-I (M21) have known a girl (20) for just over a year and liked her the whole time.

-She was in a relationship from when I met her until just recently.

-We have started talking more this semester (we attend the same college and are in the same major) and she has been pretty flirty as far as I can tell.

-She would casually mention she was single, that her roommate was never there and she was lonely and I should hang out with her.

-Eventually worked up the courage to ask her out (I'm very shy) and we went on a lunch date over the weekend.

-We talked after, and she mentioned that she had only been single a week (I thought she had been for about a month), which raised some red flags (I was the rebound guy in my only other significant relationship).

-Then told her how I felt and that I didn't want to be her rebound guy, and asked how she felt etc.

-She replied that she wanted to be single after being in LTRs several times and that she wanted to be just friends. Also said she wanted ""just fun"". I'm not sure what that means.

So, Reddit, what should my mindset be and what should I expect going into the next few weeks? On one hand, this girl and I have a somewhat ridiculous amount of things in common and I think we could be great together, but on the other hand I don't want to be a rebound guy for her or be led around until she finds someone else as has happened to me in the past.

Any advice would be great!

POST: A very quick backstory..

I met a girl about 10 months ago and we talked for about an hour but never got any contact info. I never saw her again until a few months ago, where she remembered me somehow and we exchanged numbers.

We've been friendly/flirtacious, and feel very comfortable and connected to each other.

We hung out the other week and I kissed her. She started crying and saying ""you're going to hate me"" and admitted she had been seeing someone for about 6 months. She says she felt so shocked when I came back into her life and basically has been falling for me and didn't know what to do. 

She says she feels like shit because the guy she's with is a ""nice guy"", but she feels strongly for me. I told her she needs to choose and she says she knows.

She still hasn't broken up with him, nor stopped talking to me. 

I'm confused and a little hurt. I was hoping you could answer some questions for me.

Is it possible that she really likes me and this is some rare case? She told me she never cheated before and now she feels horrible and doesn't know what to do because he's nice and all, but she really wants to be with me too? 

Should I just keep stressing that she has to make a choice? 
It's painful because she and I honestly get along so well and feel like we've known each other forever/etc... literally perfect situation other than the other guy. 

Should I just say ""if you want to be with me, then break up with him first""? And then how do I know she won't cheat on me? She doesn't seem like that kind of person and is brutally honest with me about her past and stuff.. so I think it's really a one time thing, but I'm cautious.

Last May I started working on losing weight. At the time I was 350lb 5'11"" dude. After starting a simple diet and exercise regiment I was a 290lb 5'11"" dude by September. Unfortunately, that September I also started a second job that, in addition to school, significantly cut into my leisure and exercise time and added significantly to my stress levels. 

At this point I stopped losing weight and my diet began to slip. I developed, on the worst days, a two pint a day Rocky Road habit and a fondness for Kit-Kat bars. Since September I've made multiple attempts at restarting weight loss but have never made it more than a couple weeks without a Blue Bell and Kit-Kat relapse, sometimes even a Kit-Kat in Blue Bell relapse. These go on until I start to gross myself out and try to restart losing. So my question for other loseiters is this: if you ever hit a roadblock like this how did you overcome it and get back on track? Cold turkey seems to end in relapse, gradually stepping down ends in relapse, incorporating reasonable portions into calorie counting ends in unreasonable portions. I want to recapture the magic of my serious losing months but am stymied at every turn. Any help would be appreciated.

My friends are extremely supportive and they always chill and distract me until late at night when they go home.

When I watch a tv show or play games the feeling stays and distracts me from whatever I am doing. When I finally fall asleep at 3AM I always end up waking up at around 7:30AM~ with strong thoughts on her and my heart pounding really fast again. When I go out and eat with my friends, a regular sized pho is usually an easy finish for me but lately I am struggling to eat even half of it. I lost all my appetite. 

I am trying really hard to get over this but it is so hard for me at night and in the morning, is there anything I could do to stop these feelings from getting to me? I have a counselor appointment booked for this weekend but for now I am really trying to get recommendations from all you experienced and amazing people to help me not get those pounding feelings anymore and to be able to eat.

TITLE: Don't even know where to start -- very overwhelmed.

POST: Making a one-off account, for some ""privacy"". 

So I've been lurking on this sub for a while, and there has been a lot of great advice, including on the sidebar. My problem basically is -- I don't even know where to start. I know that we (my wife and I) aren't doing a good job managing money, and we've been ""trying"" to fix it for a while, but both aren't very good at this. With a little one on the way, it's really time for us to get on track.

So I've tried Mint, YNAB (can never get it working right so that I can actually use it successfully), and spreadsheets. I'm most comfortable with the spreadsheet, at least for now. It'll really be on me to manage, as my wife isn't very tech or financially savvy, but ultimately would love a way for her to access & manage. That's later...

So -- I know my income and the fixed expenses (rent, insurance, etc.). What I struggle with when creating a budget is the variable costs such as my wife's income (she's full-time, but paid hourly and paychecks vary depending on holidays, sick time, etc.), gas/electric (which changes pretty dramatically month-to-month), etc.

What about factoring in things like doctors (co-pays, etc.), prescriptions, etc. that also happen every month. I also have some ESPP, 401K, credit card debt (for the first time ever, due to multiple unexpected things happening at once... long story, doesn't matter),  Student loans, etc. One problem is that I think the money is too ""spread out"" over multiple accounts.

I'm thinking that one of the incomes could cover most of the expenses, and the other can cover leftover debt & savings, but would like to account for every dollar to make sure that is happening/can happen.

I'll need to make another post once I get all this sorted out, but where is the best place to start? If I can at least get some of the basics down that would be great.

Over the last few months we fight almost every week about small things. Most fights consist of me not paying her enough attention in her mind and me getting frustrated that she's mad at me over small things like not texting her updates when I'm out with my friends after she falls asleep. 

I also have not really had the desire to have sex with her any more. Often feeling obligated to do so. Something we used to do almost every day but recently we do it maybe once a week. 

I have been told that I am more fun when I am without her, and I feel like i have more fun without her. But I really do care for her and love her. And our talks have been civil and logical about breaking up but we are both afraid to both break up and regret it later or both be in a relationship that isn't working for either of us.

POST: Hi everyone,

I've had a really tough week and feeling at an all-time low and just need some support/advice. I am over working and studying long hours and haven't been sleeping well. My whole body is aching from sitting all day and all I have been doing in binge eating. I want to lose weight, but it's this vicious cycle I can't seem to get out of. I have tried so hard to work out and eat healthy this week, but from a lack of sleep, and stress l I seem to be failing. I find myself snacking on kitkat/biscuits/other sweets people bring at work non-stop. It's like I can't control myself. I don't remember being like this. I feel good for the few minutes I'm eating and then I feel guilty for it and promise myself I won't do it again. 10 minutes later I find myself in the kitchen thinking ""fuck it I feel awful, I deserve it."" I feel so shitty and alone.

I was talking to my boyfriend about it this morning, but he has the opposite problem. He is very very skinny and forgets to eat/not hungry and is trying to gain weight. He complains about not getting enough sleep and being sore when I sleep MUCH less than him and work out more. He is not encouraging with my workouts and doesn't even do what I do, and I'm an out of shape girl that smokes. When I told him about the binge eating he didn't say anything other than ""Have a good day at work."" I was livid. I am so angry with him.

A guy she doesnt really know (loose acquaintance she put it) measages her Saying Hes coming to our town. She's from Russia so it's in Russian and she writes blogs on it so I like to read what she says. 

So what he said was that he was going to surprise her with the date he was coming (I later found out using google translate). She made it seem like to me that she didn't really want to hang out with him since he's not even close to her, just a friend of a friend.

Well I looked at her profile (it's public) and found out she commented on his photo being at the airport ""so ambiguous."" So she messaged him as soon as he got to our city. I got curious and read it. I'm feeling insecure.

She doesn't know that I know. The guy is a single guy here and my gf is very pretty. I trust her, but this makes me VERY nervous even though I'm trying to rationally tell myself that it's ok.

POST: Hey /R/unnit,

Just wanted to follow up and post a race report for the Yellowknife Overlander Marathon (which was my first ever marathon) that I finished today!

After running my first half 6 weeks ago and getting 3 weeks of training before my taper I was woefully underprepared but I set out only to finish. My final time was 4 hours and 20 something minutes, I sadly was so caught up in the moment that I didn't take a look at the clock but I will get my results in the next week.

I woke up at 5 AM today and had my usual long run breakfast of a bagel + energy drink. The weather was between 10-20 celsius, gradually warming up as the time ticked on, but very bearable with the overcast and wind. 

Miles 1-13: Fairly uneventful and basically was just warming up at a 10 minute pace or slower, minor irritants like my foot getting a pinch on every step (nothing painful I could just feel it) and my stomach being grumbly.

MIles 13-20: At this point I was starting to feel a bit of fatigue as the miles started to pile on. Around mile 13.5 I got a major cramp in my foot and I had to retie my shoe way tighter which alleviated the issue for the most part. At mile 16 I had to use the washroom really bad and was lucky to snag a toilet out on the route (these were spread out very few and far between) which saved my ass when I felt I was going to burst.

20-24: At this point I felt I had good energy but the wear and tear on my muscles was reaching new levels. Hips, my left knee, my feet, my nips, hamstring were all seizing up and it was some of the most mentally challenging parts of the race.  

24-26: Flat ground and smooth sailing, I was sort of hobbling to make it back but I never walked once!

She is amazing and I like her way too much. I'm used to being in relationships where the girl is more addicted to me than I am to her, so this is new for me and I feel like a total emo retard.

Don't get me wrong, she really likes me too, and we have something special going on. But she likes me as a 24 year old teen can like you... with this careless attitude, this lack of initiative and very hard to read way of showing she likes me...

Right now we are separated by the atlantic ocean, for 2 more months. Every 2 day that I don't hear from her, I get in total panik mode and start thinking OH MY GOD it is FUCKED, she met someone else, I lost her. Of course I don't show her any of this, but this is a fucking awful and paralyzing feeling I would like to stop having. I'm used to being pretty independent and having enough stuff in my life going on that I normally wouldn't be like that. But this time, this girl, I just fucking really like her too much and she is under my skin all the time.

So I write her songs (I'm a music producer) or make her all kind of little surprises, that I know she enjoys a LOT, but other than showing she loves it, never really does the same for me.

TITLE: My (27m) relationship questions!

POST: Hi reddit. I have been doing a lot of self reflection lately, having just come out of a 1.5yr relationship 2 months ago. 

There's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. 

I had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. 

It's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. 

Can anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships. Any more info needed or questions I'll be  sure to answer! Thanks

POST: As the title says I need to move out of my house. My current living situation is not healthy and most days more often than not I cry for at least an hour because of my mother and how she treats me. She is also pregnant. I made a post awhile ago about this and my current situation for those of you who read this and it sounds familiar. 

My boyfriends parents have briefly offered before but I don't know if they were serious or not... We plan to ask them at some point soon, they do not know that my current home life is as bad as it is and I'm contemplating telling them when we ask if it would be a possibility.

 As a bit of a background my boyfriends older brother got a girl pregnant his senior year in high school and she lived with them for a long time(they have since moved out) she was lazy, created messes and basically left her kid with them so she could go do whatever it's is that she does. I would be coming into their home at least looking for a job but hopefully already having one, with a license (she didn't have one, only recently got one) and car, a high school graduate (she dropped out), in an abusive home, in college, plus I cook and clean which she never did. I'm really hoping these things will swing them in my favor. Also I would only be living there for around a year or a bit longer but not by much. Please no relationship judgement, I know we are young but this is pretty much my only option and we love each other dearly. 

His parents are a bit strict and weary of having another grandchild. That would work against me. At this point we aren't supposed to be in a room alone, if this happened that would be common.... 
Also we've been together over a year.

POST: To preface, I was really open about sex in the beginning of the relationship. I told her that while I do not mind if she had done it with anybody before, she should let me know as I had never done it with anyone before her.

I feel really betrayed that she could lie to me so easily for so long in the relationship. I believe this is the end of the relationship.

TITLE: My [M22] gf [F24] found pictures of my ex in my phone. What do I do now?

POST: We've been together 6 months now. I'm her first bf, she's my second gf.

I bought my phone around a year ago and right after it, I took it on a trip with my ex and snapped a few pictures with the two of us around famous landmarks and scenery and such. I then completely forgot these pictures existed in my phone until this week.

Earlier in the week, I was showing my current gf some pictures on my phone and I guess she wanted to look through the rest of the pictures so I let her play with my phone while I went to do something else. After that, she handed my phone back as if nothing happened.

Then, yesterday, we had a pretty big fight out of no where were she brought this up. About how I had these pictures of my ex in my phone. However, not only are the pictures from around a year ago, I took maybe 50-100 pictures since then so I rarely use my phone for pictures and i rarely scroll through my past photos. As a result, I had absolutely no idea that these pictures even existed.

I tried explaining this to her and I said I was sorry for forgetting to get rid of them and that if she had asked, I would have deleted them right there. But she didn't say anything about it until the fight and I can't seem to get her to understand that I simply forgot about them. It's not like I was secretly looking at them and reminiscing. I just simply forgot.

Of course, I have deleted the pictures now. But no matter how many times I try explaining to her that I just forgot, she doesn't seem to accept my explanations. So what should I do/say?

TL;DR:"," I recently bought my gf's phone with some pictures of my ex in it. Later on, I completely forgot about these pictures and now I have deleted them. What do I say/do/do now?", my current gf found pictures of my ex and i from a vacation a year ago on my phone and she's extremely upset. What do i do?,3.71875,-4.68359375,128,0.281005859375,128,lose

TITLE: My [19 M] girlfriend [19 F] doesn't want to be with me because of her career and I think she's being ridiculous.

POST: I'm a student in college, and I have my future planned out and contracted out for the next ~10 years of my life. My girlfriend of 1 year doesn't know exactly what she wants after college. She has a couple ideas of going to grad school, being a teacher, or going straight into her field, geology. In about a year, I will be told where to live and work after my graduation by my employer, but for now I don't know. 

She says if she moves with me after college, that she will be sacrificing her career and will not ever get to be an independent person. It really has been bothering her and depressing her because she recently realised she doesn't know what to do after college. It seems like this idea just popped up out of nowhere, we have been happy together. So she says we shouldn't be together anymore. I don't think her logic makes sense. If she doesn't know what she wants, and she still claims to love me, then why is she so concerned about her independence? Am I somehow preventing her from being independent? Is it an excuse to breakup with me? Is there something I don't understand?

TITLE: Feels like me(20) being pregnant is guilting my BF(23)  to stay with me.

POST: Hello, fellow redditors!

I'm 20 years old and 23 weeks pregnant. I'm in a relationship with my BF (23) for a year now. Let's just say that my BF and I couldn't keep it in our pants and I got pregnant. It was to late for an abortion when we found out. I have been having some kidney problems and the pregnancy tests where negative. So we just assumed my period is late because of my kidneys. We could have applied for an abortion because of the ""special"" circumstances but we decided to keep the baby. My kidneys are fine now and I'm carrying a healthy little kicker.

Well because of the circumstances, I feel like I'm ruining my BF's life. We decided to keep the baby together. And I told him that anytime he changes his mind he can get out. He says that it's his responsibility as well and that he loves me. But he just, well seems sad and stressed. I on the other hand am happy for the baby. Wasn't at first but I just got used to the idea. I guess it's all these pregnancy hormones at work, but I'm enjoying every kick I feel and the thought of holding my baby just blows my mind. In a good way. :)

It's not exactly what I planned but I don't feel like the baby is gonna ruin my life. Should I feel like that? If I feel a kick, or read something new about pregnancy/baby development I'm afraid to tell my BF. I'm afraid how he would feel if I reminded him that I'm pregnant. I know that I should just talk to him, but I'm afraid he will just say what I want to hear instead of being completaly honest. I just wish he was happy. With the idea of being with me and the baby, or if he would decide to leave. It would brake my heart but I love him and just wish he was happy one way or the other. 

What do you suggest? How can I ask him subtly how he feels and convince him if needed that he doesn't have to stay just out of guilt?

Worst: One girl and I had been together for a while and had a rocky relationship with ups and downs. I wanted to marry her, but she thought she might still be in love with an old flame that was leaving for the Navy in a few months for a six year leave. She had a hard time choosing, but I figured I'd make the choice easy for her. Told her ""we need to talk when you get home,"" so she decided to get totally hammered. When she got home, she was slamming doors and yelling at her roommate. When I finally said the words, she spent the next 20 minutes chewing me out in her drunken, slurred speech and slammed the door in my face.

The next day she called me saying she couldn't remember what happened the previous night, so I had to do it all over again.

POST: Hi, this is my first post (throwaway obvs) and I'm on mobile so please excuse any spelling/grammar mistakes. 

My sister is horrible to live with she acts like a spoiled 2 year old I have a scar on my wrist from where she dug into my skin when I wouldn't move fast enough out of bed. 

Today she screamed at me for wanting McDonalds and then when I gave up and went to make myself some nachos she called me a fat shit, a fucking bitch and then she hit me and threw a loaf of bread at my face.

She then walked into my room and stayed there during my rising in loudness pleas for her to get out stating that 'I'm not going to leave until you calm down' even though I was saying that the only way I would calm down is if she left.

Please do not think this is a one off and that I'm Justin's whining my mum says that this is just what siblings do, but this is an almost weekly occurrence since she turned 13.

My parents are divorced and she hates our dad. Our mum is working most of the time to help us to afford everything as my sister doesn't contribute to the household - whereas I do. 

I tell my mum what she does but then she just tells of my sister and then my sister gets worse when mum has to go back to work

I just can't continue to deal with her in this way and I feel so bad because I don't love her when I know you are supposed to love your family til you die.

TITLE: Me [24f] am having second thoughts about my relationship with [28m] together for 3months

POST: I met X from an online dating site, I had just gotten out of a serious relationship and wasn't looking for anything super quick. 

After about 2 months of being no title etc we agreed to be ""offical"" which was great I really like X, but X is a tough love kind of guy. No romanace or cute little things are done, we don't go out and do things together like movies or date nights.  He always says we will but then something happens and we don't. (Example on my birthday he told me we would go to the science centre. The day of he said we didn't have enough time because he had to go feed the cats and shower before we went to my parents so we'd go shoot guns instead, which we didn't do either.) I've only met two of his friends, he doesn't invite me out with them it's always ""I need to see them first then I'll come over.""  He has no intention of spending time with my friends.  

Besides those things I do enjoy his company and I do like him but then Y [20m] has come along. Y texts me daily, interested in getting to know me, we have great conversations about anything and everything.  I find Y attractive, but I haven't spent any time with Y because I am faithful to X. Since Y has been around my emotions for X have been up and down. More so with his lack of speaking to me (he is a busy person but lately it's gone from a good portion of the day to a few words.) 

I am confused about how I feel. Is Y just a temptation? Is Y filling the void I have for X? Is X worth my time?

TITLE: My [30 F] boyfriend [25 M], who lives in Scotland, is very bottled up emotionally and I worry about really stupid crap from afar

POST: We've been close friends for five years, and have been in a long distance relationship for about five months now. He lives in Glasgow, Scotland, and I live on the east coast of the US. We voice chat most days, but often it seems like I dominate the conversations, and if I don't, there's a lot of silence. He's a very emotionally pent-up guy, and especially from a distance (we're aiming to meet in person next spring, as money constraints got in the way of it happening this summer), it's hard for me to gauge what he's feeling. He really hates discussing emotional stuff, so I try not to ask about it. 
Basically, I'm a giant blob of insecurity and sometimes I worry that he may not really be happy in this relationship and is just sparing my feelings or something. I don't know how to stop thinking like this. I know it's stupid and unhealthy. I just really adore him and I want him to be happy.

POST: She and I have been FWBs for a month now. We're in 12th grade and between college applications, family, work, and recent break ups we both want a sexual connection but not a committed relationship. We're each other's first FWBs and need to make sure we're not messing up in any major way.

Neither of us have gotten tested for STDs, but we both haven't had sex with anyone else and aren't currently. We also use adequate protection.

I laid out some ground rules. We can date around and sleep with other people, but will give each other a heads up in case we need to get tested. Also, no actual dates. No hang outs unless they involve sex. We go out sometimes, but it's to quickly grab food or condoms. I try to keep texting for planning when we meet up, but once every while it turns into actual conversations. She insists that we should hang out like normal friends every now and then since we have a couple common interests and live close. She says it's okay cause she's ""partially aromantic"", but I'm still hesitant.

I'm not sure how to break the news to my parents. They still see me as their little boy and would probably be furious if they knew I'm not a virgin.

He's not my first relationship. I'm[21] actually a little younger and have been in about 4 (depending what you count as a relationship). His ex was super controlling so I really do my best not to be even when I feel he's out of line.
He feels the need to have these like little Internet friends flow over into our relationship. Like one of his online friends didn't like me and basically stopped talking to him over me. All of these ""friends"" are female of course. 
He posts on several reddits that I don't particularly care for because of their content and doesn't understand why it bothers me. He is just complimenting these women and loves doing it. He's not trying to fuck them or anything that I know of but it makes me really insecure. I've never had a need for the attention of multiple people but he does. He basically craves it, whereas I find it childish. 
He brags about being hit on and some of his past sexual encounters. I'm about 4-5 years younger than him but I am not less experienced and he always seems to throw the age card out when he disagrees with me.

POST: So here is the deal; I have two internship opportunities presented to me. 
 
The first one is 12 week internship for a T-mobile located in the Seattle area.  I found a temporary living situation which would cost me about 1,100 every month for a furnished studio apartment and all utilities.  It pays 22/hr at about 40 hours a week along with $2,000 dollars for living expenses for my stay during the internship.  After gas, food, rent and all that jazz I budgeted around a $8,000(minus taxes) dollar profit for my stay. The west coast is also where I desire to live someday, so it would be neat to test out the area even though its only a temporary spot.

The second internship is a 8 week internship in the D.C area, in Virginia technically about 20 minutes away from D.C.  It puts me in an apartment with another intern paying for all my rent, appliances, and gives me a food plan. They also pay me 500 dollars a week so around $4,000 dollars for my stay (again minus taxes).  They also mention that they train their interns and hope to hire them after graduation for a full time job which is comforting in today's job market.

POST: Background:  Wife and I have been married for 4 years.  We keep our income separate and have separate bank accounts.  We make about equal money and try to split bills evenly.  I pay for the mortgage and car, she pays for daycare and phones, etc.  We only use debit cards, no credit cards.

My wife recently took out a ""reserve line of credit"" (her words) from her bank.  We typically only ever use debit cards but she was short one month due to a $600+ bill and I guess her checking account has an option to take out the money easily.  It wasn't a whole lot of money but since it's basically a credit card the interest is bad ($1,000 at 12% interest).

I'm more mad that she didn't tell me than I am that she took out the money.  It isn't the first time that it's happened, but we've since paid off the credit from the previous time she did it.

TITLE: Long-distance issues. Plus, she likes me too much? [26M/21F]

POST: I (26M) have been dating this girl (21F) for somewhere over a month now. I recently told her that we should be exclusive, but I am starting to regret that. There are a couple issues: first, the physical distance between us and, second, her disproportionate feelings toward me. 

Her parents live about 20 minutes away from me so the distance wasn't a big deal for our first couple of dates. However, she is an undergraduate in a college that is 2.5 hours away from the city that I live/grad school that I attend. I've gone up and spent the weekend at her place, and she recently came down and split time with her family and me. 

That's when we had a conversation, and we agreed to be exclusive. We agreed to take turns seeing each other every 2 weeks or so. We text and skype quite often to compensate for the lack of personal interaction. 

It's obvious to me that she has intense feelings toward me, but I just don't feel such mad ""love."" Example: I barely use facebook except for the chat function, but she just litters my wall with stuff.

I really don't know what to do; I'm a total relationship noob. I'm worried that the distance is too inconvenient. I'm worried that I'm going to break her little heart.

TITLE: I [19 M] got dumped by my significant other [18 F] 3 months ago. She found someone in 2 months.

POST: We are both in college, but we went to different colleges and agreed that we will work things out for the long run. However after a month into our semester she called me and broke up with me out of nowhere because she didn't see us lasting forever. The first month was surreal, I didn't know what to do so I just ignored it. The second month I started drinking a lot especially by myself and my grades suffered a lot. 

Our winter break started and we live in the same hometown. So I wanted to hang out with her to see if I can change her mind, but wanted to wait till she had time to hang out with her friends and family as she usually leaves for a week for Christmas. 

I then got a text saying that she met someone a month ago and that they're dating. I'm heartbroken when she said this, worst of all is that I asked her if she can say that she doesn't love me anymore so I can start moving on but she said she has feelings for me and that she doesn't love the new guy (only a month into the relationship so I guess that makes sense). 

I want her to still be with me, I want her to give me a chance, I don't know what I should do. If I should give up on her then how do I move on? I've had insomnia the past couple of days and lack of appetite since she has told me.

TITLE: what should I do about my lazy land lord?

POST: Basically, my refrigerator broke… more than a month ago. I told my landlord immediately after it happened and he said he would send a repairman to look at it. I had to leave for 2 weeks but my roommate (who is can be pretty lazy himself) was home the entire time. Nobody came to look at during that period and my roommate never followed up with the landlord (which was his fault). I got back and talked to the landlord again and he was surprised that the repairman didn't come and said he would take care of it. Finally, after another week and another discussion with the landlord, the repairman came said the refrigerator was broken and we would need a new one. Long story short, our landlord has now told us he is going to buy a new fridge as soon as possible, but it has been a week and half since then and still no fridge.

TITLE: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?

POST: Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). 
* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.
* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. 

What do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.

TITLE: What does reddit think of this new website me and a friend made to support my year abroad?

POST: Dear Reddit,

About 2 weeks ago, we made this thread : [link](
We made a prototype of our website and asked for some feedback on how to make it better.

Taking the information supplied to us by our dear redditors, we re-build the site from scratch. Do note tough, that there are still improvements to be made (such as a tagging system & a search bar).

Now you may ask, what is this website for?
Well basically, we tried to make a catalog like website with reactionfaces (as in popular pics or gifs people post to express their feelings about a post) and we tried to keep the design as simple as possible.

Now the main goal of this website is to finance my year abroad to Panama. I am a 18 year old student who will attend university in Panama for a year, but since a lot of you know, this is expensive! So I made this website, which will generate revenue through google ads. 
So now reddit, do you like our [webpage] ? We would love to see it being used here.
If you have any feedback or are a web developer/designer, please leave a comment if you want to help us out, that would be greatly appreciated.

I will be keeping a blog about my exchange year to panama, so that if you would use my website to support my trip, you get to see some of it too! (I will also make videos in full HD for you to enjoy and do an IAmA when im done with my year.)

Once again, the link : www.reactionbox.net
Enjoy and thanks for reading :)

TITLE: Me [21F] with my boyfriend [20M], he's staying out late after work. Help me control my reaction.

POST: So, my boyfriend usually never stays out after work. On Sundays and Mondays, he drives his coworker home, and recently they've been getting a little closer. Tonight he called me (we usually talk on the phone after he gets out of work) and told me he's going to his coworker's house to hang out and play vid games or something. Coworker is a guy too by the way, if that matters.  

Why does this make me upset? I just really look forward talking to him at the end of the night, and especially since he knew I had a hard day today, it upsets me that we won't be talking tonight. I know I'm being unreasonable. Am I insecure? Am I needy? Is that why I'm reacting in this way? 

On the phone, he asked me how my day was and asked me what I was doing, etc. etc. -- just a quick check-up. Then he said he'd call me after he leaves his coworker's if I'm still awake. And he told me that if I wanted, I could call him to say goodnight when I started to fall asleep. 

I just miss him. I won't see him until Tuesday or Wednesday, and we haven't seen each other for like a week. I know this question seems silly, but my neediness is really something I've been trying to conquer, so I'm trying to fight these feelings of being a bit upset.

TITLE: My ex turned down a job opportunity because of me...

POST: My ex and I dated on and off for about a year and 8 months. We were 18F (me) and 20M (him) when we met. Anyway, we broke up once, ended up getting back together, and then broke up again. We tried the friends thing for a while and then things got to a point where it was going to be us ""being together"" while we were both on breaks from college and then ""being friends"" while we were at our respective schools. It got messy when he started dating this other girl and I could tell she was getting feelings for him and he didn't care about her, so I told him that it wasn't fair to other people and that he couldn't have both situations (me at home, her at school).

 I told him that we could not contact each other for a certain amount of time. It's only been half of that time, but apparently he is taking the timeframe very seriously. (I'm really close with his sister, who is my age. She and I talked about this one night when I asked if he was moving on, which is what I want him to do). He was looking at possible jobs after he graduated over the summer and refused to apply for certain jobs or accept offers because they were out of state and farther away from me and he didn't want to move anywhere where it would put a strain on us getting back together.

I feel horrible knowing that he might turn down his potential dream job with some company just because he hopes we can get back together after that timeframe if up. How do I make sure he doesn't do something stupid like that without breaking the no contact rule I put in place? Is there anything else I can do to kind of help him?

At this point he's 23M and I'll be 21 soon. I might not stay in state for grad school (if I go) or if I get a job that requires me to move and I don't think he understands that idea.

TITLE: How to recover for an all nighter, and prepare for another one very soon?

POST: I have a very busy schedule this semester, so I've had 4 tests this past week, and another two tests in 4 days. 

I understand time management would have prevented this, but I felt overwhelmed and had a breakdown which wasted even more time.

Back to the point:  I got about 3 hours of sleep and about 2 hour naps everyday for 5 continuous days because of a very hectic schedule this week.

Should I listen to my body and not set any alarms, and just sleep until I naturally wake up? Or should I get 8 hours of sleep and drink coffee if I find myself getting tired (in order to maintain a structured sleep schedule)? I slept for about 15 hours today, which I could have used to study but I could hardly keep my eyes open.

Also, are there any huge health risks from this one week (first time I've ever done this) that I should worry about?

TITLE: Crippling back pain outta nowhere- What should I do?

POST: 6 days ago I was on a gentle bike ride (along a tar road, no hills or anything). We had just reached the point of the ride where we were going to take a 5 minute break, eat some sandwiches and begin the return leg back to our car when I sat down and felt a 'twinge' in my lower back.

 I commented to my buddy about the twinge, and then maybe 1 minute later I experienced the most intense pain I have ever felt. It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine. I collapsed on the ground, with my lower back screaming in pain and my lower body feeling all strange, kinda tingly (more on the right hand side than the left, especially down my right leg). 

It took 2 and a half hours to return to our car (a trip which should have taken 15 minutes). The pain got worse and worse and I could hardly move from it- it felt like a crazy war movie scene with an injured guy begging to be put out of his misery, just trying to push my bike back to the car. My buddy drove me home, where I just managed to unlock my apartment and collapse onto the floor, where I stayed with minor adjustments for the last 5 days. The pain has gradually reduced, but I still feel ""broken"" in my back- If there is weight on my lower back it really hurts. As Im typing this Im holding my weight on my forearms on my desk.

I missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)

I've lived with my roommate for a month and known him for as long. Long story, but I was in a bad situation and desperate to get out, he was also, so when someone recommended we be roommates, we jumped at the opportunity. Despite not knowing each other before moving in, we've realized we're a lot alike and we've actually become pretty great friends. He's a cool person and I enjoy his company.

Here's where it gets a little complicated. I've slept with him. Three times. And most nights when he gets off work, we snuggle together on the futon and watch a movie and end up falling asleep spooning. I figured we just had FWB type thing going on while we're both between GFs/BFs, so I've tried to not be weird about it and just act normally. Tonight though, while we were snuggled on the futon watching a movie, he laid his head on my lap, kissed my stomach and my thigh, then told me he loves me. I kinda tried to chuckle it off, because I figured he was high/supertired/half asleep (although I don't honestly think that he was) and didn't know what he was saying, but he asked me if I heard him then he repeated it. I just stroked his hair and told him to get some rest and he went to sleep. What do I do now? Do I pretend like he didn't say it or I didn't hear it and wait to see if he brings it up?

We met in high school, and have been together since we were 17. We plan to get married once we graduate next year. I love her with everything in me. We have been sleeping together since we left for college, she is on birth control and we use protection. About a month ago, when she was changing birth controls, we got drunk, and forgot to use a condom. Apparently, when you are changing birth controls, it doesn't work, because she is pregnant. I want her to get an abortion, and she knows my views on the matter. We can't afford a baby now, and need to finish our educations. But she is against it, and has told me that either I want to help raise this baby, or to get out, because there's no way in hell she's getting an abortion. I know the whole ""my body, my choice"" line, but why don't I get a say in her potentially changing my life forever? I want to have kids with her, eventually, but I just cant see it happening now.

POST: I submitted this to /r/relationship_advice yesterday and received no response. So I'm posting it here in hopes that someone will respond.  

I'm not sure if there's a bunch of pessimists on this subreddit; I haven't visited here much. So, please, if you're going to be negative don't respond.  

I have been with my boyfriend for a year now. In the past, I have never pictured myself ending up with anyone, I always ran away or avoided relationship situations. When I met him, something inside of me melted. He is everything I secretly wanted but was too afraid to find. He just appeared when I least expected it and I couldn't be happier.  

Anyways, fast forward to now. He's going to college to become a shipping merchant, working in the engine room. When he graduates, he will have a job that requires him to work a month on/month off. He is doing this to pursue his dream of having enough money and time to travel. What we both want in our futures is to travel. I know some of you may be thinking I'm naive or fooling myself, but I know that this is the love of my life. It doesn't make sense to be with anyone else. Being with him is right. The only thing is, is that I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle being alone for a month at a time. I know that in order to be with him this is how it would have to be. Basically, either handle being apart so we can be together, or not have him at all. I can't imagine a life without him. I know it's a ways down the road, but this is the only thing that could tear us apart, and I don't want that to happen. We have reached the point in our relationship where we see each other in one another's futures; it just makes sense. I don't want to lose him because being apart is something I'm not able to handle.  

Basically, any advice/similar stories/anything would be helpful.

I realize I probably sound crazy and too emotionally invested, but like I said, this doesn't happen often, and I just wish I could know if the feelings are mutual, because at this point I'm kind of assuming the worst (bad habit).

I cannot stress enough that I don't care that she hasn't texted me back, people have lives, etc etc, I get it. but it just kinda worries me that it's a bad sign and I'm curious if the females reading this think not responding to a text for over 24 hours now is probably nothing, probably means something not-so-good, etc. 

If I'm being fucking retarded and you think 24 hours is no big deal and you think she could still be really into me then just say so, you aren't gonna hurt my feelings.

TITLE: TIFU by making the secretary think I'm a drug dealer

POST: This happened today. A few classes ago.

I was in video production class, me and my friend were filming stuff for a project. 

All of a sudden, my teacher gives me some sort of sugar pills (don't know the name exactly), and she asked me to give them to the nurse due to them being expired. I agreed and went over to the office.

I went into the office, with whatever the fuck in my hand. I enter the office, and see my friend,and fellow reddit user u/SteelCasedCondom, working there, as office aid is a class here. 

This is where I fucked up.

I hand him the parcel, and I tell him that it was from my teacher, and he handed it to the main secretary, see looked at me with a weird look, and I again, say that its from my teacher. She asks for my name, so I comply. 

About 10 minutes later, my before mentioned friends tells me that they are quite suspicious that I, a student, handed some sugar pills to the office, and that they are gonna contact the nurse and pull me on for questioning.
Right after he said that, he gets questioned by the office as to what my name was and if I was in class. I panicked. And after third period, they announce my name on the loudspeaker and pulled me in.

I explained the whole story to the secretary, and she immediately apologized for the ordeal and misunderstanding. And that I'm all good, but next time, to get written permission from the teacher to relieve any assumptions.

Don't take pills to the office for your teacher. It'll be so awkward coming into that class tomorrow..

TITLE: Lost that ""spark"", and now my marriage is in trouble

POST: I've never done this before, but in truth i dont have anyone i can talk to. My husband and i have been married for 4 years, together for 5. At the beginning, we were so close. Even when we werent together, we were close. We managed to get through a 6-month deployment for him less than a month after we got together.

Over the years, something has changed. We're not intimate at all, no sex, no cuddling, no time just spent ""together"". We go off and do our own thing and we've basically become friends who share a bed. We talked last night and he says he still feels that ""spark"" for me.

I dont.

Our relationship is complicated by the following things:

- Im schizophrenic and quite often he has to basically take care of me because im too depressed/ psychotic to look after myself. This has put him in a kind of carer role.
- We live in the US and im originally from England. I have no family and only one non-online friend over here. I dont go out, i dont socialize, he really is all i have over here.

-I take so many psych meds for the schizo that even when the mind is vaguely willing for sex, the body is absolutely not. I cant remember the last time i got genuinely horny.

Because of my illness, i closed myself off, stopped opening up. I still dont open up very much although im working on it. I've become this walled-off person and i have no idea how to get that spark back. I dont want to lose my marriage, but im scared that's how it will go if we cant fix this.

TITLE: I know it's creepy if a guy blows up your phone, but is it creepy if a guy suddenly drops his frequency of contact?

POST: So I have this friend who happens to be a woman. She's 24, I'm 26. We've been friends for  a little under 2 years now. The friendship is mutual, seeing that she's initiated  plans with me quite a bit. So I want to clear that out of the way, so everyone knows that I'm not some NiceGuy that follows this girl around. 

The last time we hung out was when we met at a party last Saturday. Before that she hung out at my place 3 weeks ago for a movie and to match weed bowls (matching is where I smoke my weed with you, and you smoke your weed with me). We usually talk twice a week or so. If we aren't in person, we talk via text. It's been over a week and I haven't said anything. Not because I don't want to talk to her, but I haven't had time to really make plans, and I don't really have a whole lot to say. I'm also socially anxious and a tad insecure, so another reason why I haven't reached out is due to fear of annoying her. 

I would like to go ahead and reach out sometime soon, to keep the friendship afloat, but I don't want to be annoying/creepy. Again, maybe it's my own social anxiety making me over think things. But I am coming here to reddit to get a second opinion on whether it's just my own anxiety, or if I have a point.

Multiple different men (26m&28m) are saying that if I want things to work out with him then I would need to cut my daughter's dad's family out of both of our lives because he and his family is going to take over their role.

 (Just to be clear I am not slutting around a lot, my daughter hasn't met any of these men... I just start talking to a guy, make it clear about her dad's family's role in her life and they basically tell me how they are going to take over that role and how her dad's family will start to not be involved. Then due to them saying how they don't want her dad's family in our lives I stop talking to them because I love her dad's family.)

Their basic reasoning is that her dad's family would undermine him and compare him to her deceased dad all the time. He doesn't know her dad's family and I know for a fact they never would. Also, the other part is that he believes he would become her only dad because he will be the one there for the majority of her life.. I feel as if they are wanting me to pretend her dad never existed and I don't feel comfortable with that. 

Am I being unrealistic thinking that all of this is wrong and that I need to avoid talking about my daughter's biological dad around her? Should I be acting like he never existed?

POST: I work security at a apartment complex and for about 3 weeks there was this girl who would come outside to read and smoke. Now I got used to seeing her between patrols and she would usually be out for a couple hours. We started talking and it seemed we had a lot in common and would often spend 20-40 minutes talking a night. 

Fast forward to last week and as she was getting ready to head inside I asked ""hey, can I take you out for drinks sometime?"" To which she said ""yes"". Since than I have seen her in passing 3 times and she has seemed short with me though still nice(like she didn't seem annoyed by my presence).  I also noticed that where she would spend hours outside in the place where we would talk, she now only spends a couple minutes there and than heads back in (one of my patrols has a view of the area) and I'll see here there from time to time. 

Now I feel like she's avoiding me, but I am concerned about why she didn't just say ""no"" when I asked her to go get drinks? 

The last girl I asked on a date said yes and than pretty much stopped responding to my texts. (I asked her out face to face)., so I am wondering if my mind is just causing useless worry because of that. 

If I ever see her in her smoking spot part of me wants to jokingly say ""hey, you're here, I thought I may have scared you off"" but I don't think that will be a funny way to address it if I have made her uncomfortable.

POST: So, I worked at a restaurant as my second job, after about a month and a half, things were not going as planned. I will spare the details. However, today, I knew I was going to quit, I was just going to wait until the end of my shift.

That's when the other food runner started acting like a millennial. First, she almost argued with me over the length of deployment in the military. I thought it was always 4 years, apparently to her, it's ALWAYS been 3. 

Then, while I'm sitting at the window waiting for food to come out, I hear her yell from the other side, ""If you're not doing anything, clean""

Now, I've worked in restaurants my whole life, I get the cleaning aspect and I usually am one to clean but I had just wiped down the counter and was talking to a server while waiting for the ticket to come up.

Who does this bitch think she is? 

So finally, I am refilling the ice and a manager comes up to me and goes, ""is everything okay? The food runner said that you are just talking and not working at all, are you good?""

Oh no she didn't.

That's where I snapped. Calmly though. I was on the schedule to close and she was getting out in about 15 minutes. I went to the office to collect my tips and paychecks for the weeks past. The manager questioned slightly why I was leaving at 1015, I just said I was leaving at 1030 and was going to clock out right after. Our managers do not check schedules at all.  

I collected my tips and checks and walked out. Knowing I left early enough for them to notice and make her stay until close.

So I go ""watch this"" and jump, I immediately feel pain I landed balls first into one of the ladder sticks, ""What the?"" I mumble I start to walk a few steps in front of a bunch of kids who watched this unfold they're asking if I'm ok. For some reason I can't here them I then just fell straight onto the floor, Brian just runs to go notify staff or something but I don't see him again. The crying begins I've realised what just happened and the pain is incredible, I get walked to the nurse and since she's a girl I have to self-examine myself it BLEEDING! WTF? I tell her and my Mum picks me up the shame is awful I get rushed to a emergency appointment at my local GP and that day of every 365 frickin' days a year they have a uni nurse, my GPs a man and the nurse is a woman, ugh... So my Mum says it's fine if they both examine my nuts really? They really couldn't do anything and they didn't want me on painkillers so I just had to wait... Later that year I had testicle torsion.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my friend's sister [18 F] feeling awkward

POST: My friend and I have been friends since high school (I'm in my third year of college now). I always found his sister attractive but it didn't develop into a full blown crush until last year. She had just graduated high school, and I'm blown away. Not only is she attractive, but she's also extremely smart. So I asked my friend to help me out with her. He said he didn't care, but it seems like out of all our friends, he'd be most comfortable with me dating her. However, all he did was just tell his family and her what I say on a daily basis. Most of it is me busting his chops, like ""I'm going to be your brother-in-law"" or ""Your sister is the most beautiful person in the world"".
Eventually, she found out, and it seemed like she's cool with it. She always says hi and smile whenever we see each other, but lately it's been awkward. Whenever I visit her house, her aunt (who lives there) would whistle whenever I'm around. (Not to be arrogant, but I am pretty fit... and seeing as how I live in California, I'm mostly wearing tank tops and short shorts lol) The mom and sisters would also do that ""wooing"" sound like the kids would do in elementary school. I admit it's nice to know that everyone finds me attractive and they like the idea of me dating her, but she gets embarrassed whenever I'm around and sometimes she ends up going to her room. I have no opportunity to actually talk to her. To make matters worse, she's only there on the weekends because she goes to a college that's an hour away.
Overall, her entire family is clearly supportive. Her mother and step-father both love me. Her aunt might even have a crush on me tbh (she's in her late twenties). And most importantly, her brother is either pretending to not care, or he is ok with the idea of it. I just have no clue how to ask her out, or even sneak in a conversation with her. To make matters worse (or better?), she's never had a boyfriend. What should I do in this situation? Is this even a good situation?

TITLE: My [25 M] GF [22 F] of a year has generalized anxiety disorder, and it makes me feel like I'm highly pressuring her every time I try to be sexy.

POST: My girlfriend has been my best friend for 8 years. We started dating when we ended up in the same town again after three years apart, and the friend/relationship side of things has gone really well.

She was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at a young age, and has dealt with that, along with an eating disorder stemming from the anxiety and her mother and grandmother generally constantly telling her that her worth is in her beauty, (along with the normal patriarchal stuff telling women that, of course).

I have loved her for a long time, and when we started dating, our sex life was pretty normal, exciting, and we had a really good time. Now, in the last three months, we've had sex four times, and barely messed around more than that. We've also stopped in the middle of sex every time because she got anxious or uncomfortable, or just made it very clear without saying it that she was.

She tells me that she wants to sleep with me, that she is attracted to me, but I'm terrified that she's with me for our relationship, but just isn't interested in sex with me, but is too anxious to tell me, for fear that I won't be able to handle it. 

We've talked about this many times over the last few months, and now I feel like any time I try to do something sexy, or grab her when we lay down to sleep or touch her sensually, that she's just going to put up with me being close because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings. Please help me, I need advice, fam.

TITLE: My friend's sister [WI] is being scammed by an Internet lady claiming to live in Oregon. Is there anything we can do?

POST: It's a long story and it doesn't really matter but essentially my friend's sister (lives in WI) met someone on Match.com and has sent somewhere in the neighborhood of $30k to this Internet woman who claims to live in Oregon.

Based on [this Travel.state.gov report] (not to mention *common sense*) it is beyond a doubt that this person is a scammer.

For anyone who finds this thread in the future, a [quick search] of Reddit turned up the following similar old threads: [1] [2] [3] [4](

The scammer *IS* a real person, a white female with a foreign accent who claims to be Italian-American, has talked to my friend's sister on Skype, and based on some basic sleuthing has a phone number that seems to be a land line in Oregon. She claims to run an antique business that does appear to have a website, but there is zero actual information on it so it pretty clearly looks like a shell.

So far here are the best tips I've seen:

* Reverse image search this lady's Match.com photos
* Investigate the land line and antique business (not sure how)

I would *happily* post this scammer's personal information on 4chan or wherever if I really knew how that worked but I understand the ""not your personal army"" business.

It has gotten so bad that my friend and other members of the family are saying that this sister needs to give them financial power of attorney so that she doesn't keep sending all her SSI checks to this sketchy woman. It's a good step but if the sister doesn't go along with it it'll never happen.

I've seen advice on here before that ultimately going after the scammer isn't going to lead anywhere, and the problem needs to be fixed at home. I'm just asking to make sure.

TL;DR:", My friend's sister has met someone on Match.com who claims to live in Oregon and is scamming her by sending all her SSI checks to this sketchy woman.

TITLE: I[22/F] suspect my guy-friend[24/M] who wants to sleep with me is still taken and using me to sleep around with

POST: My friend 'Sean' and I have known each other for a little over three years. We're fairly good friends, but somewhat fell out of contact a while ago when he graduated from our university. We share a pretty large friend group, though, and they usually know how he's doing and trying to invite him to our outings. Through the group I knew that Sean was dating 'Maggie', a younger girl(19) from out of town. 

But last April, Sean contacted me out of the blue and started striking up conversations over messenger, ostensibly to seehow I was. I enjoyed talking to him again after a few months of no contact, and soon after our conversations started he told me he had been thinking about me and wanted to sleep together at some point. I asked if he was still with Maggie, and he said he had broken up with her the past month.

We continued to banter the following months, and eventually scheduled our first 'date' for this upcoming Saturday. I was pretty excited, and was hanging out with some of the guys from our friend group today. Sean's best friend, 'Matthew', didn't seem to know that Sean and I were seeing each other, which struck me as weird since Sean tells Matthew everything. Later that day, Matthew also offhandedly mention that he had been hanging out with ""Sean and his girlfriend"" last weekend.

I'm not sure if it's a misunderstanding or if I'm overreacting, but I'm worried that Sean may still be seeing Maggie and trying to sleep with me behind her back. I had a big crush on him a year or so ago(which he knew about and did not return at the time), and I'm worried he might just be trying to take advantage of me and my feelings. How do I broach this subject with him without sounding accusatory?

TITLE: friend zone: not sure if the girl i like has attraction to me

POST: His, 

I have known that girl for over 3 years and it's only a year ago that I understood that I am very attracted to her, more than just a friend. In the meantime she has gotten a boyfriend and i really don't know how to act now. 

What worsens things is that I am pretty shy and nerdy, and since more reactive than initiative. She is the type of girl though who expects initiative in a relationship. 

I told her about my feelings and we have never touched this theme since. The furtherst we've gone physically is holding each other's hands and hugging but I am not sure if it's more a courtesy of friendship. She did mention that she is not that much satisfied with her current relationship, though she tries avoiding exclusive hang-outs with me inviting others because ""it's more fun"".

I am not sure what would be the best way to go now. Most of all I want to  know if she has some deeper feelings to me. The reason is that I would hate ruining our friendship by pushing too far. But how could I find it out, revealing it in a conversation is not an option since it would be too selfish and I guess she is equally unsure about my intentions. And I think that staying by friends and seeing what happens   I will just be locked in the friend zone.

TITLE: [22/m] Having trust issues with [22/f] gf

POST: Bit of background... 

I have been with my gf coming on for a year and a half and we get on very well, have a lot of the same taste's and everything seems to be going very well.In fact it is by far the best of the four relationships I have had. 

But obviously I would not be posting here if that was everything. When she drinks she can act rather flirty towards other men, in front of me. This doesn't bother me so much as I appreciate that she is just having fun and I am confident enough in our relationship to not feel threatened by a bit of friendliness at a bar. 

However this changes at music festivals, which she goes to a lot of, starting last year at a Download (a UK metal festival). Here she woke up drunk and went straight outside our tent to some creepy looking bloke and asked if he would give her a drink if she flashed him, he obviously agreed and proceeded to motorboat her as i sat in my tent dumbfounded. Taking this as a drunk one off I swallowed my dignity and continued with life. 

Now go forward to the same festival this year, and she's drunk again. I come back to our camp site, after being separate that day to see different bands, and she's telling everyone that she flashed one of the singers and that another guy had grabbed her as she did. Her drunken antics that followed was basically getting grabby with everyone and once getting her tits out in my mates face when someone jokingly said to do it. 

I trust her completely when she is sober and when she is out drinking with me its nothing to worry about to much. However when at festivals with her mates she does not know when to stop drinking and it concerns me as I don't see her when she's out with her friends which is when she gets out of control.

TL;DR:"," Had gf with best thing going well, drunken behaviour at music festivals, trust issues when shes out with her friends. I trust her completely but when shes out drinking she acts strangely and I worry she may be having an affair. What can I do?", I know my gf would not cheat on me sober but she can't handle her drink and gets ridiculously wild when she does. ,10.0,-2.064453125,85,0.74169921875,128,lose

POST: I have been best friends with my GF for 8 years prior to us getting together, we have been unofficial for roughly 6 months and started properly dating a month ago. However we both see that time as being together. It's pretty amazing but the only problem is i think she is still hung up on her ex. They broke up at the start of the year and she had admitted to me roughly 2 and half months ago she still had some feelings for him and on that same night said his name while we were having sex. I let this go but unfortunately it has eaten away at me over the last couple of months. Lately she says she has no feelings for him but i find that hard to believe.
Recently she has started talking about trying to be friends again with him (he doesn't want that) and how much that upsets her. She also struggles with depression and anxiety and told me something that really gives her anxiety is thinking about having a fight with her ex next time she sees him. They also have a long history and were dating for 3 years.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over 3 months and her b-day is coming up. I'd like to do something special for her. It's been a huge struggle to figure out what to buy/make for her as a present because she literally doesn't want ANYTHING. She is a very charitable person and is always looking into volunteering and donating. At first I was thinking of donating to a charity/organization of her choice, but I decided that I actually want to do something instead (or maybe along with donating). I have access to a 3D printer that my buddy owns so I was thinking of making something using that. However there are a couple of problems which is why I am making my plea to you redditors!

1) I have no artistic capabilities and can not graphically design anything. Thus it must be something that already exists (for example things from thingiverse.com) (Or if one of you amazing redditors can make me something that would be beyond amazing!)

2) I want it to be thoughtful and a tiny bit cheesy, but something that tailors to her charitable, nice, intelligent traits.

3) I have about 20 days to make and paint whatever object I decide upon.

Here are a few ideas I saw on thingiverse.com that caught my eye:

[Nice Bracelet](

[Twisty Bracelet](

Overall, we are happy together and only ever have small disagreements. We are very compatible on most levels. 

Sexually she is slightly more controlling than I would like.  Only likes it certain ways, gets uncomfortable and upset with much experimentation.  We've talked about this but our relationship is more important.  With her pregnancy the sex has dropped off, but my libido isn't super high and I don't think that's an issue

After a separation of a married couple we are close friends with, she confided in me that she had gotten drunk and made out with a work friend just before she had gotten pregnant (definitely not sex, definitely my baby) and had kept it from me.  She apologized profusely and I accepted it.  We even make jokes about it now (go make out with your other boyfriend, is that girl gonna be the one you make out with to even us out, etc.) though maybe we shouldn't? Maybe that makes it worse?

Recently I've found myself wanting to flirt and make new connections with the opposite sex.  New friends through old ones, hanging out at the bar, playing games at a game store I go to, Facebook friends I haven't talked to much recently.  I don't really have sexual feelings towards anybody in particular, but I miss getting to know someone on more than a surface level.

POST: For some quick background, I began hanging out with a guy (also 17) a few months ago, and our friendship has developed to a point where I've become interested in him as more than a friend. I've heard from other people at school that this guy likes me, and he's hinted a few times about asking me out soon, so I'm pretty sure he's going to do it soon.

However, we're both about to be seniors in high school, and while I would be totally alright with having a boyfriend this year, I've already decided that I want to go into college next year being single. I don't want to deal with a long distance relationship and I don't want to miss out on meeting new people because I'm still committed to some high school relationship that probably wouldn't last anyway. Thus, I've already decided that next summer I'm going to break up with anyone I end up dating this year. The guy I like, on the other hand, has talked to me before about how he wants a serious girlfriend he can be in a committed relationship with.

Basically, my question is whether or not I should tell him upfront that I'm going to break up with him next year, or just let the relationship happen and break up when the time comes? I feel like he should kind of subconsciously know that most high school relationships don't last through college, but I'm not sure if he's one of those hopeless romantics that believes his first girlfriend is going to be the person he's with forever (I don't know if it's relevant, but he's never had a girlfriend before; I've had one boyfriend). I just don't want to start dating him with him thinking we're going to date for a really long time, and then being blindsided when I break up with him next year.

Sorry if this is a stupid question about petty high school drama, but I wanted some outside opinions from other people.

TL;DR:"," I'm going to break up with a guy I like next year in order to pursue a college relationship that won't last, and I don't want to deal with long distance if we eventually do date. Should I tell him upfront that I'm going to break up with him next year, or just let the relationship happen and break up when the time comes?"," A guy I like is about to ask me out, but I'm not sure if I should tell him now that if we date, I'm for sure going to break up with him next summer (because of college).",4.125,2.9609375,78,2.96875,128,lose

TITLE: Me [21M] with my girlfriend [21F] of 4 years, I keep wondering if I'm gay and don't know what to do?

POST: I have always been confused since I was 13. I would usually watch gay porn mostly, but also watched straight.

I would have a crush on girls or guys, but girls I felt more emotional about, guys more physical. Sometimes though I feel like I forced myself to crush on girls because that's what I wanted, but I really don't know.

I was almost ready to just say I'm gay and be done with the confusion, but I met this girl and fell in love with her.

Shes my best friend and I love her, its just physically I don't know what it is I like.

We have sex, I get hard, everything goes fine just like you would expect. I just feel sometimes like I would like a male more, but I can still do everything and like it with a female.

Sometimes I feel like the only reason I get aroused during the sex is because it feels good, and the fact shes female just doesn't effect me.

I have arguments in my head back and forth and don't know what to think?

TITLE: Me[29M] with my long term GF [28F] of 3 years, both ambivalent about having children.

POST: I [29M] have been in a relationship with my girlfriend [28F] for three years now, and we have been seriously discussing long-term (aka marriage) prospects. The good news is that both of us can see a future with one another in the long term, and that we have great communication.

The not-so-good news is that we are both ambivalent about children. It would be one thing if one of us wanted kids and the other didn't, but right now, both of us can't seem to come to a decision about kids. We have talked about it at length, and cannot come to some kind of final stance as to whether we want kids or not. 

In some ways, we can picture ourselves as a family unit of two parents and one or two kids. That image doesn't make us retch or turn our head around. But then detracting issues pop up. One case is my medical condition. I have a brain tumor that is benign for now, but could act up statistically speaking, and that is a concern for both of us. 

Can this change or solidify if we finally get stable jobs? Right now, she is working as a contract teacher while I am in my last year of college. We both are going to get a master's degree, so according to our (ideal) timeframe, we see ourselves with the jobs we want in 3-4 years from now.

TITLE: TIFU by leaving my bedroom window open

POST: I decided yesterday to leave my window open with a fan in front of it to let some fresher, cooler air in. It was open all day and kept the place relatively livable. At bedtime (aka 3 am) I go to my comfortably cool bedroom. I remember that the screen to my window had fallen off last summer. I think, ""phew, lucky the cat didn't go jumping out a two story window huh."" I close the window, take off my pants, turn off my fishtank light and get in bed while calling my girlfriend on facetime. 
SOMETHING hits me in the face. It's dark, I don't know what it is. Figure it was a piece of hair or something dumb like that. But it keeps happening, as my girlfriend laughs at me freaking out from her safe distance inside my iphone. Finally, the thing that hit me in the face appears in the light of my phone, which it's clearly attracted to. It's a moth. I laugh it off and turn on the light so I can squish the motherfucker and sleep tight. As I turn on the light another one hits me in the face. I kill the one that's landed on the wall next to me, and go looking for the other one. 
This is where I realize just how much I've fucked up. They must have been attracted to the light in my fish tank, and the window was open for hours. Now, I'm not scared of moths particularly, but this was an INCREDIBLE amount of moths in one place. And to make it even worse, my fan was drawing them in and turning them into projectiles aimed straight at me. I couldn't possibly find all of them, or get them to all stop flying long enough to kill them. I killed a few but my efforts were futile. There were so many fucking moths. 
I decided to give up my murder spree and just build an inpenetrable blanket fort around me, my bed, and my iphone so I could sleep in moth-free, albeit stuffy peace. I emerged in the morning to a moth-free room. I don't know where they went but I suspect they lie in wait...for revenge.

TITLE: I just got peed on...what do I do?

POST: So this might top the list of questions I never thought I'd have to ask, haha.

Background: Derpina and I have been friends for a year or so, met at a mutual job but only worked together a few months, still see each other every other week or so, more in the last 2 weeks, becoming increasingly interested in her, and it appears to be reciprocal.

Last night (Christmas), we're out drinking like elves, she tells me that she just found out her family has to put her dog down, so I decide to be quite supportive and we have a good night at the pub. She tells me she doesn't want to sleep at home with all her dog's stuff that night, so I offer her my place of course. I offer to sleep on the couch, she insists we cuddle up instead, I'm down. Knowing full well how wrong it would be to take advantage of the alcohol and grief situation, we spoon up and fall asleep. 

A few hours later? Warmth. WTF Is that? Reach down...oh shit, she's passed out, and pissing the bed. A lot. I get up, leave her be, change my pants, and sleep on the couch. Get up this morning and she's mortified. I tell her it's no big deal (It isn't, this is why washing machines exist, and I've done plenty of drunk embarrassing shit so I can't judge) and she doesn't say 10 words to me.

So yeah...what do?

TITLE: Reddit, did I act like a douchebag?

POST: So my girlfriend and I were done with dinner and decided to go to this micro brewery bar. We walk in and this large bearded bartender yells at us ""We're closed!"" I think ""Uhh what? it is Saturday at 6:30."" However, the bar was pretty empty and it looked like majority of the patrons were tabbing out. I, thinking this is probably a joke, continue to walk in with my girlfriend. The burly bartender again yells, ""We're closed!"" but a little louder this time. I think ""Eh, well that is weird"" and start to walk outside and say to my girlfriend ""Come on baby, they're closed."" As I am just about to get to the door I hear someone, probably the other few bargoers, telling me that the bartender was just joking. I get outside and my girlfriend says ""Come on in he was just joking."" I say ""Fuck that that was disrespectful. I can spend my money somewhere else."" Later, she told me she wished I would have sucked it up and gone in and gotten a beer with her but wasn't overly upset with me for how I acted.

A part of me feels like a douche, but another part feels like I was justified to be somewhat insulted and not wanting to spend my money there. I felt stupid for believing that they were closed and being able to be tricked and didn't want to go in and hang out with those people. What do you think?

TITLE: Past and present drug users/abusers/ and dealers, what are your craziest drug-related stories?

POST: An ex-friend of mine (let's call him rob) got hurt real bad a while back and was prescribed perc's for the pain. He wasn't into the idea of getting hooked on them so he barely took the pills. One day someone asked him for a free pill, and that's where the downfall began. Eventually and slowly Rob started to distribute the pills and began selling them. After seeing how fast the money came (over 20 grand in one month) he pretty much was the biggest perc connection in the area. 

At this point he was buying them illegally rather than getting them prescribed, so when his suppliers weren't able to meet the, he got about 20 grand together and flew to florida to get his pills. After finding a ""reliable dealer"" and testing some of the perc's, he was happy and bought them, then flew back. 

First deal back in my state, was a major one. Rob went to meet up with the buyer, and when they went to exchange the product, the pills... Were fake. All of them. In a single blow all his business was gone. 

Now this is where Robs luck truly runs out. Being a semi-small town where this was all happening, the cops caught wind after a few months. Rob had quit the dealing due to the fake pills, but barely a few days later, while Rob was at a fellow drug-dealers house waiting for pizza, things got suspicious. Their regular pizza guy wasn't the one deliviring, but it was a guy in his mid-40's. For some reason Rob opened the door, and immediatelywas bum rushed by 10 cops. 

Both Rob and his friend were placed under arrest. The cops found the 10000 fake percs, and looked like they hit the jackpot, thinking they were real. Fast-forward after court, percs were found as fake and all Rob got was a year in jail for possessing fake drugs.

TL;DR:"," ex-friend of mine got hooked on perc's and sold them illegally, cops found fake pills, got a year in jail. "," guy starts dealing percs, goes big fast, gets ripped off for 10000 fake pills, gets arrested by cops with them, and gets away with only 1 year of jail.",4.8125,-2.3671875,126,1.59375,128,lose

TITLE: My cousin touches me when I'm asleep, Reddit, what should I do?

POST: I'm a 25 year old female, and living with my aunt and uncle until I can get back on my feet. For now, I sleep in the living room on a cot. For the past few months I have, on several occasions, awoken in the middle of the night to my cousin either touching me or standing over my bed. The touches haven't been anywhere sexual, mostly my feet, and a couple of times my leg or stomach (still incredibly uncomfortable). It has only been in the past 2 months that I have been aware of this behavior, but previous to this there have been times when he went out of his way to ""bump"" into my feet under the table, or to sit close to me and touch my arm. 

Lately, when I have woken up to these unwanted touches, I tell him to leave me alone, and he backs off quickly, without a word. I have told my sister, who also sleeps nearby, and she tries to keep an eye out for me when she stays up late. We can't really say anything to my aunt or uncle because of our living situation, and our belief that they would take their son's side over ours, especially without proof.

I find myself dreading going to sleep, and I've completely stopped talking to my cousin, opting to avoid all contact with him at all. He seems to show no remorse for his actions, especially after the first time I blatantly caught him in the act and told him for the first time to leave me alone. I can't stand this! What do I do?

TITLE: My boyfriend [22/M] is a little uncomfortable with me [22/F] returning my ex's things. [dating for 4 months]

POST: Hey r/relationships, slightly petty concern ahead!

I recently told my boyfriend very candidly and openly that I needed to return my ex's stuff. My boyfriend had mentioned early on in the relationship that he was nervous about my feelings towards my ex considering I moved into this relationship just 3 months after I broke up with him. When I heard of these concerns, I immediately deleted my ex off facebook and my phone hoping I could quell his worries. He is still friends with his ex on facebook, and I have not said anything because I am trying to not let stuff like that bother me. 

He has some trust issues, and when I mentioned bringing my ex's stuff back he fell silent. I asked him if he trusted me and he said ""I'll have to."" I asked him how I could do it to make him feel better and he suggested I tell my ex to pick up the stuff from my place. I agreed that I would try but while I think that making him feel is my first priority, I feel a little rude for asking my ex to make the trip. 

He promised he would work on these trust issues, but when I mentioned it to him, he kindly said that although he knew what kind of person I am, knew what to expect, but I had to ""build a rapport"" to maintain and prove that the trust was warranted. I was a little confused because I felt like I deserve to be trusted initially, as I trust him, but perhaps we have different viewpoints.

Are his views on trusting people warranted? Am I an idiot because I trust people too easily? What else can I do to build this trust?

He basically told me that I'm an amazing GF but he's just so fucked up right now in his life that he ends up being a terrible BF and I don't deserve that etc. He told me that he still loves me but he could barely keep his shit together let alone be a decent boyfriend. He just couldn't be in a relationship right now

I understood this, and knowing his past and his problems this made a lot of sense. He was treating me pretty bad the last year of our relationship (i don't mean abusive) just inconsiderate and consumed with his own issues.

Well, two days ago I found out he was seriously dating another woman and I feel absolutely shattered. The break-up was a good thing, for both of us, but I'm stunned he's already dating seriously. 

I feel hurt because I truly felt for him and the tough time he was going through, I cried with him, and now I feel like it was all bullshit. I feel like he actually just wanted to find someone better than me

POST: Keep in mind; when I say'talk'it usually means through the phone via messaging etc.

A few years back - we dated for like 3 months and things didn't work out well between us ( well for her ). I was really hurt but I moved on trying to get over what had happened between us. However I don't know what my past self was thinking and we ended up becoming friends instead of strangers. This lasted for 3 years.

Just last year - I lost my shit and we got into a huge fight which basically started from her not replying as fast as she used to, it was stupid and I regret it tremendously because since then we have not talked much, like none at all. Which leads us onto this week.

It just came as a shock when she called up through her phone crying because her pet had died ( like on a Thursday night last week )and as a good Samaritan, I comforted her. Then all of a sudden boom ; we're talking again - like ""friends"". Why did I put quotation marks? Basically ""something"" feels weird between us - I feel as though I'm only there because she needs comfort and someone to talk to after school, but at the same time I feel like she wants to repair the relationship that was broken. I would also like to mention the conversation we have is 'dry' - we don't have much to talk about really.

Don't get me wrong, she's a lovely, modest person and all but sometimes you cannot really help to wonder if she's putting on a facades to get what she want. I'm saying this because earlier she asked me to mind her folder until we had the next class ( which was during lunch breaks ) as she did not bring her bag to school since she finishes early.

I work with a woman in her 70s that I'll call June. June stinks. It's like she doesn't shower. Her ponytail is always greasy. But it wasn't always like this. It's been reoccurring, but it's never been this bad.

When I walk into the workroom I smell her. When I sit next to her desk I smell her. When I have to walk by the two office rooms that we use, I smell her. I went into one of the rooms after she had left one day and I literally gagged it was so bad. One day she stood too close to me and I could TASTE her stink, like I was at a petting zoo.

I have told my supervisor. Others have complained too. My supervisor knows it's an issue and has escalated the situation. HR refuses to do anything. They don't want to embarrass her, and frankly I think they're afraid she'll go after them for firing her for being old. They have said they'll give her a couple of months (!!!) to see if the issue resolves itself.

It's so bad I lose my appetite for lunch. I'm scared I'm going to go home and my boyfriend will tell me I stink. I think her stench sticks to things.

What can I do? We can't use aerosols because they aggravate people's allergies, so I can't even use febreeze. I've thought about perfume but I don't want to make myself overwhelming trying to block her stench.

TITLE: [29m] The love of my life [25 F] moving across the world, starting a job at my company (7 months)

POST: The person I think of as the love of my life and the ""one"" is moving here from Europe tomorrow. She'll also be working at the same company as me. I've been here over a year and met last summer when she was an intern at another office we have.

People at my company have no idea that we've had anything going on these last few months. When we first met we were both in relationships and have moved on from those because of the feelings we have for each other.

I'd never even had a workplace romance before this, let alone relationship, and could really use some advice on what to expect, how to maintain those boundaries between work and dating life, and any other stuff you knowledgable people can add. I know it can be tough and constraining to be new to a city and in a relationship as well.

I'm nervous about how intensely strong the feelings I have for her are, and the feelings are definitely mutual. We've had issues (dragging each other into our infidentlities) and I really don't want to screw this second chance up. The working together thing seems like a good obstacle to start thinking about.

TITLE: My girlfriend [22F] has lost interest in sex with me [22M] completly

POST: We've been dating for 4.5 years. For the first 3 years things were great, we'd see each other during the week or on the weekends and we never had any issues, maybe had 1 or 2 fights the whole time. 

Last year we moved in together and since then sex has dwindled down to nothing... Over christmas we moved back to our folks place until we found another place to live, and have been living together since April. 

Slowly sex has started to die off. Since about 2 years ago she's had on and off problems with UTIs/thrush and now we haven't had sex (or anything) in over a month. She now feels that she can't be bothered with sex as it sometimes leads to her in pain and hurting. We recently had a talk and she's said that she just isn't a very sexual person (not the impression I had from the first 3 years together). I know she owns 2 vibrators (one she keeps hidden in a drawer in a different room) and I know they get use.

I can't help but feel depressed about this. She says she's not sexual but it just seems to me that she is, but just not involving me. Sex, or any physical affection, is fairly important in a relationship to me, but neither seem to be to her. What do I do...? What can be done...?

POST: r/college, I'm a natural introvert.  I don't really have much in common with my generation.  I don't like rap, I can't dance for shit, and I don't really like the taste of alcohol.  Add some social anxiety to that and you've got my current situation.

I'm a month into college, and for four Fridays and Saturdays, I've sat in my dorm room doing absolutely nothing.  Browsing Reddit, playing Xbox by myself, usually offline (the wifi is spotty on the 12th floor), things like that.  I look all around me and see people connecting.  I have made two or three friends while I've been here, but the awkwardness and hesitation plays into me not really actively trying to hang out with them.  I'm usually okay on my own, but lately I've been feeling kinda lonely.  I really don't know how to push myself to go do things or meet people I don't expect to have anything in common with.  

Is there anything I can do?  I WANT to meet people.  I WANT to find someone who I really do connect with.  College is usually the place to do that, but it seems I'm not doing well with it.  Part of the reason I feel so isolated is because my major is Language Studies and I want to get into the JET program to teach English in Japan, which inevitably means I'd be leaving the States after college.  It feels like anything I would try to create now, relationship or friendship, would automatically have a time limit on it.  I'm not the partying kind of person.  I'm not a drinker.

TITLE: Am I thinking straight, or should I just I cut my losses and move on?

POST: My girlfriend (24/f) and I (25/m) had been in a relationship for 1.5 years, but just recently split. Up until about two months ago, things had been going pretty well, but then things took a turn for the worse. We broke up last week.

I got laid off from my job about 3 months ago, and have been unemployed ever since. Needless to say, it had a significant impact on our relationship. My days consisted of searching for jobs, playing video games, and occasional outings with friends. I'll be the first to admit that my life had no-direction at all.

She has been working two jobs while simultaneously attending school. She was definitely more stressed out, and was having a hard time coping with it. We've been living together in a small studio apartment, which contributed to a lot of her stress as well; she felt as though she didn't get enough personal space.

Our breaking point was an argument about money. I had fallen behind on rent, so she was carrying more of the burden. In so many words, it ended in me moving out in a flurry, and us later deciding that we both wanted to stop fighting. We broke it off.

We haven't really spoke after that, as I want to try and give her space that she needs. I've realized that my life has gotten a bit off track. That, in addition to her situation, seemed like a recipe for disaster.

I know that it's been shorter than a week, but all I can do is think about her and our relationship. I understand that this is somewhat normal, but I deeply feel as though this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. Despite our problems, we've made it through a lot and I've never been happier in my life than when I'm with her. I'd like to have her back in my life, but it's clear that we might need some time to sort things out.

TITLE: Is my girlfriend unreasonably controlling? [18M & 18F]

POST: Alright, so I have quite a few things that have been a problem in my relationship that I havn't been able to workout with my SO.

Some back story. We've been dating for over a year and recently (3 months ago) we moved in and this is when all of these problems became very prominent. 

First off I used to enjoy responsibly smoking cannabis and sometimes drinking with a few of my friends once or twice a week. By responsibly i mean we'd stay in the house, no driving, no hard liquor allowed, not allowed to do anything reckless which was enforced by all of us. Most nights consisted of playing smash Bros on the wii or watching animation domination. Nothing bad or reckless.

To my girlfriend this is absolutely the worst and scumiest thing to do and thinks all of them are low lifes. There is no compromising on me smoking or drinking. End of story.

Another thing is, we have sex regularly once every other day or so. But occasionally she will completely lose interest for anywhere from a few days to over a week. Now this is fine with me, everyone has different sex drives and that's alright. But it recently got brought to attention that she does not like me masturbating during our dry spells and porn is completely out of the question and so are nudes.

TL;DR:", My SO has very controlling and scummy habits with regards to smoking/drinking and sex. I have had problems with this in the past but recently she has become unreasonably controlling and porn is out of the question. Is this unreasonable?, my girlfriend tries to control the parts of my life that I enjoy most. I love her but not really sure what to do.,5.4375,-0.80517578125,109,-1.572265625,128,wins

TITLE: My (F25) boyfriend (M26) of 2 years just told me he is manipulative

POST: I have been with this guy for 2 years. Yesterday, he told me that before we go any further in the relationship, I should know that he is very manipulative. I haven't even thought of him like that before. So obviously, the first thing I did was go on Google to see if anyone else has been in my situation before. I couldn't find anything similar, but I found a lot of articles on how to see if your partner is a manipulator. Most of the things on the manipulator check list aren't in our relationship. However, I spotted 2 that is very obvious: I am almost always wrong in any argument we have and he points out things about myself that I should improve. However, I have never really felt any emotional distress in the time period I was with him. One thing I notice however is that he puts a lot of emphasis on how he looks (grooming, clothing) and yet very little emphasis on appearances of things like car or house. Basically, I am just really confused. I don't understand why he told that he is manipulative and yet, I can't find convincing signs that he is. Maybe he doesn't understand what manipulative means? Maybe it's some next level manipulation? Maybe I am just too blind to see it? He often tells me that I am too naive and that I shouldn't trust people so easily, him included. He is lawyer, I don't know if that helps with anything.

POST: [Backstory]:( He has been divorced and has two children. I've never experienced any of those. I also realize that it takes a lot to be part of a broken family.

I don't feel that my emotional needs are being met. I feel like I'm always listening to his problems, but he never hears mine. He also likes to go to strip clubs, a lot, and has all of these women who just randomly give him their numbers, etc. I'm concerned about one friend in particular of his. He says she's just a friend, but he's admitted to me before that she has a crush and she has also text me from his phone pretending to be him before. He never did anything about it and got mad at me for ""over reacting about it"". 

Recently things have changed though. He's been calling every day and showing a lot of improvement. I want to fall for him, but I keep having that nagging feeling in the back of my head. I did tell him that we would give this ""relationship"" one last try and then just let it all go if it didn't work.

TITLE: Just because you're old doesn't mean you don't need to grow up

POST: The Starbucks crowd can act really entitled, but there's no one worse than this 60+ year old regular.  Let's call him Bill.

Bill and I like sitting in the same corner.  I don't know why he does, but I do because it has space for me to put my stuff where it's out of everyone's way and not taking up a chair - it allows me to be considerate.  When I get to Starbucks first, I sit there.  Bill was so openly aggressive about it that I finally just sat somewhere else until he left and switched seats.

But an asshole is still an asshole, and he'd be aggressive towards me no matter where I sat.  Not to mention, I come everyday and he doesn't, so there are days I'm trying to be considerate and ultimately end up losing out on the seat I like to a third party.  But whatever, it's a seat - I don't own seats in Starbucks and I'm not going to make a fuss about it because I'm a grown up.

Well, after Bill didn't show up two days this week, I decided I'm not waiting for him to have his seat, and he can grow up about it.  He is about 40 years my senior, and there's no reason I should be more mature than him - girls don't mature *that* much faster than boys.  Today I was ordering a bagel - yes, I order as cheap as I can when I'm here - and he saw me and called me a bitch.  And he always throws comments my way, but that was unfairly harsh.  I have done nothing to him other than like the same damn seat and finally had enough of letting him dictate my sitting habits.

I'm starting to bet Bill was raised as an only child and never had kids of his own, because he has 0 signs of maturity despite how old he is.  High road or low, he bitches at me for existing, and I'm not letting him drive me away.

Sorry for the rant, but seriously - how do people get to be that old and have the maturity of a two-year-old?

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here it goes.

So this past week I was in a foreign country with some friends. We went to a club one night and met a group of girls and shared a table with them. 

This one girl and I started dancing and in no time we were making out. I don't know for how long, could have been 5 minutes, could have been 30 (too drunk to remember). I don't remember how we were separated either. 
We were supposed to meet them again the day after, but for some reason we were late and many of them just went home. She didn't though. 

They were three girls who had waited for us. We went to a bar that night and I sat down next to her. We talked, but the conversation didn't go to any personal level. 

We ended that night with a quick hug. The day after I (and my group of friends) went back home. I added her on facebook.

It has now been 4 days since the night we were making out and I just feel so empty. Now I'm always tired and quiet and just can't stop thinking about her. I want to write to her, but I don't even know if she feels the same way.

POST: I've met this incredible, funny, loving girl, and we've been dating for about two months. She's everything I want in a partner, but there's one feeling I can't get rid of whenever I'm with her.

She's a ridiculously outgoing person who talks to everyone around her and is not above fooling about and making herself look stupid. Though that's one of my favourite things about her, I get this sinking feeling of inadequacy when we're with other people.

While I'm social and outgoing myself, I feel invisible whenever there are other people around, as she will socialize with pretty much all of them and barely look at or speak to me for varying periods of time. If we're having a cozy moment alone in our school cafeteria she might suddenly jump up and walk over to greet one of her friends if they walk into the room, as if I'm not there at all. I feel like I can be replaced at any point in time seeing as I'm so easily deprioritised. 

I can't just tell her she needs to stop either, as the last thing I want is her spending time with me because she feels like she has to.
I end up not really knowing what to do; should I engage with their conversations and become the kind of boyfriend who never lets her talk to people by herself? Should I get busy with something else pretending I don't feel like crap? Am I just overthinking this whole thing?

TITLE: Help me [17/M] understand I don't need my ex's [17/F] affection

POST: I was in this 5-6 month long-distance relationship over a year ago with a girl I met online. We talked 24/7, I used to visit her every month and I thought she was the love of my life. Only recently did I realise I did not actually like **anything** about her as a person, other than the fact that she *loved* me. She was far too self-centred, sometimes mean and rather immature. She hurt me emotionally a lot, making me jealous and stuff. We broke up in the spring of 2014.

Fast forward to this summer: we hadn't talked at all, other than quick Facebook chats every few months that lead to nowhere and a few drunk calls from either one of us. Last month, we met where I live and she stayed at my place for a couple of days (I live alone). We felt great together, had an amazing time and were on good terms when she left. She even said she still loves me.

We then ended up getting into another fight over a T-shirt she **stole** from me (I would suggest she's crazy, but maybe I'm overreacting) and we stopped talking.

Now, I ask you, why the hell do I still care? Why do I sometimes think of her, when it's clear even to me now that I don't like anything about her? It might be just because I haven't been emotionally close to anyone else in the past 18+ months, haven't hugged anyone properly, haven't had anyone else reciprocate these feelings of simple human affection. Because I think that's what I need – affection. And I think I associate that with her, which is wrong.

How do I get over this? How can my brain fully understand that I don't need **her** affection?

I've been reading about Buddhism and pretty much the underlying principle of Buddhism is that you should get rid of attachment, be that to people or things. What are your suggestions towards that?

I clearly do not want or need a romantic relationship, so what can I do to get rid of these wrong feelings?

Hopefully I managed to explain everything well enough.

TITLE: She [20 F] said to me [24 M] ""(...) if there's going to be another time"" How should I respond to that?

POST: I met this one girl and asked her out. We didn't know each other, only had like 5min. conversation before.
Now, yesterday was our 3rd date. She initiated it, but at the scene suddenly seemed distant. She even said a few things that baffled me:

1) She mentioned going abroad in two years to finish her degree.
(it's like she wanted me to lose interest in her)

2) She told me that her mother tried to match her with some of her colleagues over the last few years, but she found them boring or selfish. It's like she wanted to show me that she was not in a commited relationship for a long time.

3) Later we got some ice cream and she offered to pay for everything. I said OK, because I would have to change my money first. So she paid, and I told her I'll change it on the way back.
But there was no such possibility so I said (while getting out of a tram): ""I'll return it another time"" and she responded:
""If there is going to be another time"". I was so baffled by this that I didn't respond. I just kissed her and had to leave.

Now, as you can see, she's less interested in me than I am in her. I suppose I have three options now:

a) try to schedule a next date and make it really special

b) give her some space and time to rethink (?)

c) she's not undecided - I already lost her and should let her go and move on already

TITLE: I'm [22f] developing feelings for an introvert [24m] and don't know how to handle it

POST: I've [22f] always been a very outgoing and confident person and have never had any issues with guys or dating. I've always thought I had men figured out and knew how to get their attention. 

In September I transferred to a different university where I met this guy [24m]. He is extremely attractive, funny, smart, ambitious and masculine. Everything I look for in a guy. However, he is totally a closed book. He is not shy by any stretch, but we have been constantly around each other for 3 months now and I know next to nothing about him on a personal level. He doesn't even have a facebook.

We are in the same group of friends at school and spend a lot of time around each other. We often carpool, study together and get drinks after class etc. We have also have spent quite some time alone, but thats only when we study and the rest of our friends leave or when I give him a ride home.

There are some days where he will start to open up to me a bit and flirt, and I can really feel the chemistry between us. But there will be other days where he will go the entire day without saying hi or talking to me (or anyone for that matter) even though we are in all of each others lectures.

Everyone in our group of friends agrees that he is strangely private, but they've accepted it and say that it's because he's an introvert. However, I don't want to accept it because I really want to get to know him better because I can't remember the last time I've felt this way about a guy.

I've tried to show my interest by inviting him to events and I always help him out with assignments and invite him to have lunch with me. He almost always accepts but has never done the same for me. 

I can't read him at all. He's always in his own little world and I just want to know if he has any interest in me at all. The mixed signals are frustrating.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for close to a year now. We are both from India originally, but both of our families immigrated to Canada when we were kids. 

So the topic came up while we were talking about our past relationships with a group of friends. We started talking about interracial relationships, and I mentioned how I had never been in a serious  relationship with someone outside my race. Everyone got curious when I stated this, and asked me what the reason was. I responded saying I was unwilling to have a relationship with someone without a similar background to myself, primarily because I feel there would be too many differences to overcome for it to work. I understand it works with many couples, however personally I feel this would not be the case for myself. 

After my response, everyone, including my girlfriend, remarked how they felt that was really racist for me to say, and that plenty of interracial relationships work in the real world. After we got home, my girlfriend was especially angry with me, stating how she felt that was a complete bigoted view to have. I tried explaining that it wasn't because I believed my race was superior or whatever else, just that I felt everything from food to religion, to cultural values would be too different to fully overcome. She was unwilling to accept that however.

POST: About two days ago actually I had a really shitty morning.

Firstly my alarm does not go off. So I didn't have breakfast. Rush to the train station and I miss my train by 15 seconds.

So, minding my own business as I finally make it to my campus I decide to hit up McDonald's (their hash browns are really nice in Australia).
So as I'm walking down campus to get breakfast I hear a whirling sound. Wheels. Roller blades?

I turn my head around and for about half a second I spot a little girl maybe 4 or 5 years old on a scooter. Then suddenly everything stops and I hear a sickening bang. I didn't feel anything so I thought I imagined it but sure enough she had fallen over, her little razor scooter tipped over with her.

I freak out and ask her if she's okay, if she's bleeding, if her parents are nearby. On the inside I was swearing like a sailor.

Luckily her dad was not too far behind, along with the girl's little sister. She wasn't hurt, there was no bleeding and by the end of it they're all consoling me instead.

TITLE: TSH level variation and suggestions for possible medical tests

POST: In June I took a blood test in Belgium, which among other things checked for TSH levels. The level was 2.9. A month later I took another blood test in my home country, Norway (I'm an expat), which had a score of 1. Both tests were taken at around 11 AM, with no food beforehand (don't know if this is relevant at all). Should the TSH level vary this much? The ranges were the same at both laboratories (0.3 - 4.2). The latter laboratory also tested for Free T4 and Anti-TPO, which came back normal (16 (range: 11 - 22) and 97 (range 50 - 150) respectively).

26 year old Caucasian male, approximately 70 kg, 182 cm. Not taking any medications. Blood pressure 133/86, taken this Monday. Symptoms in no particular order:

* Frequent bowel movements (at least four times per day)

Bit of backstory, I live on campus at a university near an hour away from home. Parents said they were leaving out of town this Thursday, and I, as the typical horny college guy, tell my SO to come over for the weekend and we can have a great time. I've been planning stuff I was going to do and running the gist of it by the SO and she was ecstatic. All I needed now was to buy the toys, lube, and more toys! 

Of course I go to trusty Amazon and order it all there, one problem though. I ordered it and thought all was good, order says delivered, check my post at the school, says no package. I thought that was weird, and I immediately got scared. I checked Amazon and I realized I ordered it all to my house, and not my dorm.

A few months ago, my best friend drunk texts me that she's interested in me.  I tell her I feel the same way, but there are some complicating factors going on on her end.  We're in this weird limbo for a few months, and then about a month ago she tells me that she thinks it doesn't feel right and wants to just be friends.

I was pretty hurt over it (especially because she brought it up).  We stayed in contact for a few weeks (against the advice of all my other friends).  One night I drunk texted her that I'm still in love with her.  This was about two weeks ago.

She didn't reply.  She's always good about replying to texts, so this is definitely intentional.  I texted several apologies the next day, as it was obviously a drunken outburst borne of hurt feelings and frustration, and asked if she could just ignore it.  She eventually texted me back a few days later, and her tone was very cold and distant, as she is known to do when she is pissed off.

I give her a few days and then tell her that I'm sad that things are off, and I hope that things can go back to normal.  No response.  Eventually she texted me a couple nights ago, asking me something random.  I replied and asked her an equally innocuous question.  No response.

Can someone explain to me what is going on?  How long is this going to continue for, we're at 2 weeks now.  Before all this happened, I told her that I was still struggling with it and she said that she couldn't imagine not having me as a friend.  She has called me her best friend on numerous occasions.

TITLE: Me [22 M] with my SO [23 F] of 3 months - seems unenthusiastic when asking me if I want to hang out

POST: We hang out often, we thoroughly enjoy each other's company, and don't really have any issues in our relationship. Pretty vanilla. But a small thing that's been bothering me lately is how she goes about asking me if I want to hang out with her.

If she's going out to a party, or out with some of our mutual friends, she will typically ask me if I want to come along. But when she asks - and I think it's something she's unaware of - she doesn't seem like she really wants me to be there. For example, she never explicitly states that she wants me to be there, it's usually just ""Hey, there's a party"" or ""Hey, do you want to come hang out with x & y"". And if I say no, and I give some sort of reason, she never fights to get me to go. She never really shows any emotion when I say yes or no. She just says ""all right"" and moves on. I don't think she's ever explicitly stated that she wants me to go. How i've felt about it recently, is that she acts as if she's completely okay with me not going and that she's asking because she feels she's obligated to, because i'm her boyfriend.

I love that she asks and lets me know almost every time she goes out, but it just doesn't make me feel very special when she words it in that sort of way. I'm going to bring it up soon and tell her it bothers me, but I wanted some input from unbiased people beforehand. I might be looking too much into it, not sure.

TITLE: My Parenting Opposite

POST: Tonight I met my parenting opposite and I wish I could say it was a good experience, that we learned from each other, had a good calm discussion and thoughtfully went our separate ways pondering the others perspective.  I can't say any of that.  I can say that she watched her son utilizing public property incorrectly and instead of correcting him and using it as a teaching moment she stood by and watched as my Mom attempted to correct him repeatedly, until finally telling the child she needed his full name to report to the police after they found the park property broken due to his choices.  This woman then had the amazing audacity to come to my Mom and tell her how RUDE it was to scare her child by mentioning the cops!  I jumped in with some words of my own and she told me how this is not how Christ would do things.  I absolutely disagree, Christ was and is a great man because He does NOT accept improper behavior.  He in fact threw the money changers out of the temple.  Being Christlike does not being a doormat and never getting mad.  Being Christlike means teaching children right from wrong even if their parents won't, making tough calls and being brave.  We prayed for that little guy and his mother tonight that they might learn from this, but I doubt she will teach her son anything other than how his ego is worth more than being responsible for your actions and choices.

TITLE: How would one go about making silicone sex toys?

POST: I first saw [this] how-to on making silicone dildos, but the suggestion that one use silicone caulking seemed a bit sketchy, and a bit more searching around seemed to confirm that silicone caulking is probably not great for putting in your body. The clay model and latex mold method seems unproblematic, but I could be wrong.

More research seemed to suggest that platinum (rather than tin) cured silicone provides minimal interactions with bodily functions. One can purchase platinum-curing silicone mixes from art stores. I found a [shop] which deals with making molds/casts and has a pretty good selection of platinum-curing silicones.

But the consensus also seems to be that silicone used for sex toys should be ""medical grade"". I can't seem to figure out what that means and if it is significantly chemically different from the kind of silicone you'd get from an art store, nor where one would get small amounts of it that would be simple to mix in a ""homemade"" setting. I do know that there are a number of people who make silicone sex toys in their homes (or very small shops), but no one I've contacted is willing to divulge their methods (unsurprisingly). One person seemed to use both ""medical grade"" and ""art store"" silicone, perhaps coating the inside of a mold with the former and then filling with the latter (just a guess).

TL;DR:"," How would one go about making silicone sex toys using medical grade silicone caulking?

TITLE: Me [21M] with my [20F] girlfriend for 1 1/2 years, I caught her texting the guy she originally broke up with me for

POST: I've been dating this girl for a while longest relationship I have ever been in. I honestly can say that she's my first true love. But this girl has done some unfair things to me. 

 In January she broke up with me because as she claimed "" I don't treat her like she's my girlfriend."" About a month later we work it out and continue things back up. I then found out the truth about why we broke up, it was another dude. I was literally destroyed, that month we broke up was one of the hardest months of my life. I thought it was my fault I lost my girl, so I fixed it only to find out it wasn't me it was someone else. But that's not all. I forgive her because I love her so much and she promised to block all communications from him. Then I go and see on her Facebook she was messaging some guy (not the dude she ended it for) and she was telling him that if he was living near her it would be him and not me.  Confronted her about it and still forgave her. Well since there is no trust anymore I checked her Facebook last night. And she had messages from 2 months ago saying that they would hangout. ""He said why don't why hangout is it because of your bf?"" And she said no. 

Now here's the tricky part. 

I plan on ending it probably this week. But I have a good paying job for my age but unfortunately it drug tests randomly. So I have to quit but it's gonna be a lot harder to get her off my mind that way.  My intentions were to move after I believe I have enough money to move out and live with my best friend. But if I end it with her there is nothing left for me In this town and l probably will be extremely depressed. Regardless I need to end it but should I go quit my job with only 2 months experience but 6 in a industrial warehouse and move?

We talked and she said I'm too clingy and jealous of our roommate [22] who is lesbian and only wants my wife and doesnt hide that fact. She spends all her free time with said roommate ( or so I feel) and screams at me at the smallest thing. The roommate is her best (and ONLY) friend she has who lives in our area code and they do nothing but air at the house and RP(roleplay) characters they created on IM 

 She said she wants to try again with us and apparently didn't think breaking it off meant divorce or that I would want nothing to do with her besides our daughter. 

She doesn't work and and my paranoia has me thinking the only reason she took it all back is because of the fact I am the primary income, our roommate refuses to pay more the 150 which isn't even 1/4 of our bills

The sex is gone, we rarely do anything together. It all started going down hill after the birth of our daughter, I don't blame her for the sex issue because I honestly beleive it is the birth control ""implanon""

James: Guy, 18, was the more innocent of the group, very sweet, said he, ""cherished"" our friendship. I babied him to death, eventually he wanted to date (something I've wanted for a while, I loved this guy). Dated for a few weeks, everything was fine, started making out--he freaked out but wouldn't tell me why. Next day broke up with me because he couldn't get passed the, ""friend"" thing. Few days later he's drooling over 14 year old freshman. Tried to talk to him about it, he completely ignored me and wouldn't even talk to me even though he preached about how our friendship meant the world to him...

POST: Short and to the point:
He's a great guy to other women in his life but me. He flirts with co-workers (even ask them to meet up for a drink, goes wine tasting with them, fixes things around their homes etc)

I don't think he's getting too far with these girls but I think he's hoping.
Honestly, I don't know what his deal is. All I do know is that they aren't his gf, I am but I'm not getting the perks those girls seem to get from him.
I asked him to help me with somethings around my house and it was like pulling teeth. He got my hopes up about us going on a romantic vacation and after 2 months he has not purchased the tickets but has excuse after excuse. 
Our 1st big vacation together and he downgrades to ""Lets go camping an hour away over a weekend instead.""

I'm heartbroken, disappointed, and so my question 
Why ask a girl to be your gf and tell her you love her (never felt this way about anyone yada yada yada) but treat her the way I'm being treated??

I'm unhappy and feeling like I'm going to call it quits any day now.

Recently a close friend of mine has been going through a tough time and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing to offer support. Most of my friends or family I contact through text or messenger so touching or bringing food or anything of actually being there is out of the picture. Sometimes they are also many miles away. 

I know the classic ""Do you want to talk about it?"" Or ""Just know I'm here for you"" lines but what the heck does that even mean? What usually happens is I say those things, they say something, I say sorry you are feeling that way, then they say something else and I'm stuck for words. I can't just keep saying sorry over and over. There's just so many times I can say ""Oh no.. :("" or ""That's not good.. :/"" I know being supportive and comforting means to listen and be there, but I just find it really difficult when it's all in text and I'm not able to just hold them or just nod and give them my full attention. 

Can you guys please tell me how I can be the best support I can be?? The do's and don'ts.

My partner ""John"" and I are best friends with another couple who will probably be splitting up soon. ""Maria"" and ""David"" have been together for about 4 years, and John and Maria have been good friends since high school. David has been really good to and for Maria and is an all around great guy. Maria confided in me recently however that he has been thinking about breaking up for a lot of typical feelings-reasons (not ready for the long term relationship that she wants, etc). She's devastated about it. Although I'm pretty frustrated with David because he's being really wishy washy about what he wants and hurting her in the process, it's not exactly an unpardonable offense. I know that breakups are really hard. I still love both of them no matter what.

That said, what is the best way to handle this from an outside perspective? We live in a small town where everybody knows each other and have a large friend group that gets together multiple times weekly and host a big party at our place once every couple weeks. We have multiple tabletop games going that both of them are involved in. How can john and I remain friends with both of them under the circumstances?

Still, he'd say he'd rather spend time with me.

POST: Hoping for the best here but want to see what others might glean from this. We have been dating for a little over 2 months, instant connection, spent a lot of time together the first month and a half. Then he got busy at work and side project and started being around less and responding intermittently to texts. 

I sensed something was up (assuming just stressed out) and started inviting him to more things and for him to stay over at my place more - with the intent of ""hey this will take your mind off stuff"" - ""not hey i am needy.""

Anyways, he was going to be out of town for the day and I sent him a text with a (tasteful and cute) photo of me and texted ""if you want to cuddle when you get back"" - no response. He had mentioned having issues with texts so I texted him a little later and was like ""did you get the photo?"" and he responded **""yeah, sorry it did. it's not a great time but we should talk about this""** and I responded that that would be good.

The next day I texted back that I wanted to talk and thanked him for bringing that up and said I sensed he was stressed which is why i was inviting him out and offering my company and he responded **""yeah. sorry these projects just crept up on me""**

So that is it, his responses were kind of vague so wondering what you all glean from it. I really like him and he has said the same about me, we haven't officially called whatever it is a relationship but i feel like it is, so this weirdness is really stressing me out.
