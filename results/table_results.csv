TITLE: My [19F] friend [19M] wants to hang out with me tonight, but I already have plans...

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out. Josh and I have only started being close for about half a year - but during that time we've gotten really close. If I tell him that I'm hanging out with my friends, he'll probably want to join in, because I sometimes include him with my other friends, but this hangout was supposed to be a bit more intimate. Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation. Am I being unreasonable?

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out.

If I tell him that I'm hanging out with my friends, he'll probably want to join in, because I sometimes include him with my other friends, but this hangout was supposed to be a bit more intimate. Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation. Am I being unreasonable?

TITLE: My [19F] friend [19M] wants to hang out with me tonight, but I already have plans...

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out. Josh and I have only started being close for about half a year - but during that time we've gotten really close. If I tell him that I'm hanging out with my friends, he'll probably want to join in, because I sometimes include him with my other friends, but this hangout was supposed to be a bit more intimate. Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation. Am I being unreasonable?

TITLE: My [19F] friend [19M] wants to hang out with me tonight, but I already have plans...

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out. Josh and I have only started being close for about half a year - but during that time we've gotten really close. If I tell him that I'm hanging out with my friends, he'll probably want to join in, because I sometimes include him with my other friends, but this hangout was supposed to be a bit more intimate. Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation. Am I being unreasonable?

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out.

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out.

Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation.

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out.

TITLE: My [19F] friend [19M] wants to hang out with me tonight, but I already have plans...

POST: I've made plans with a group of friends yesterday for New Year's Eve. Today, my close friend, let's call him Josh, wants to hang out. Josh and I have only started being close for about half a year - but during that time we've gotten really close. If I tell him that I'm hanging out with my friends, he'll probably want to join in, because I sometimes include him with my other friends, but this hangout was supposed to be a bit more intimate. Josh has hung out with them before - only once - so he's not as involved in this group. I don't want to purposely exclude him, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this situation. Am I being unreasonable?

TL;DR:","I want to ask out a girl on a date, general tips needed. I'm 18, she's 18, what should I expect?","Girl ignored me again, I cease conversation. Happen to run into her on campus. Should I try talking to her again?",11.0,-1.263671875,29,-4.1328125,27,wins

TL;DR:",Girlfriend of 1 1/2 years has done some unfair things to me. I caught her texting the guy she ended it with. I plan on ending it probably this week. But I have a good paying job for my age but unfortunately it drug tests randomly. So I have to quit but it's gonna be a lot harder to get her off my mind that way.  My intentions were to move after I believe I have enough money to move out and live with my best friend. But if I end it with her there is nothing left for me In this town and l probably will be extremely depressed. Regardless I need to end,My gf is texting the dude she dumped me originally for and im conflicted on where to go next with work and other things.,55.0,-4.32421875,128,-1.345703125,29,lose
